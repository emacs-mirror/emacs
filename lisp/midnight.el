;;; Commentary:

;; To use the file, put (require 'midnight) into your .emacs.  Then, at
;; midnight, Emacs will run the normal hook `midnight-hook'.  You can
;; put whatever you like there, say, `calendar'; by default there is
;; only one function there - `clean-buffer-list'. It will kill the
;; buffers matching `clean-buffer-list-kill-buffer-names' and
;; `clean-buffer-list-kill-regexps' and the buffers which where last
;; displayed more than `clean-buffer-list-delay-general' days ago,
;; keeping `clean-buffer-list-kill-never-buffer-names' and
;; `clean-buffer-list-kill-never-regexps'.
