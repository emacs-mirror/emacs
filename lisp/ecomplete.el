;;; Commentary:

;; ecomplete stores matches in a file that looks like this:
;;
;; ((mail
;;  ("larsi@gnus.org" 38154 1516109510 "Lars Ingebrigtsen <larsi@gnus.org>")
;;  ("kfogel@red-bean.com" 10 1516065455 "Karl Fogel <kfogel@red-bean.com>")
;;  ...
;;  ))
;;
;; That is, it's an alist map where the key is the "type" of match (so
;; that you can have one list of things for `mail' and one for, say,
;; `twitter').  In each of these sections you then have a list where
;; each item is on the form
;;
;; (KEY TIMES-USED LAST-TIME-USED STRING)
;;
;; If you call `ecomplete-display-matches', it will then display all
;; items that match STRING.  KEY is unique and is used to identify the
;; item, and is used for updates.  For instance, if given the above
;; data, you call
;;
;; (ecomplete-add-item "larsi@gnus.org" 'mail "Lars Magne Ingebrigtsen <larsi@gnus.org>")
;;
;; the "larsi@gnus.org" entry will then be updated with that new STRING.

;; The interface functions are `ecomplete-add-item' and
;; `ecomplete-display-matches', while `ecomplete-setup' should be
;; called to read the .ecompleterc file, and `ecomplete-save' are
;; called to save the file.
