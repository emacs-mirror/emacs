;;; Commentary:

;; This major mode is mostly intended as a parent of other programming
;; modes.  All major modes for programming languages should derive from this
;; mode so that users can put generic customization on prog-mode-hook.

  "When non-nil, provides context for indenting embedded code chunks.

There are languages where part of the code is actually written in
a sub language, e.g., a Yacc/Bison or ANTLR grammar can also include
JS or Python code.  This variable enables the primary mode of the
main language to use the indentation engine of the sub-mode for
lines in code chunks written in the sub-mode's language.

When a major mode of such a main language decides to delegate the
indentation of a line/region to the indentation engine of the sub
mode, it should bind this variable to non-nil around the call.

The non-nil value should be a list of the form:

   (FIRST-COLUMN . REST)

FIRST-COLUMN is the column the indentation engine of the sub-mode
should use for top-level language constructs inside the code
chunk (instead of 0).

REST is currently unused.")
