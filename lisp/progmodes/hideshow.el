;;; Commentary:

;; * Commands provided
;;
;; This file provides Hideshow Minor Mode.  When active, nine commands
;; are available, implementing block hiding and showing.  They (and their
;; keybindings) are:
;;
;;   `hs-hide-block'                      C-c @ C-h
;;   `hs-show-block'                      C-c @ C-s
;;   `hs-hide-all'                        C-c @ C-M-h
;;   `hs-show-all'                        C-c @ C-M-s
;;   `hs-hide-level'                      C-c @ C-l
;;   `hs-toggle-hiding'                   C-c @ C-c
;;   `hs-toggle-hiding'                   S-<mouse-2>
;;   `hs-hide-initial-comment-block'
;;
;; Blocks are defined per mode.  In c-mode, c++-mode and java-mode, they
;; are simply text between curly braces, while in Lisp-ish modes parens
;; are used.  Multi-line comment blocks can also be hidden.  Read-only
;; buffers are not a problem, since hideshow doesn't modify the text.
;;
;; The command `M-x hs-minor-mode' toggles the minor mode or sets it
;; (similar to other minor modes).

;; * Suggested usage
;;
;; Add the following to your init file:
;;
;;     (require 'hideshow)
;;     (add-hook 'X-mode-hook #'hs-minor-mode)       ; other modes similarly
;;
;; where X = {emacs-lisp,c,c++,perl,...}.  You can also manually toggle
;; hideshow minor mode by typing `M-x hs-minor-mode'.  After hideshow is
;; activated or deactivated, `hs-minor-mode-hook' is run with `run-hooks'.
;;
;; Additionally, Joseph Eydelnant writes:
;;   I enjoy your package hideshow.el Version 5.24 2001/02/13
;;   a lot and I've been looking for the following functionality:
;;   toggle hide/show all with a single key.
;;   Here are a few lines of code that lets me do just that.
;;
;;     (defvar my-hs-hide nil "Current state of hideshow for toggling all.")
;;     ;;;###autoload
;;     (defun my-toggle-hideshow-all () "Toggle hideshow all."
;;       (interactive)
;;       (setq my-hs-hide (not my-hs-hide))
;;       (if my-hs-hide
;;           (hs-hide-all)
;;         (hs-show-all)))
;;
;; [Your hideshow hacks here!]

;; * Customization
;;
;; You can use `M-x customize-variable' on the following variables:
;;
;; - `hs-hide-comments-when-hiding-all' -- self-explanatory!
;; - `hs-hide-all-non-comment-function' -- if non-nil, when doing a
;;                                         `hs-hide-all', this function
;;                                         is called with no arguments
;; - `hs-isearch-open'                  -- what kind of hidden blocks to
;;                                         open when doing isearch
;;
;; Some languages (e.g., Java) are deeply nested, so the normal behavior
;; of `hs-hide-all' (hiding all but top-level blocks) results in very
;; little information shown, which is not very useful.  You can use the
;; variable `hs-hide-all-non-comment-function' to implement your idea of
;; what is more useful.  For example, the following code shows the next
;; nested level in addition to the top-level:
;;
;;     (defun ttn-hs-hide-level-1 ()
;;       (when (funcall hs-looking-at-block-start-p-func)
;;         (hs-hide-level 1))
;;       (forward-sexp 1))
;;     (setq hs-hide-all-non-comment-function 'ttn-hs-hide-level-1)
;;
;; Hideshow works with incremental search (isearch) by setting the variable
;; `hs-headline', which is the line of text at the beginning of a hidden
;; block that contains a match for the search.  You can have this show up
;; in the mode line by modifying the variable `mode-line-format'.  For
;; example, the following code prepends this info to the mode line:
;;
;;     (unless (memq 'hs-headline mode-line-format)
;;       (setq mode-line-format
;;             (append '("-" hs-headline) mode-line-format)))
;;
;; See documentation for `mode-line-format' for more info.
;;
;; Hooks are run after some commands:
;;
;;   hs-hide-hook     in      hs-hide-block, hs-hide-all, hs-hide-level
;;   hs-show-hook             hs-show-block, hs-show-all
;;
;; One of `hs-hide-hook' or `hs-show-hook' is run for the toggling
;; commands when the result of the toggle is to hide or show blocks,
;; respectively.  All hooks are run with `run-hooks'.  See the
;; documentation for each variable or hook for more information.
;;
;; Normally, hideshow tries to determine appropriate values for block
;; and comment definitions by examining the buffer's major mode.  If
;; there are problems, hideshow will not activate and in that case you
;; may wish to override hideshow's heuristics by adding an entry to
;; variable `hs-special-modes-alist'.  Packages that use hideshow should
;; do something like:
;;
;;   (add-to-list 'hs-special-modes-alist '(my-mode "{{" "}}" ...))
;;
;; If you have an entry that works particularly well, consider
;; submitting it for inclusion in hideshow.el.  See docstring for
;; `hs-special-modes-alist' for more info on the entry format.
;;
;; See also variable `hs-set-up-overlay' for per-block customization of
;; appearance or other effects associated with overlays.  For example:
;;
;; (setq hs-set-up-overlay
;;       (defun my-display-code-line-counts (ov)
;;         (when (eq 'code (overlay-get ov 'hs))
;;           (overlay-put ov 'display
;;                        (propertize
;;                         (format " ... <%d>"
;;                                 (count-lines (overlay-start ov)
;;                                              (overlay-end ov)))
;;                         'face 'font-lock-type-face)))))

;; * Bugs
;;
;; (1) Sometimes `hs-headline' can become out of sync.  To reset, type
;;     `M-x hs-minor-mode' twice (that is, deactivate then re-activate
;;     hideshow).
;;
;; (2) Some buffers can't be `byte-compile-file'd properly.  This is because
;;     `byte-compile-file' inserts the file to be compiled in a temporary
;;     buffer and switches `normal-mode' on.  In the case where you have
;;     `hs-hide-initial-comment-block' in `hs-minor-mode-hook', the hiding of
;;     the initial comment sometimes hides parts of the first statement (seems
;;     to be only in `normal-mode'), so there are unbalanced "(" and ")".
;;
;;     The workaround is to clear `hs-minor-mode-hook' when byte-compiling:
;;
;;     (defadvice byte-compile-file (around
;;                                   byte-compile-file-hideshow-off
;;                                   act)
;;       (let ((hs-minor-mode-hook nil))
;;         ad-do-it))
;;
;; (3) Hideshow interacts badly with Ediff and `vc-diff'.  At the moment, the
;;     suggested workaround is to turn off hideshow entirely, for example:
;;
;;     (add-hook 'ediff-prepare-buffer-hook #'turn-off-hideshow)
;;     (add-hook 'vc-before-checkin-hook #'turn-off-hideshow)
;;
;;     In the case of `vc-diff', here is a less invasive workaround:
;;
;;     (add-hook 'vc-before-checkin-hook
;;               (lambda ()
;;                 (goto-char (point-min))
;;                 (hs-show-block)))
;;
;;     Unfortunately, these workarounds do not restore hideshow state.
;;     If someone figures out a better way, please let me know.

;;
;; Special thanks go to Dan Nicolaescu, who reimplemented hideshow using
;; overlays (rather than selective display), added isearch magic, folded
;; in custom.el compatibility, generalized comment handling, incorporated
;; mouse support, and maintained the code in general.  Version 4.0 is
;; largely due to his efforts.

;; * History
;;
;; Hideshow was inspired when I learned about selective display.  It was
;; reimplemented to use overlays for 4.0 (see above).  WRT older history,
;; entries in the masterfile corresponding to versions 1.x and 2.x have
;; been lost.  XEmacs support is reliable as of 4.29.  State save and
;; restore was added in 3.5 (not widely distributed), and reliable as of
;; 4.30.  Otherwise, the code seems stable.  Passes checkdoc as of 4.32.
;; Version 5.x uses new algorithms for block selection and traversal,
;; unbundles state save and restore, and includes more isearch support.

Each element has the form
  (MODE START END COMMENT-START FORWARD-SEXP-FUNC ADJUST-BEG-FUNC
   FIND-BLOCK-BEGINNING-FUNC FIND-NEXT-BLOCK-FUNC
   LOOKING-AT-BLOCK-START-P-FUNC).

If non-nil, hideshow will use these values as regexps to define blocks
and comments, respectively for major mode MODE.

START, END and COMMENT-START are regular expressions.  A block is
defined as text surrounded by START and END.

As a special case, START may be a list of the form (COMPLEX-START
MDATA-SELECTOR), where COMPLEX-START is a regexp with multiple parts and
MDATA-SELECTOR an integer that specifies which sub-match is the proper
place to adjust point, before calling `hs-forward-sexp-func'.  Point
is adjusted to the beginning of the specified match.  For example,
see the `hs-special-modes-alist' entry for `bibtex-mode'.

For some major modes, `forward-sexp' does not work properly.  In those
cases, FORWARD-SEXP-FUNC specifies another function to use instead.

See the documentation for `hs-adjust-block-beginning' to see what is the
use of ADJUST-BEG-FUNC.

See the documentation for `hs-find-block-beginning-func' to see
what is the use of FIND-BLOCK-BEGINNING-FUNC.

See the documentation for `hs-find-next-block-func' to see what
is the use of FIND-NEXT-BLOCK-FUNC.

See the documentation for `hs-looking-at-block-start-p-func' to
see what is the use of LOOKING-AT-BLOCK-START-P-FUNC.
