;;; Commentary:

;; Major mode for editing shell scripts.  Bourne, C and rc shells as well
;; as various derivatives are supported and easily derived from.  Structured
;; statements can be inserted with one command or abbrev.  Completion is
;; available for filenames, variables known from the script, the shell and
;; the environment as well as commands.

;;; Known Bugs:

;; - In Bourne the keyword `in' is not anchored to case, for, select ...
;; - Variables in `"' strings aren't fontified because there's no way of
;;   syntactically distinguishing those from `'' strings.

;;		Indentation
;;	 	===========
;; Indentation for rc and es modes is very limited, but for Bourne shells
;; and its derivatives it is quite customizable.
;;
;; The following description applies to sh and derived shells (bash,
;; zsh, ...).
;;
;; There are various customization variables which allow tailoring to
;; a wide variety of styles.  Most of these variables are named
;; sh-indent-for-XXX and sh-indent-after-XXX.  For example.
;; sh-indent-after-if controls the indenting of a line following
;; an if statement, and sh-indent-for-fi controls the indentation
;; of the line containing the fi.
;;
;; You can set each to a numeric value, but it is often more convenient
;; to a symbol such as `+' which uses the value of variable `sh-basic-offset'.
;; By changing this one variable you can increase or decrease how much
;; indentation there is.  Valid symbols:
;;
;; 	+   Indent right by sh-basic-offset
;; 	-   Indent left  by sh-basic-offset
;; 	++  Indent right twice sh-basic-offset
;; 	--  Indent left  twice sh-basic-offset
;; 	*   Indent right half sh-basic-offset
;; 	/   Indent left  half sh-basic-offset.
;;
;; 	Saving indentation values
;; 	-------------------------
;; After you've learned the values in a buffer, how to you remember them?
;; There is a minimal way of being able to save indentation values and
;; to reload them in another buffer or at another point in time.
;;
;; Use `sh-name-style' to give a name to the indentation settings of
;; 	the current buffer.
;; Use `sh-load-style' to load indentation settings for the current
;; 	buffer from a specific style.
;; Use `sh-save-styles-to-buffer' to write all the styles to a buffer
;; 	in lisp code.  You can then store it in a file and later use
;; 	`load-file' to load it.
;;
;; 	Indentation variables - buffer local or global?
;; 	----------------------------------------------
;; I think that often having them buffer-local makes sense,
;; especially if one is using `smie-config-guess'.  However, if
;; a user sets values using customization, these changes won't appear
;; to work if the variables are already local!
;;
;; To get round this, there is a variable `sh-make-vars-local' and 2
;; functions: `sh-make-vars-local' and `sh-reset-indent-vars-to-global-values'.
;;
;; If `sh-make-vars-local' is non-nil, then these variables become
;; buffer local when the mode is established.
;; If this is nil, then the variables are global.  At any time you
;; can make them local with the command `sh-make-vars-local'.
;; Conversely, to update with the global values you can use the
;; command `sh-reset-indent-vars-to-global-values'.
;;
;; This may be awkward, but the intent is to cover all cases.
;;
;; 	Awkward things, pitfalls
;; 	------------------------
;; Indentation for a sh script is complicated for a number of reasons:
;;
;; 1. You can't format by simply looking at symbols, you need to look
;;    at keywords.  [This is not the case for rc and es shells.]
;; 2. The character ")" is used both as a matched pair "(" ... ")" and
;;    as a stand-alone symbol (in a case alternative).  This makes
;;    things quite tricky!
;; 3. Here-documents in a script should be treated "as is", and when
;;    they terminate we want to revert to the indentation of the line
;;    containing the "<<" symbol.
;; 4. A line may be continued using the "\".
;; 5. The character "#" (outside a string) normally starts a comment,
;;    but it doesn't in the sequence "$#"!
;;
;; To try and address points 2 3 and 5 I used a feature that cperl mode
;; uses, that of a text's syntax property.  This, however, has 2
;; disadvantages:
;; 1. We need to scan the buffer to find which ")" symbols belong to a
;;    case alternative, to find any here documents, and handle "$#".
;;
;; 	Bugs
;; 	----
;; - Indenting many lines is slow.  It currently does each line
;;   independently, rather than saving state information.
;;
;; - "echo $z in ps | head)" the last ) is mis-identified as being part of
;;   a case-pattern.  You need to put the "in" between quotes to coerce
;;   sh-script into doing the right thing.

(define-derived-mode sh-mode prog-mode "Shell-script"
  "Major mode for editing shell scripts.
This mode works for many shells, since they all have roughly the same syntax,
as far as commands, arguments, variables, pipes, comments etc. are concerned.
Unless the file's magic number indicates the shell, your usual shell is
assumed.  Since filenames rarely give a clue, they are not further analyzed.

This mode adapts to the variations between shells (see `sh-set-shell') by
means of an inheritance based feature lookup (see `sh-feature').  This
mechanism applies to all variables (including skeletons) that pertain to
shell-specific features.  Shell script files can use the `sh-shell' local
variable to indicate the shell variant to be used for the file.

The default style of this mode is that of Rosenblatt's Korn shell book.
The syntax of the statements varies with the shell being used.  The
following commands are available, based on the current shell's syntax:
\\<sh-mode-map>
\\[sh-case]	 case statement
\\[sh-for]	 for loop
\\[sh-function]	 function definition
\\[sh-if]	 if statement
\\[sh-indexed-loop]	 indexed loop from 1 to n
\\[sh-while-getopts]	 while getopts loop
\\[sh-repeat]	 repeat loop
\\[sh-select]	 select loop
\\[sh-until]	 until loop
\\[sh-while]	 while loop

For sh and rc shells indentation commands are:
\\[smie-config-show-indent]	Show the rules controlling this line's indentation.
\\[smie-config-set-indent]	Change the rules controlling this line's indentation.
\\[smie-config-guess]  Try to tweak the indentation rules so the
buffer indents as it currently is indented.


\\[backward-delete-char-untabify]	 Delete backward one position, even if it was a tab.
\\[sh-end-of-command]	 Go to end of successive commands.
\\[sh-beginning-of-command]	 Go to beginning of successive commands.
\\[sh-set-shell]	 Set this buffer's shell, and maybe its magic number.
\\[sh-execute-region]	 Have optional header and region be executed in a subshell.

`sh-electric-here-document-mode' controls whether insertion of two
unquoted < insert a here document.  You can control this behavior by
modifying `sh-mode-hook'.

If you generally program a shell different from your login shell you can
set `sh-shell-file' accordingly.  If your shell's file name doesn't correctly
indicate what shell it is use `sh-alias-alist' to translate.

If your shell gives error messages with line numbers, you can use \\[executable-interpret]
with your script for an edit-interpret-debug cycle."
