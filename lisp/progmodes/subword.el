;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides the `subword' minor mode, which merges the
;; old remap-based subword.el (derived from cc-mode code) and
;; cap-words.el, which takes advantage of core Emacs
;; word-motion-customization functionality.

;; In spite of GNU Coding Standards, it is popular to name a symbol by
;; mixing uppercase and lowercase letters, e.g. "GtkWidget",
;; "EmacsFrameClass", "NSGraphicsContext", etc.  Here we call these
;; mixed case symbols `nomenclatures'.  Also, each capitalized (or
;; completely uppercase) part of a nomenclature is called a `subword'.
;; Here are some examples:

;;  Nomenclature           Subwords
;;  ===========================================================
;;  GtkWindow          =>  "Gtk" and "Window"
;;  EmacsFrameClass    =>  "Emacs", "Frame" and "Class"
;;  NSGraphicsContext  =>  "NS", "Graphics" and "Context"

;; The subword oriented commands defined in this package recognize
;; subwords in a nomenclature to move between them and to edit them as
;; words.  You also get a mode to treat symbols as words instead,
;; called `superword-mode' (the opposite of `subword-mode').

;; To make the mode turn on automatically, put the following code in
;; your .emacs:
;;
;; (add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook 'subword-mode)
;;

;; To make the mode turn `superword-mode' on automatically for
;; only some modes, put the following code in your .emacs:
;;
;; (add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook 'superword-mode)
;;

;; Acknowledgment:
;; The regular expressions to detect subwords are mostly based on
;; the old `c-forward-into-nomenclature' originally contributed by
;; Terry_Glanfield dot Southern at rxuk dot xerox dot com.

;; TODO: ispell-word.

Subword mode is a buffer-local minor mode.  Enabling it changes
the definition of a word so that word-based commands stop inside
symbols with mixed uppercase and lowercase letters,
e.g. \"GtkWidget\", \"EmacsFrameClass\", \"NSGraphicsContext\".

Here we call these mixed case symbols `nomenclatures'.  Each
capitalized (or completely uppercase) part of a nomenclature is
called a `subword'.  Here are some examples:

  Nomenclature           Subwords
  ===========================================================
  GtkWindow          =>  \"Gtk\" and \"Window\"
  EmacsFrameClass    =>  \"Emacs\", \"Frame\" and \"Class\"
  NSGraphicsContext  =>  \"NS\", \"Graphics\" and \"Context\"

treat nomenclature boundaries as word boundaries."

;; This way, all word-related activities, not just the images we
