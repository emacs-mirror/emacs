;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Flymake is a minor Emacs mode performing on-the-fly syntax checks.
;;
;; Flymake collects diagnostic information for multiple sources,
;; called backends, and visually annotates the relevant portions in
;; the buffer.
;;
;; This file contains the UI for displaying and interacting with the
;; results produced by these backends, as well as entry points for
;; backends to hook on to.
;;
;; The main interactive entry point is the `flymake-mode' minor mode,
;; which periodically and automatically initiates checks as the user
;; is editing the buffer.  The variables `flymake-no-changes-timeout',
;; `flymake-start-on-flymake-mode' give finer control over the events
;; triggering a check, as does the interactive command  `flymake-start',
;; which immediately starts a check.
;;
;; Shortly after each check, a summary of collected diagnostics should
;; appear in the mode-line.  If it doesn't, there might not be a
;; suitable Flymake backend for the current buffer's major mode, in
;; which case Flymake will indicate this in the mode-line.  The
;; indicator will be `!' (exclamation mark), if all the configured
;; backends errored (or decided to disable themselves) and `?'
;; (question mark) if no backends were even configured.
;;
;; For programmers interested in writing a new Flymake backend, the
;; docstring of `flymake-diagnostic-functions', the Flymake manual, and the
;; code of existing backends are probably good starting points.
;;
;; The user wishing to customize the appearance of error types should
;; set properties on the symbols associated with each diagnostic type.
;; The standard diagnostic symbols are `:error', `:warning' and
;; `:note' (though a specific backend may define and use more).  The
;; following properties can be set:
;;
;; * `flymake-bitmap', an image displayed in the fringe according to
;; `flymake-fringe-indicator-position'.  The value actually follows
;; the syntax of `flymake-error-bitmap' (which see).  It is overridden
;; by any `before-string' overlay property.
;;
;; * `flymake-severity', a non-negative integer specifying the
;; diagnostic's severity.  The higher, the more serious.  If the
;; overlay property `priority' is not specified, `severity' is used to
;; set it and help sort overlapping overlays.
;;
;; * `flymake-overlay-control', an alist ((OVPROP . VALUE) ...) of
;; further properties used to affect the appearance of Flymake
;; annotations.  With the exception of `category' and `evaporate',
;; these properties are applied directly to the created overlay.  See
;; Info Node `(elisp)Overlay Properties'.
;;
;; * `flymake-category', a symbol whose property list is considered a
;; default for missing values of any other properties.  This is useful
;; to backend authors when creating new diagnostic types that differ
;; from an existing type by only a few properties.  The category
;; symbols `flymake-error', `flymake-warning' and `flymake-note' make
;; good candidates for values of this property.
;;
;; For instance, to omit the fringe bitmap displayed for the standard
;; `:note' type, set its `flymake-bitmap' property to nil:
;;
;;   (put :note 'flymake-bitmap nil)
;;
;; To change the face for `:note' type, add a `face' entry to its
;; `flymake-overlay-control' property.
;;
;;   (push '(face . highlight) (get :note 'flymake-overlay-control))
;;
;; If you push another alist entry in front, it overrides the previous
;; one.  So this effectively removes the face from `:note'
;; diagnostics.
;;
;;   (push '(face . nil) (get :note 'flymake-overlay-control))
;;
;; To erase customizations and go back to the original look for
;; `:note' types:
;;
;;   (cl-remf (symbol-plist :note) 'flymake-overlay-control)
;;   (cl-remf (symbol-plist :note) 'flymake-bitmap)

(defvar flymake-diagnostic-functions nil
  "Special hook of Flymake backends that check a buffer.

The functions in this hook diagnose problems in a buffer's
contents and provide information to the Flymake user interface
about where and how to annotate problems diagnosed in a buffer.

Each backend function must be prepared to accept an arbitrary
number of arguments:

* the first argument is always REPORT-FN, a callback function
  detailed below;

* the remaining arguments are keyword-value pairs in the
  form (:KEY VALUE :KEY2 VALUE2...).

Currently, Flymake may provide these keyword-value pairs:

* `:recent-changes', a list of recent changes since the last time
  the backend function was called for the buffer.  An empty list
  indicates that no changes have been recorded.  If it is the
  first time that this backend function is called for this
  activation of `flymake-mode', then this argument isn't provided
  at all (i.e. it's not merely nil).

  Each element is in the form (BEG END TEXT) where BEG and END
  are buffer positions, and TEXT is a string containing the text
  contained between those positions (if any) after the change was
  performed.

* `:changes-start' and `:changes-end', the minimum and maximum
  buffer positions touched by the recent changes.  These are only
  provided if `:recent-changes' is also provided.

Whenever Flymake or the user decides to re-check the buffer,
backend functions are called as detailed above and are expected
to initiate this check, but aren't required to complete it before
exiting: if the computation involved is expensive, especially for
large buffers, that task can be scheduled for the future using
asynchronous processes or other asynchronous mechanisms.

In any case, backend functions are expected to return quickly or
signal an error, in which case the backend is disabled.  Flymake
will not try disabled backends again for any future checks of
this buffer.  To reset the list of disabled backends, turn
`flymake-mode' off and on again, or interactively call
`flymake-start' with a prefix argument.

If the function returns, Flymake considers the backend to be
\"running\".  If it has not done so already, the backend is
expected to call the function REPORT-FN with a single argument
REPORT-ACTION also followed by an optional list of keyword-value
pairs in the form (:REPORT-KEY VALUE :REPORT-KEY2 VALUE2...).

Currently accepted values for REPORT-ACTION are:

* A (possibly empty) list of diagnostic objects created with
  `flymake-make-diagnostic', causing Flymake to delete all
  previous diagnostic annotations in the buffer and create new
  ones from this list.

  A backend may call REPORT-FN repeatedly in this manner, but
  only until Flymake considers that the most recently requested
  buffer check is now obsolete because, say, buffer contents have
  changed in the meantime.  The backend is only given notice of
  this via a renewed call to the backend function.  Thus, to
  prevent making obsolete reports and wasting resources, backend
  functions should first cancel any ongoing processing from
  previous calls.

* The symbol `:panic', signaling that the backend has encountered
  an exceptional situation and should be disabled.

Currently accepted REPORT-KEY arguments are:

* `:explanation' value should give user-readable details of
  the situation encountered, if any.

* `:force': value should be a boolean suggesting that Flymake
  consider the report even if it was somehow unexpected.

* `:region': a cons (BEG . END) of buffer positions indicating
  that the report applies to that region only.  Specifically,
  this means that Flymake will only delete diagnostic annotations
  of past reports if they intersect the region by at least one
  character.")

  "Toggle Flymake mode on or off.

Flymake is an Emacs minor mode for on-the-fly syntax checking.
Flymake collects diagnostic information from multiple sources,
called backends, and visually annotates the buffer with the
results.

Flymake performs these checks while the user is editing.
The customization variables `flymake-start-on-flymake-mode',
`flymake-no-changes-timeout' determine the exact circumstances
whereupon Flymake decides to initiate a check of the buffer.

The commands `flymake-goto-next-error' and
`flymake-goto-prev-error' can be used to navigate among Flymake
diagnostics annotated in the buffer.

By default, `flymake-mode' doesn't override the \\[next-error] command, but
if you're using Flymake a lot (and don't use the regular compilation
mechanisms that often), it can be useful to put something like
the following in your init file:

  (setq next-error-function \\='flymake-goto-next-error)

The visual appearance of each type of diagnostic can be changed
by setting properties `flymake-overlay-control', `flymake-bitmap'
and `flymake-severity' on the symbols of diagnostic types (like
`:error', `:warning' and `:note').

Activation or deactivation of backends used by Flymake in each
buffer happens via the special hook
`flymake-diagnostic-functions'.

Some backends may take longer than others to respond or complete,
and some may decide to disable themselves if they are not
suitable for the current buffer.  The commands
`flymake-running-backends', `flymake-disabled-backends' and
`flymake-reporting-backends' summarize the situation, as does the
special *Flymake log* buffer."  :group 'flymake :lighter
