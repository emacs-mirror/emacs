;;; Commentary:

;; lua-mode provides support for editing Lua, including automatic
;; indentation, syntactical font-locking, running interactive shell,
;; Flymake checks with luacheck, interacting with `hs-minor-mode' and
;; online documentation lookup.
;;
;; The following variables are available for customization (see more via
;; `M-x customize-group lua`):
;;
;; - Var `lua-indent-level':
;;   indentation offset in spaces
;; - Var `lua-indent-string-contents':
;;   set to `t` if you like to have contents of multiline strings to be
;;   indented like comments
;; - Var `lua-indent-nested-block-content-align':
;;   set to `nil' to stop aligning the content of nested blocks with the
;;   open parenthesis
;; - Var `lua-indent-close-paren-align':
;;   set to `t' to align close parenthesis with the open parenthesis,
;;   rather than with the beginning of the line
;; - Var `lua-mode-hook':
;;   list of functions to execute when lua-mode is initialized
;; - Var `lua-documentation-url':
;;   base URL for documentation lookup
;; - Var `lua-documentation-function': function used to
;;   show documentation (`eww` is a viable alternative for Emacs 25)
;;
;; These are variables/commands that operate on the Lua process:
;;
;; - Var `lua-default-application':
;;   command to start the Lua process (REPL)
;; - Var `lua-default-command-switches':
;;   arguments to pass to the Lua process on startup (make sure `-i` is
;;   there if you expect working with Lua shell interactively)
;; - Cmd `lua-start-process': start new REPL process, usually happens
;;   automatically
;; - Cmd `lua-kill-process': kill current REPL process
;;
;; These are variables/commands for interaction with the Lua process:
;;
;; - Cmd `lua-show-process-buffer': switch to REPL buffer
;; - Cmd `lua-hide-process-buffer': hide window showing REPL buffer
;; - Var `lua-always-show': show REPL buffer after sending something
;; - Cmd `lua-send-buffer': send whole buffer
;; - Cmd `lua-send-current-line': send current line
;; - Cmd `lua-send-defun': send current top-level function
;; - Cmd `lua-send-region': send active region
;; - Cmd `lua-restart-with-whole-file': restart REPL and send whole buffer
;;
;; To enable on-the-fly linting, make sure you have the luacheck program
;; installed (available from luarocks) and activate `flymake-mode'.
;;
;; See "M-x apropos-command ^lua-" for a list of commands.
;; See "M-x customize-group lua" for a list of customizable variables.
