;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This package implements Parsing Expression Grammars for Emacs Lisp.

;; Parsing Expression Grammars (PEG) are a formalism in the spirit of
;; Context Free Grammars (CFG) with some simplifications which makes
;; the implementation of PEGs as recursive descent parsers particularly
;; simple and easy to understand [Ford, Baker].
;; PEGs are more expressive than regexps and potentially easier to use.
;;
;; This file implements the macros `define-peg-rule', `with-peg-rules', and
;; `peg-parse' which parses the current buffer according to a PEG.
;; E.g. we can match integers with:
;;
;;     (with-peg-rules
;;         ((number sign digit (* digit))
;;          (sign   (or "+" "-" ""))
;;          (digit  [0-9]))
;;       (peg-run (peg number)))
;; or
;;     (define-peg-rule digit ()
;;       [0-9])
;;     (peg-parse (number sign digit (* digit))
;;                (sign   (or "+" "-" "")))
;;
;; In contrast to regexps, PEGs allow us to define recursive "rules".
;; A "grammar" is a set of rules.  A rule is written as (NAME PEX...)
;; E.g. (sign (or "+" "-" "")) is a rule with the name "sign".
;; The syntax for PEX (Parsing Expression) is a follows:
;;
;;     Description		Lisp		Traditional, as in Ford's paper
;;     ===========		====		===========
;;     Sequence			(and E1 E2)	e1 e2
;;     Prioritized Choice	(or E1 E2)	e1 / e2
;;     Not-predicate		(not E)		!e
;;     And-predicate		(if E)		&e
;;     Any character		(any)		.
;;     Literal string		"abc"		"abc"
;;     Character C		(char C)	'c'
;;     Zero-or-more		(* E)		e*
;;     One-or-more		(+ E)		e+
;;     Optional			(opt E)		e?
;;     Non-terminal             SYMBOL		A
;;     Character range		(range A B)	[a-b]
;;     Character set		[a-b "+*" ?x]	[a-b+*x]   ;Note: it's a vector
;;     Character classes	[ascii cntrl]
;;     Boolean-guard		(guard EXP)
;;     Syntax-Class		(syntax-class NAME)
;;     Local definitions	(with RULES PEX...)
;;     Indirect call            (funcall EXP ARGS...)
;; and
;;     Empty-string		(null)		Îµ
;;     Beginning-of-Buffer	(bob)
;;     End-of-Buffer		(eob)
;;     Beginning-of-Line	(bol)
;;     End-of-Line		(eol)
;;     Beginning-of-Word	(bow)
;;     End-of-Word		(eow)
;;     Beginning-of-Symbol	(bos)
;;     End-of-Symbol		(eos)
;;
;; Rules can refer to other rules, and a grammar is often structured
;; as a tree, with a root rule referring to one or more "branch
;; rules", all the way down to the "leaf rules" that deal with actual
;; buffer text.  Rules can be recursive or mutually referential,
;; though care must be taken not to create infinite loops.
;;
;;;; Named rulesets:
;;
;; You can define a set of rules for later use with:
;;
;;     (define-peg-ruleset myrules
;;       (sign  () (or "+" "-" ""))
;;       (digit () [0-9])
;;       (nat   () digit (* digit))
;;       (int   () sign digit (* digit))
;;       (float () int "." nat))
;;
;; and later refer to it:
;;
;;     (with-peg-rules
;;         (myrules
;;          (complex float "+i" float))
;;       ... (peg-parse nat "," nat "," complex) ...)
;;
;;;; Parsing actions:
;;
;; PEXs also support parsing actions, i.e. Lisp snippets which are
;; executed when a pex matches.  This can be used to construct syntax
;; trees or for similar tasks.  The most basic form of action is
;; written as:
;;
;;     (action FORM)          ; evaluate FORM for its side-effects
;;
;; Actions don't consume input, but are executed at the point of
;; match.  Another kind of action is called a "stack action", and
;; looks like this:
;;
;;     `(VAR... -- FORM...)   ; stack action
;;
;; A stack action takes VARs from the "value stack" and pushes the
;; results of evaluating FORMs to that stack.

;; The value stack is created during the course of parsing.  Certain
;; operators (see below) that match buffer text can push values onto
;; this stack.  "Upstream" rules can then draw values from the stack,
;; and optionally push new ones back.  For instance, consider this
;; very simple grammar:
;;
;; (with-peg-rules
;;     ((query (+ term) (eol))
;;      (term key ":" value (opt (+ [space]))
;; 	   `(k v -- (cons (intern k) v)))
;;      (key (substring (and (not ":") (+ [word]))))
;;      (value (or string-value number-value))
;;      (string-value (substring (+ [alpha])))
;;      (number-value (substring (+ [digit]))
;; 		   `(val -- (string-to-number val))))
;;   (peg-run (peg query)))
;;
;; This invocation of `peg-run' would parse this buffer text:
;;
;; name:Jane age:30
;;
;; And return this Elisp sexp:
;;
;; ((age . 30) (name . "Jane"))
;;
;; Note that, in complex grammars, some care must be taken to make
;; sure that the number and type of values drawn from the stack always
;; match those pushed.  In the example above, both `string-value' and
;; `number-value' push a single value to the stack.  Since the `value'
;; rule only includes these two sub-rules, any upstream rule that
;; makes use of `value' can be confident it will always and only push
;; a single value to the stack.
;;
;; Stack action forms are in a sense analogous to lambda forms: the
;; symbols before the "--" are the equivalent of lambda arguments,
;; while the forms after the "--" are return values.  The difference
;; being that a lambda form can only return a single value, while a
;; stack action can push multiple values onto the stack.  It's also
;; perfectly valid to use `(-- FORM...)' or `(VAR... --)': the former
;; pushes values to the stack without consuming any, and the latter
;; pops values from the stack and discards them.
;;
;;;; Derived Operators:
;;
;; The following operators are implemented as combinations of
;; primitive expressions:
;;
;;     (substring E)  ; Match E and push the substring for the matched region.
;;     (region E)     ; Match E and push the start and end positions.
;;     (replace E RPL); Match E and replace the matched region with RPL.
;;     (list E)       ; Match E and push a list of the items that E produced.
;;
;; See `peg-ex-parse-int' in `peg-tests.el' for further examples.
;;
;; Regexp equivalents:
;;
;; Here a some examples for regexps and how those could be written as pex.
;; [Most are taken from rx.el]
;;
;;     "^[a-z]*"
;;     (and (bol) (* [a-z]))
;;
;;     "\n[^ \t]"
;;     (and "\n" (not [" \t"]) (any))
;;
;;     "\\*\\*\\* EOOH \\*\\*\\*\n"
;;     "*** EOOH ***\n"
;;
;;     "\\<\\(catch\\|finally\\)\\>[^_]"
;;     (and (bow) (or "catch" "finally") (eow) (not "_") (any))
;;
;;     "[ \t\n]*:\\([^:]+\\|$\\)"
;;     (and (* [" \t\n"]) ":" (or (+ (not ":") (any)) (eol)))
;;
;;     "^content-transfer-encoding:\\(\n?[\t ]\\)*quoted-printable\\(\n?[\t ]\\)*"
;;     (and (bol)
;;          "content-transfer-encoding:"
;;          (* (opt "\n") ["\t "])
;;          "quoted-printable"
;;          (* (opt "\n") ["\t "]))
;;
;;     "\\$[I]d: [^ ]+ \\([^ ]+\\) "
;;     (and "$Id: " (+ (not " ") (any)) " " (+ (not " ") (any)) " ")
;;
;;     "^;;\\s-*\n\\|^\n"
;;     (or (and (bol) ";;" (* (syntax-class whitespace)) "\n")
;;         (and (bol) "\n"))
;;
;;     "\\\\\\\\\\[\\w+"
;;     (and "\\\\[" (+ (syntax-class word)))
;;
;; See ";;; Examples" in `peg-tests.el' for other examples.
;;
;;;; Rule argument and indirect calls:
;;
;; Rules can take arguments and those arguments can themselves be PEGs.
;; For example:
;;
;;     (define-peg-rule 2-or-more (peg)
;;       (funcall peg)
;;       (funcall peg)
;;       (* (funcall peg)))
;;
;;     ... (peg-parse
;;          ...
;;          (2-or-more (peg foo))
;;          ...
;;          (2-or-more (peg bar))
;;          ...)

;;;; Todo:

;; - Fix the exponential blowup in `peg-translate-exp'.
;; - Add a proper debug-spec for PEXs.

;;; News:

;; Since 1.0.1:
;; - Use OClosures to represent PEG rules when available, and let cl-print
;;   display their source code.
;; - New PEX form (with RULES PEX...).
;; - Named rulesets.
;; - You can pass arguments to rules.
;; - New `funcall' rule to call rules indirectly (e.g. a peg you received
;;   as argument).

;; Version 1.0:
;; - New official entry points `peg` and `peg-run`.

;;; Code:
