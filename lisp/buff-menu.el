\\[Buffer-menu-this-window]  Select current line's buffer in place of the buffer menu.
\\[Buffer-menu-other-window]    Select that buffer in another window,
     so the Buffer Menu remains visible in its window.
\\[Buffer-menu-view]    Select current line's buffer, in View mode.
\\[Buffer-menu-view-other-window]  Select that buffer in
     another window, in view-mode.
\\[Buffer-menu-switch-other-window]  Make another window display that buffer.
\\[Buffer-menu-mark]    Mark current line's buffer to be displayed.
\\[Buffer-menu-select]    Select current line's buffer.
     Also show buffers marked with m, in other windows.
\\[Buffer-menu-1-window]    Select that buffer in full-frame window.
\\[Buffer-menu-2-window]    Select that buffer in one window, together with the
     buffer selected before this one in another window.
\\[Buffer-menu-isearch-buffers]    Incremental search in the marked buffers.
\\[Buffer-menu-isearch-buffers-regexp]  Isearch for regexp in the marked buffers.
\\[Buffer-menu-multi-occur] Show lines matching regexp in the marked buffers.
\\[Buffer-menu-visit-tags-table]    visit-tags-table this buffer.
\\[Buffer-menu-not-modified]    Clear modified-flag on that buffer.
\\[Buffer-menu-save]    Mark that buffer to be saved, and move down.
\\[Buffer-menu-delete]  Mark that buffer to be deleted, and move down.
\\[Buffer-menu-delete-backwards]  Mark that buffer to be deleted, and move up.
\\[Buffer-menu-execute]    Delete or save marked buffers.
\\[Buffer-menu-unmark]    Remove all marks from current line.
     With prefix argument, also move up one line.
\\[Buffer-menu-unmark-all-buffers]    Remove a particular mark from all lines.
\\[Buffer-menu-unmark-all]    Remove all marks from all lines.
\\[Buffer-menu-backup-unmark]  Back up a line and remove marks.
\\[Buffer-menu-toggle-read-only]    Toggle read-only status of buffer on this line.
\\[revert-buffer]    Update the list of buffers.
\\[Buffer-menu-toggle-files-only]    Toggle whether the menu displays only file buffers.
