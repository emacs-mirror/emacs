an explanation and alternative ways to save the repaired value.

Explanation: For the list variable `ibuffer-saved-filters',
elements of the form (STRING (FILTER-SPECS...)) are deprecated
and should instead have the form (STRING FILTER-SPECS...), where
each filter spec is a cons cell with a symbol in the car. See
`ibuffer-saved-filters' for details. The repaired value fixes
this format without changing the meaning of the saved filters.

Alternative ways to save the repaired value:

  1. Do M-x customize-variable and entering `ibuffer-saved-filters'
     when prompted.

  2. Set the updated value manually by copying the
     following emacs-lisp form to your emacs init file.

  "A list specifying the filters currently acting on the buffer list.

If this list is nil, then no filters are currently in
effect. Otherwise, each element of this list specifies a single
filter, and all of the specified filters in the list are applied
successively to the buffer list.

Each filter specification can be of two types: simple or compound.

A simple filter specification has the form (SYMBOL . QUALIFIER),
where SYMBOL is a key in the alist `ibuffer-filtering-alist' that
determines the filter function to use and QUALIFIER is the data
passed to that function (along with the buffer being considered).

A compound filter specification can have one of four forms:

-- (not FILTER-SPEC)

   Represents the logical complement of FILTER-SPEC, which
   is any single filter specification, simple or compound.
   The form (not . FILTER-SPEC) is also accepted here.

-- (and FILTER-SPECS...)

   Represents the logical-and of the filters defined by one or
   more filter specifications FILTER-SPECS..., where each
   specification can be simple or compound.  Note that and is
   implicitly applied to the filters in the top-level list.

-- (or FILTER-SPECS...)

   Represents the logical-or of the filters defined by one or
   more filter specifications FILTER-SPECS..., where each
   specification can be simple or compound.

-- (saved . \"NAME\")

   Represents the filter saved under the string NAME
