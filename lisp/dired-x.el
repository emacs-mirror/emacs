;; At load time dired-x.el will install itself and bind some dired keys.

;; User customization: M-x customize-group RET dired-x RET.

;; *Please* see the `dired-x' Info manual for more details.

;;; GUESS SHELL COMMAND.

;;;
;; * `dired-do-shell-command' is bound to `!' by dired.el.
;;;
;; * `dired-guess-shell-command' provides smarter defaults for
;;;    dired-aux.el's `dired-read-shell-command'.
;;;
;; * `dired-guess-shell-command' calls `dired-guess-default' with list of
;;;    marked files.
;;;
;; * Parse `dired-guess-shell-alist-user' and
;;;   `dired-guess-shell-alist-default' (in that order) for the first REGEXP
;;;   that matches the first file in the file list.
;;;
;; * If the REGEXP matches all the entries of the file list then evaluate
;;;   COMMAND, which is either a string or a Lisp expression returning a
;;;   string.  COMMAND may be a list of commands.
;;;
;; * Return this command to `dired-guess-shell-command' which prompts user
;;;   with it.  The list of commands is put into the list of default values.
;;;   If a command is used successfully then it is stored permanently in
;;;   `dired-shell-command-history'.

;; Guess what shell command to apply to a file.
(defvar dired-shell-command-history nil

;;;
;; * Use `dired-get-marked-files' to collect the marked files in the current
;;;   Dired Buffer into a list of filenames `FILE-LIST'.
;;;
;; * Pass FILE-LIST to `dired-simultaneous-find-file' all with
;;;   `dired-do-find-marked-files''s prefix argument NOSELECT.
;;;
;; * `dired-simultaneous-find-file' runs through FILE-LIST decrementing the
;;;   list each time.
;;;
;; * If NOSELECT is non-nil then just run `find-file-noselect' on each
;;;   element of FILE-LIST.
;;;
;; * If NOSELECT is nil then calculate the `size' of the window for each file
;;;   by dividing the `window-height' by length of FILE-LIST.  Thus, `size' is
;;;   cognizant of the window-configuration.
;;;
;; * If `size' is too small abort, otherwise run `find-file' on each element
;;;   of FILE-LIST giving each a window of height `size'.

  "Mark files for which PREDICATE returns non-nil.
With a prefix arg, unmark or unflag those files instead.

PREDICATE is a lisp expression that can refer to the following symbols:

    inode  [integer] the inode of the file (only for ls -i output)
    s      [integer] the size of the file for ls -s output
                     (usually in blocks or, with -k, in KByte)
    mode   [string]  file permission bits, e.g. \"-rw-r--r--\"
    nlink  [integer] number of links to file
    uid    [string]  owner
    gid    [string]  group  (If the gid is not displayed by ls,
                     this will still be set (to the same as uid))
    size   [integer] file size in bytes
    time   [string]  the time that ls displays, e.g. \"Feb 12 14:17\"
    name   [string]  the name of the file
    sym    [string]  if file is a symbolic link, the linked-to name, else \"\"

For example, use

        (equal 0 size)

to mark all zero length files.

There's an ambiguity when a single integer not followed by a unit
prefix precedes the file mode: It is then parsed as inode number
and not as block size (this always works for GNU coreutils ls).

Another limitation is that the uid field is needed for the
function to work correctly.  In particular, the field is not
present for some values of `ls-lisp-emulation'.

This function operates only on the buffer content and does not
refer at all to the underlying file system.  Contrast this with
`find-dired', which might be preferable for the task at hand.
If the region is active in Transient Mark mode, mark files
only in the active region if `dired-mark-region' is non-nil."
