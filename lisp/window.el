  "Bind `standard-output' to BUFFER-OR-NAME, eval BODY, show the buffer.
BUFFER-OR-NAME must specify either a live buffer, or the name of
a buffer (if it does not exist, this macro creates it).

Make the buffer specified by BUFFER-OR-NAME empty before running
BODY and bind `standard-output' to that buffer, so that output
generated with `prin1' and similar functions in BODY goes into
that buffer.  Do not make that buffer current for running the
forms in BODY.  Use `with-current-buffer-window' instead if you
need to run BODY with that buffer current.

At the end of BODY, mark the specified buffer unmodified and
read-only, and display it in a window (but do not select it).
The display happens by calling `display-buffer' passing it the
ACTION argument.  If `temp-buffer-resize-mode' is enabled, the
corresponding window may be resized automatically.

Return the value returned by BODY, unless QUIT-FUNCTION specifies
a function.  In that case, run that function with two arguments -
the window showing the specified buffer and the value returned by
BODY - and return the value returned by that function.

If the buffer is displayed on a new frame, the window manager may
decide to select that frame.  In that case, it's usually a good
strategy if QUIT-FUNCTION selects the window showing the buffer
before reading any value from the minibuffer; for example, when
asking a `yes-or-no-p' question.

This runs the hook `temp-buffer-window-setup-hook' before BODY,
with the specified buffer temporarily current.  It runs the hook
`temp-buffer-window-show-hook' after displaying the buffer, with
that buffer temporarily current, and the window that was used to
display it temporarily selected.

This construct is similar to `with-output-to-temp-buffer' but,
neither runs `temp-buffer-setup-hook' which usually puts the
buffer in Help mode, nor `temp-buffer-show-function' (the ACTION
argument replaces this)."

;; buffer shall be buried or killed and (2) which buffer to show for
;; `switch-to-prev-buffer' and `switch-to-next-buffer'.

;; `prev-buffers' consists of <buffer, window-start, window-point>
;; triples.  The entries on this list are ordered by the time their
;; buffer has been removed from the window, the most recently removed
;; buffer's entry being first.  The window-start and window-point
;; components are `window-start' and `window-point' at the time the
;; buffer was removed from the window which implies that the entry must
;; be added when `set-window-buffer' removes the buffer from the window.

;; `next-buffers' is the list of buffers that have been replaced
;; recently by `switch-to-prev-buffer'.  These buffers are the least
;; preferred candidates of `switch-to-prev-buffer' and the preferred
;; candidates of `switch-to-next-buffer' to switch to.  This list is
;; reset to nil by any action changing the window's buffer with the
;; exception of `switch-to-prev-buffer' and `switch-to-next-buffer'.
;; `switch-to-prev-buffer' pushes the buffer it just replaced on it,
;; `switch-to-next-buffer' pops the last pushed buffer from it.

;; Both `prev-buffers' and `next-buffers' may reference killed buffers
;; if such a buffer was killed while the window was hidden within a
;; window configuration.  Such killed buffers get removed whenever
;; `switch-to-prev-buffer' or `switch-to-next-buffer' encounter them.

the largest or least recently used window.  To change the default
customize the option `split-window-preferred-function'.

You can enforce this function to not split WINDOW horizontally,
by setting (or binding) the variable `split-width-threshold' to
nil.  If, in addition, you set `split-height-threshold' to zero,
chances increase that this function does split WINDOW vertically.

In order to not split WINDOW vertically, set (or bind) the
variable `split-height-threshold' to nil.  Additionally, you can
set `split-width-threshold' to zero to make a horizontal split
more likely to occur.

know how `split-window-sensibly' determines whether WINDOW can be

Optional argument ACTION, if non-nil, should specify a buffer
display action of the form (FUNCTIONS . ALIST).  FUNCTIONS is
either an \"action function\" or a possibly empty list of action
functions.  ALIST is a possibly empty \"action alist\".

An action function is a function that accepts two arguments: the
buffer to display and an action alist.  Based on those arguments,
it should try to display the buffer in a window and return that
window.  An action alist is an association list mapping symbols
to values.  Action functions use the action alist passed to them
to fine-tune their behaviors.

`display-buffer' builds a list of action functions and an action
alist by combining any action functions and alists specified by
`display-buffer-overriding-action', `display-buffer-alist', the
ACTION argument, `display-buffer-base-action', and
`display-buffer-fallback-action' (in order).  Then it calls each
function in the combined function list in turn, passing the
buffer as the first argument and the combined action alist as the
second argument, until one of the functions returns non-nil.

Action functions and the action they try to perform are:
 `display-buffer-same-window' -- Use the selected window.
 `display-buffer-reuse-window' -- Use a window already showing
    the buffer.
 `display-buffer-in-previous-window' -- Use a window that did
    show the buffer before.
 `display-buffer-use-some-window' -- Use some existing window.
 `display-buffer-pop-up-window' -- Pop up a new window.
 `display-buffer-below-selected' -- Use or pop up a window below
    the selected one.
 `display-buffer-at-bottom' -- Use or pop up a window at the
    bottom of the selected frame.
 `display-buffer-pop-up-frame' -- Show the buffer on a new frame.
 `display-buffer-in-child-frame' -- Show the buffer in a
    child frame.
 `display-buffer-no-window' -- Do not display the buffer and
    have `display-buffer' return nil immediately.

Action alist entries are:
 'inhibit-same-window' -- A non-nil value prevents the same
    window from being used for display.
 'inhibit-switch-frame' -- A non-nil value prevents any frame
    used for showing the buffer from being raised or selected.
 'reusable-frames' -- The value specifies the set of frames to
    search for a window that already displays the buffer.
    Possible values are nil (the selected frame), t (any live
    frame), visible (any visible frame), 0 (any visible or
    iconified frame) or an existing live frame.
 'pop-up-frame-parameters' -- The value specifies an alist of
    frame parameters to give a new frame, if one is created.
 'window-height' -- The value specifies the desired height of the
    window chosen and is either an integer (the total height of
    the window), a floating point number (the fraction of its
    total height with respect to the total height of the frame's
    root window) or a function to be called with one argument -
    the chosen window.  The function is supposed to adjust the
    height of the window; its return value is ignored.  Suitable
    functions are `shrink-window-if-larger-than-buffer' and
    `fit-window-to-buffer'.
 'window-width' -- The value specifies the desired width of the
    window chosen and is either an integer (the total width of
    the window), a floating point number (the fraction of its
    total width with respect to the width of the frame's root
    window) or a function to be called with one argument - the
    chosen window.  The function is supposed to adjust the width
    of the window; its return value is ignored.
 'preserve-size' -- The value should be either (t . nil) to
    preserve the width of the chosen window, (nil . t) to
    preserve its height or (t . t) to preserve its height and
    width in future changes of the window configuration.
 'window-parameters' -- The value specifies an alist of window
    parameters to give the chosen window.
 'allow-no-window' -- A non-nil value means that `display-buffer'
    may not display the buffer and return nil immediately.

The entries 'window-height', 'window-width' and 'preserve-size'
are applied only when the window used for displaying the buffer
never showed another buffer before.

The ACTION argument can also have a non-nil and non-list value.
This means to display the buffer in a window other than the
selected one, even if it is already displayed in the selected
window.  If called interactively with a prefix argument, ACTION
is t.  Non-interactive calls should always supply a list or nil.

The optional third argument FRAME, if non-nil, acts like a
\(reusable-frames . FRAME) entry appended to the action alist
specified by the ACTION argument."
