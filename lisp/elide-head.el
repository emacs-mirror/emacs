;;; Commentary:

;; Functionality for eliding boilerplate text (normally copyright
;; notices) in file headers to avoid clutter when you know what it
;; says.
;;
;; `elide-head-headers-to-hide' controls what is elided by the minor
;; mode `elide-head-mode'.  A buffer-local invisible overlay manages
;; the elision.

;; You might add `elide-head-mode' to appropriate major mode hooks or
;; to `find-file-hook'.  Please do not do this in site init files.  If
;; you do, information may be hidden from users who don't know it
;; already.

;; Note that `hs-minor-mode' will do a similar job by default, but
;; it's not selective about what leading commentary it hides.

;; Inspired by jwz's hide-copyleft.el, for which we don't have an
;; assignment.
