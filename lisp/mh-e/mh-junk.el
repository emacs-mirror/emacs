  "Blocklist MSG with SpamAssassin.

SpamAssassin is one of the more popular spam filtering programs.
Get it from your local distribution or from the SpamAssassin web
site at URL `https://spamassassin.apache.org/'.

To use SpamAssassin, add the following recipes to
\".procmailrc\":

    PATH=$PATH:/usr/bin/mh
    MAILDIR=$HOME/`mhparam Path`

    # Fight spam with SpamAssassin.
    :0fw
    | spamc

    # Anything with a spam level of 10 or more is junked immediately.
    :0:
    * ^X-Spam-Level: ..........
    /dev/null

    :0:
    * ^X-Spam-Status: Yes
    spam/.

If you don't use \"spamc\", use \"spamassassin\".

Note that one of the recipes above throws away messages with a
score greater than or equal to 10. Here's how you can determine a
value that works best for you.

First, run \"spamassassin -t\" on every mail message in your
archive and use Gnumeric to verify that the average plus the
standard deviation of good mail is under 5, the SpamAssassin
default for \"spam\".

Using Gnumeric, sort the messages by score and view the messages
with the highest score. Determine the score which encompasses all
of your interesting messages and add a couple of points to be
conservative. Add that many dots to the \"X-Spam-Level:\" header
field above to send messages with that score down the drain.

In the example above, messages with a score of 5-9 are set aside
in the \"+spam\" folder for later review. The major weakness of
rules-based filters is a plethora of false positives so it is
worthwhile to check.

If SpamAssassin classifies a message incorrectly, or is unsure,
you can use the MH-E commands \\[mh-junk-blocklist] and
\\[mh-junk-allowlist].

The command \\[mh-junk-blocklist] adds a \"blacklist_from\" entry
to \"~/spamassassin/user_prefs\", deletes the message, and sends
the message to the Razor, so that others might not see this spam.
If the \"sa-learn\" command is available, the message is also
recategorized as spam.

The command \\[mh-junk-allowlist] adds a \"whitelist_from\" rule
to the \"~/.spamassassin/user_prefs\" file. If the \"sa-learn\"
command is available, the message is also recategorized as ham.

Over time, you'll observe that the same host or domain occurs
repeatedly in the \"blacklist_from\" entries, so you might think
that you could avoid future spam by blocklisting all mail from a
particular domain. The utility function
`mh-spamassassin-identify-spammers' helps you do precisely that.
This function displays a frequency count of the hosts and domains
in the \"blacklist_from\" entries from the last blank line in
\"~/.spamassassin/user_prefs\" to the end of the file. This
information can be used so that you can replace multiple
\"blacklist_from\" entries with a single wildcard entry such as:

    blacklist_from *@*amazingoffersdirect2u.com"

  "Blocklist MSG with bogofilter.

Bogofilter is a Bayesian spam filtering program. Get it from your
local distribution or from the bogofilter web site at URL
`https://bogofilter.sourceforge.io/'.

Bogofilter is taught by running:

    bogofilter -n < good-message

on every good message, and

    bogofilter -s < spam-message

on every spam message. This is called a full training; three other
training methods are described in the FAQ that is distributed with
bogofilter. Note that most Bayesian filters need 1000 to 5000 of each
type of message to start doing a good job.

To use bogofilter, add the following recipes to \".procmailrc\":

    PATH=$PATH:/usr/bin/mh
    MAILDIR=$HOME/`mhparam Path`

    # Fight spam with bogofilter.
    :0fw
    | bogofilter -3 -e -p

    * ^X-Bogosity: Yes, tests=bogofilter
    spam/.

    :0:
    * ^X-Bogosity: Unsure, tests=bogofilter
    spam/unsure/.

If bogofilter classifies a message incorrectly, or is unsure, you can
use the MH-E commands \\[mh-junk-blocklist] and \\[mh-junk-allowlist]
to update bogofilter's training.

The \"Bogofilter FAQ\" suggests that you run the following
occasionally to shrink the database:

    bogoutil -d wordlist.db | bogoutil -l wordlist.db.new
    mv wordlist.db wordlist.db.prv
    mv wordlist.db.new wordlist.db
