;;; Commentary:

;;; Usage:
;;
;; The `C-x C-k e' (`edit-kbd-macro') command edits a keyboard macro
;; in a special buffer.  It prompts you to type a key sequence,
;; which should be one of:
;;
;;  * RET or `C-x e' (call-last-kbd-macro), to edit the most
;;    recently defined keyboard macro.
;;
;;  * `M-x' followed by a command name, to edit a named command
;;    whose definition is a keyboard macro.
;;
;;  * `C-h l' (view-lossage), to edit the 300 most recent keystrokes
;;    and install them as the "current" macro.
;;
;;  * any key sequence whose definition is a keyboard macro.
;;
;; This file includes a version of `insert-kbd-macro' that uses the
;; more readable format defined by these routines.
;;
;; Also, the `read-kbd-macro' command parses the region as
;; a keyboard macro, and installs it as the "current" macro.
;; This and `format-kbd-macro' can also be called directly as
;; Lisp functions.

;; Type `C-h m', or see the documentation for `edmacro-mode' below,
;; for information about the format of written keyboard macros.

;; `edit-kbd-macro' formats the macro with one command per line,
;; including the command names as comments on the right.  If the
;; formatter gets confused about which keymap was used for the
;; characters, the command-name comments will be wrong but that
;; won't hurt anything.

;; With a prefix argument, `edit-kbd-macro' will format the
;; macro in a more concise way that omits the comments.

(require 'seq)
(require 'kmacro)

Press \\[edmacro-insert-key] to insert the name of any key by typing the key.

The editing buffer contains a \"Command:\" line and any number of
\"Key:\" lines at the top.  These are followed by a \"Macro:\" line
and the macro itself as spelled-out keystrokes: `C-x C-f foo RET'.

The \"Command:\" line specifies the command name to which the macro
is bound, or \"none\" for no command name.  Write \"last-kbd-macro\"
to refer to the current keyboard macro (as used by \\[call-last-kbd-macro]).

The \"Key:\" lines specify key sequences to which the macro is bound,
or \"none\" for no key bindings.

You can edit these lines to change the places where the new macro
is stored.


Format of keyboard macros during editing:

Text is divided into \"words\" separated by whitespace.  Except for
the words described below, the characters of each word go directly
as characters of the macro.  The whitespace that separates words
is ignored.  Whitespace in the macro must be written explicitly,
as in \"foo SPC bar RET\".

 * The special words RET, SPC, TAB, DEL, LFD, ESC, and NUL represent
   special control characters.  The words must be written in uppercase.

 * A word in angle brackets, e.g., <return>, <down>, or <f1>, represents
   a function key.  (Note that in the standard configuration, the
   function key <return> and the control key RET are synonymous.)
   You can use angle brackets on the words RET, SPC, etc., but they
   are not required there.

 * Keys can be written by their ASCII code, using a backslash followed
   by up to six octal digits.  This is the only way to represent keys
   with codes above \\377.

 * One or more prefixes M- (meta), C- (control), S- (shift), A- (alt),
   H- (hyper), and s- (super) may precede a character or key notation.
   For function keys, the prefixes may go inside or outside of the
   brackets:  C-<down> = <C-down>.  The prefixes may be written in
   any order:  M-C-x = C-M-x.

   Prefixes are not allowed on multi-key words, e.g., C-abc, except
   that the Meta prefix is allowed on a sequence of digits and optional
   minus sign:  M--123 = M-- M-1 M-2 M-3.

 * The `^' notation for control characters also works:  ^M = C-m.

 * Double angle brackets enclose command names:  <<next-line>> is
   shorthand for M-x next-line RET.

 * Finally, REM or ;; causes the rest of the line to be ignored as a
   comment.

Any word may be prefixed by a multiplier in the form of a decimal
number and `*':  3*<right> = <right> <right> <right>, and
10*foo = foofoofoofoofoofoofoofoofoofoo.

Multiple text keys can normally be strung together to form a word,
but you may need to add whitespace if the word would look like one
of the above notations:  `; ; ;' is a keyboard macro with three
semicolons, but `;;;' is a comment.  Likewise, `\\ 1 2 3' is four
keys but `\\123' is a single key written in octal, and `< right >'
is seven keys but `<right>' is a single function key.  When in
doubt, use whitespace."
