A prefix ARG specifies how many error messages to move;
negative means move back to previous error messages.
Just \\[universal-argument] as a prefix means reparse the error message buffer
and start at the first error.

The RESET argument specifies that we should restart from the beginning.

\\[next-error] normally uses the most recently started
compilation, grep, or occur buffer.  It can also operate on any
buffer with output from the \\[compile], \\[grep] commands, or,
more generally, on any buffer in Compilation mode or with
Compilation Minor mode enabled, or any buffer in which
`next-error-function' is bound to an appropriate function.
To specify use of a particular buffer for error messages, type
\\[next-error] in that buffer.  You can also use the command
`next-error-select-buffer' to select the buffer to use for the subsequent
invocation of `next-error'.

Once \\[next-error] has chosen the buffer for error messages, it
runs `next-error-hook' with `run-hooks', and stays with that buffer
until you use it in some other buffer which uses Compilation mode
or Compilation Minor mode.

;; The positions given in elements of the undo list are the positions

;;
;; Undo in region is a use case that requires adjustments to undo
;; elements.  It must adjust positions of elements in the region based
;; on newer elements not in the region so as they may be correctly
;; applied in the current buffer.  undo-make-selective-list
;; accomplishes this with its undo-deltas list of adjustments.  An

;;  |   |<-- region: "caab", from 2 to 6
;;
;; When the user starts a run of undos in region,
;; undo-make-selective-list is called to create the full list of in
;; region elements.  Each element is adjusted forward chronologically
;; through undo-deltas to determine if it is in the region.
;;
;; In the above example, the insertion of "b" is (3 . 4) in the
;; buffer-undo-list.  The undo-delta (1 . -2) causes (3 . 4) to become
;; (5 . 6).  The next three undo-deltas cause no adjustment, so (5
;; . 6) is assessed as in the region and placed in the selective list.
;; Notably, the end of region itself adjusts from "2 to 6" to "2 to 5"
;; due to the selected element.  The "b" insertion is the only element
;; fully in the region, so in this example undo-make-selective-list
;; returns (nil (5 . 6)).
;;
;; The adjustment of the (7 . 10) insertion of "ddd" shows an edge
;; case.  It is adjusted through the undo-deltas: ((6 . 2) (6 . -2)).
;; Normally an undo-delta of (6 . 2) would cause positions after 6 to
;; adjust by 2.  However, they shouldn't adjust to less than 6, so (7
;; . 10) adjusts to (6 . 8) due to the first undo delta.
;;
;; More interesting is how to adjust the "ddd" insertion due to the
;; next undo-delta: (6 . -2), corresponding to reinsertion of "ad".
;; If the reinsertion was a manual retyping of "ad", then the total
;; adjustment should be (7 . 10) -> (6 . 8) -> (8 . 10).  However, if
;; the reinsertion was due to undo, one might expect the first "d"
;; character would again be a part of the "ddd" text, meaning its
;; total adjustment would be (7 . 10) -> (6 . 8) -> (7 . 10).
;;
;; undo-make-selective-list assumes in this situation that "ad" was a
;; new edit, even if it was inserted because of an undo.
;; Consequently, if the user undos in region "8 to 10" of the
;; "ccaabaddd" buffer, they could be surprised that it becomes
;; "ccaabad", as though the first "d" became detached from the
;; original "ddd" insertion.  This quirk is a FIXME.

If COMMAND ends in `&', execute it asynchronously.
The output appears in the buffer `*Async Shell Command*'.
That buffer is in shell mode.  You can also use
`async-shell-command' that automatically adds `&'.

Otherwise, COMMAND is executed synchronously.  The output appears in
the buffer `*Shell Command Output*'.  If the output is short enough to
display in the echo area (which is determined by the variables
`resize-mini-windows' and `max-mini-window-height'), it is shown
there, but it is nonetheless available in buffer `*Shell Command
Output*' even though that buffer is not automatically displayed.

To specify a coding system for converting non-ASCII characters
in the shell command output, use \\[universal-coding-system-argument] \
before this command.

Noninteractive callers can specify coding systems by binding
`coding-system-for-read' and `coding-system-for-write'.

The optional second argument OUTPUT-BUFFER, if non-nil,
says to put the output in some other buffer.
If OUTPUT-BUFFER is a buffer or buffer name, erase that buffer
and insert the output there; a non-nil value of
`shell-command-dont-erase-buffer' prevents the buffer from being
erased.  If OUTPUT-BUFFER is not a buffer and not nil, insert the
output in current buffer after point leaving mark after it.  This
cannot be done asynchronously.

If the command terminates without error, but generates output,
and you did not specify \"insert it in the current buffer\",
the output can be displayed in the echo area or in its buffer.
If the output is short enough to display in the echo area
\(determined by the variable `max-mini-window-height' if
`resize-mini-windows' is non-nil), it is shown there.
Otherwise, the buffer containing the output is displayed.

If there is output and an error, and you did not specify \"insert it
in the current buffer\", a message about the error goes at the end
of the output.

If the optional third argument ERROR-BUFFER is non-nil, it is a buffer
or buffer name to which to direct the command's standard error output.
If it is nil, error output is mingled with regular output.
In an interactive call, the variable `shell-command-default-error-buffer'
specifies the value of ERROR-BUFFER.

  "Execute string COMMAND in inferior shell with region as input.
Normally display output (if any) in temp buffer `*Shell Command Output*';
Prefix arg means replace the region with it.  Return the exit code of
COMMAND.

To specify a coding system for converting non-ASCII characters
in the input and output to the shell command, use \\[universal-coding-system-argument]
before this command.  By default, the input (from the current buffer)
is encoded using coding-system specified by `process-coding-system-alist',
falling back to `default-process-coding-system' if no match for COMMAND
is found in `process-coding-system-alist'.

Noninteractive callers can specify coding systems by binding
`coding-system-for-read' and `coding-system-for-write'.

If the command generates output, the output may be displayed
in the echo area or in a buffer.
If the output is short enough to display in the echo area
\(determined by the variable `max-mini-window-height' if
`resize-mini-windows' is non-nil), it is shown there.
Otherwise it is displayed in the buffer `*Shell Command Output*'.
The output is available in that buffer in both cases.

If there is output and an error, a message about the error
appears at the end of the output.

Optional fourth arg OUTPUT-BUFFER specifies where to put the
command's output.  If the value is a buffer or buffer name,
erase that buffer and insert the output there; a non-nil value of
`shell-command-dont-erase-buffer' prevent to erase the buffer.
If the value is nil, use the buffer `*Shell Command Output*'.
Any other non-nil value means to insert the output in the
current buffer after START.

Optional fifth arg REPLACE, if non-nil, means to insert the
output in place of text from START to END, putting point and mark
around it.

Optional sixth arg ERROR-BUFFER, if non-nil, specifies a buffer
or buffer name to which to direct the command's standard error
output.  If nil, error output is mingled with regular output.
When called interactively, `shell-command-default-error-buffer'
is used for ERROR-BUFFER.

Optional seventh arg DISPLAY-ERROR-BUFFER, if non-nil, means to
display the error buffer if there were any errors.  When called

This variable holds a function that Emacs calls to obtain text
that other programs have provided for pasting.  The function is
called with no arguments.  If no other program has provided text

The function may also return a list of strings if the window
system supports multiple selections.  The first string will be
used as the pasted text, but the other will be placed in the kill
ring for easy access via `yank-pop'.

Note that the function should return a string only if a program
other than Emacs has provided a string for pasting; if Emacs
provided the most recent string, the function should return nil.
If it is difficult to tell whether Emacs or some other program

normal insert behavior is altered, and instead, for each contiguous
segment of STRING that has a given value of the `yank-handler'

elements, of the form (FUNCTION PARAM NOEXCLUDE UNDO).
FUNCTION, if non-nil, should be a function of one argument (the
 object to insert); FUNCTION is called instead of `insert'.
PARAM, if present and non-nil, is passed to FUNCTION (to be handled
 in whatever way is appropriate; e.g. if FUNCTION is `yank-rectangle',
 PARAM may be a list of strings to insert as a rectangle).  If PARAM
 is nil, then the current segment of STRING is used.
If NOEXCLUDE is present and non-nil, the normal removal of
 `yank-excluded-properties' is not performed; instead FUNCTION is
 responsible for the removal.  This may be necessary if FUNCTION
 adjusts point before or after inserting the object.
UNDO, if present and non-nil, should be a function to be called
 by `yank-pop' to undo the insertion of the current PARAM.  It is
 given two arguments, the start and end of the region.  FUNCTION
 may set `yank-undo-function' to override UNDO.

Transient Mark mode is a global minor mode.  When enabled, the
region is highlighted with the `region' face whenever the mark

of their usual default part of the buffer's text.  Examples of
such commands include \\[comment-dwim], \\[flush-lines], \\[keep-lines],
\\[query-replace], \\[query-replace-regexp], \\[ispell], and \\[undo].

  "Set the default behavior of the Delete and Backspace keys.

If set to t, Delete key deletes forward and Backspace key deletes
backward.

If set to nil, both Delete and Backspace keys delete backward.

If set to `maybe' (which is the default), Emacs automatically
selects a behavior.  On window systems, the behavior depends on
the keyboard used.  If the keyboard has both a Backspace key and
a Delete key, and both are mapped to their usual meanings, the
option's default value is set to t, so that Backspace can be used
to delete backward, and Delete can be used to delete forward.

If not running under a window system, customizing this option
accomplishes a similar effect by mapping C-h, which is usually
generated by the Backspace key, to DEL, and by mapping DEL to C-d
via `keyboard-translate'.  The former functionality of C-h is
available on the F1 key.  You should probably not use this
setting if you don't have both Backspace, Delete and F1 keys.

Setting this variable with setq doesn't take effect.  Programmatically,

With a prefix argument ARG, enable this feature if ARG is

the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.

On window systems, when this mode is on, Delete is mapped to C-d
and Backspace is mapped to DEL; when this mode is off, both
Delete and Backspace are mapped to DEL.  (The remapping goes via
`local-function-key-map', so binding Delete or Backspace in the
global or local keymap will override that.)

In addition, on window systems, the bindings of C-Delete, M-Delete,
C-M-Delete, C-Backspace, M-Backspace, and C-M-Backspace are changed in
the global keymap in accordance with the functionality of Delete and
Backspace.  For example, if Delete is remapped to C-d, which deletes
forward, C-Delete is bound to `kill-word', but if Delete is remapped
to DEL, which deletes backward, C-Delete is bound to
`backward-kill-word'.

If not running on a window system, a similar effect is accomplished by
remapping C-h (normally produced by the Backspace key) and DEL via
`keyboard-translate': if this mode is on, C-h is mapped to DEL and DEL
to C-d; if it's off, the keys are not remapped.

When not running on a window system, and this mode is turned on, the
former functionality of C-h is available on the F1 key.  You should
probably not turn on this mode on a text-only terminal if you don't
