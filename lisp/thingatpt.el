;;; Commentary:

;; This file provides routines for getting the "thing" at the location of
;; point, whatever that "thing" happens to be.  The "thing" is defined by
;; its beginning and end positions in the buffer.
;;
;; The function bounds-of-thing-at-point finds the beginning and end
;; positions by moving first forward to the end of the "thing", and then
;; backwards to the beginning.  By default, it uses the corresponding
;; forward-"thing" operator (eg. forward-word, forward-line).
;;
;; Special cases are allowed for using properties associated with the named
;; "thing":
;;
;;   forward-op		Function to call to skip forward over a "thing" (or
;;                      with a negative argument, backward).
;;
;;   beginning-op	Function to call to skip to the beginning of a "thing".
;;   end-op		Function to call to skip to the end of a "thing".
;;
;; For simple things, defined as sequences of specific kinds of characters,
;; use macro define-thing-chars.
;;
;; Reliance on existing operators means that many `things' can be accessed
;; without further code:  eg.
;;     (thing-at-point 'line)
;;     (thing-at-point 'page)
