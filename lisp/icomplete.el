;;; Commentary:

;; Enabling this package implements a more fine-grained minibuffer
;; completion feedback scheme.  Prospective completions are concisely
;; indicated within the minibuffer itself, with each successive
;; keystroke.

;; See `icomplete-completions' docstring for a description of the
;; icomplete display format.

;; See the `icomplete-minibuffer-setup-hook' docstring for a means to
;; customize icomplete setup for interoperation with other
;; minibuffer-oriented packages.

;; To enable/disable icomplete mode, use the `icomplete-mode' function.

;; Thanks to everyone for their suggestions for refinements of this
;; package.  I particularly have to credit Michael Cook, who
;; implemented an incremental completion style in his 'iswitch'
;; functions that served as a model for icomplete.  Some other
;; contributors: Noah Friedman (restructuring as minor mode), Colin
;; Rafferty (lemacs reconciliation), Lars Lindberg, RMS, and others.

  "Identify prospective candidates for minibuffer completion.

The display is updated with each minibuffer keystroke during
minibuffer completion.

Prospective completion suffixes (if any) are displayed, bracketed by
one of (), [], or {} pairs.  The choice of brackets is as follows:

  (...) - a single prospect is identified and matching is enforced,
  [...] - a single prospect is identified but matching is optional, or
  {...} - multiple prospects, separated by commas, are indicated, and
          further input is required to distinguish a single one.

If there are multiple possibilities, `icomplete-separator' separates them.

The displays for unambiguous matches have ` [Matched]' appended
\(whether complete or not), or ` [No matches]', if no eligible
matches exist."
