;;; Commentary:

;; Enabling this package implements a more fine-grained minibuffer
;; completion feedback scheme.  Prospective completions are concisely
;; indicated within the minibuffer itself, with each successive
;; keystroke.

;; See `icomplete-completions' docstring for a description of the
;; icomplete display format.

;; See the `icomplete-minibuffer-setup-hook' docstring for a means to
;; customize icomplete setup for interoperation with other
;; minibuffer-oriented packages.

;; To enable/disable icomplete mode, use the `icomplete-mode' function.

;; Thanks to everyone for their suggestions for refinements of this
;; package.  I particularly have to credit Michael Cook, who
;; implemented an incremental completion style in his 'iswitch'
;; functions that served as a model for icomplete.  Some other
;; contributors: Noah Friedman (restructuring as minor mode), Colin
;; Rafferty (lemacs reconciliation), Lars Lindberg, RMS, and others.
