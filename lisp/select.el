;;; Commentary:

;; Based partially on earlier release by Lucid.

;; The functionality here is divided in two parts:
;; - Low-level: gui-get-selection, gui-set-selection, gui-selection-owner-p,
;;   gui-selection-exists-p are the backend-dependent functions meant to access
;;   various kinds of selections (CLIPBOARD, PRIMARY, SECONDARY).
;; - Higher-level: gui-select-text and gui-selection-value go together to
;;   access the general notion of "GUI selection" for interoperation with other
;;   applications.  This can use either the clipboard or the primary selection,
;;   or both or none according to select-enable-clipboard/primary.  These are
;;   the default values of interprogram-cut/paste-function.
;;   Additionally, there's gui-get-primary-selection which is used to get the
;;   PRIMARY selection, specifically for mouse-yank-primary.

;;; Code:

(defcustom selection-coding-system nil
  "Coding system for communicating with other programs.

When sending or receiving text via selection and clipboard, the text
is encoded or decoded by this coding system.  The default value is
the current system default encoding on 9x/Me, `utf-16le-dos'
\(Unicode) on NT/W2K/XP, and `iso-latin-1-dos' on MS-DOS.

For X Windows:
When sending text via selection and clipboard, if the target
data-type matches with the type of this coding system, it is used
for encoding the text.  Otherwise (including the case that this
variable is nil), a proper coding system is used as below:

data-type	coding system
---------	-------------
UTF8_STRING	utf-8
COMPOUND_TEXT	compound-text-with-extensions
STRING		iso-latin-1
C_STRING	no-conversion

When receiving text, if this coding system is non-nil, it is used
for decoding regardless of the data-type.  If this is nil, a
proper coding system is used according to the data-type as above.
