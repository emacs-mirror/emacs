## Comments on loaddefs generation:

# loaddefs depends on gen-lisp because in ../src, the emacs target
# depends on loaddefs, but not on, for instance, leim-list.  So having
# leim as a dependency of loaddefs (via gen-lisp) ensures leim-list
# gets created before the final emacs is dumped.  Having leim
# dependencies in ../src as well would create a parallel race
# condition.
#
# FIXME: Is the following true any more?
#
# We'd really like to add "make -C ../admin/unidata all" to gen-lisp,
# but it causes a race condition in parallel builds because ../src
# also runs that rule.  Given the limitations of recursive make, the
# only way to fix that would be to remove unidata from ../src rules,
# but that doesn't seem possible due to the various non-trivial
# dependencies.

# The real dependencies of loaddefs.el aren't known to Make, they are
# implemented in loaddefs-generate--emacs-batch, so autoloads is an
# "all" dependency.  "leim" isn't really a dependency here, but we
# need leim-list.el at about the same time, so ensure that it's
# generated, too.
