;;; Commentary:
;;    This library provides an interface to the mailabbrev package as
;;    an EUDC data source.

;;; Usage:
;;    No setup is required, since there is an entry for this backend
;;    in `eudc-server-hotlist' by default.
;;
;;    For example, if your `mail-personal-alias-file' (typically
;;    ~/.mailrc) contains:
;;
;;    alias lars "Lars <larsi@mail-abbrev.com>"
;;
;;    Then:
;;
;;    C-x m lars C-u M-x eudc-expand-try-all RET
;;
;;    will expand the correct email address into the To: field of the
;;    new message.

  "Query `mailabbrev' with QUERY.
QUERY is a list of cons cells (ATTR . VALUE).  Since `mailabbrev'
does not provide attributes in the usual sense, only the email,
name, and firstname attributes in the QUERY are considered, and
their values are matched against the alias names in the mailrc
file.  When a mailrc alias is a distribution list, that is it
expands to more that one email address, the individual recipient
specifications are formatted using `eudc-rfc5322-make-address',
and returned as a comma-separated list in the email address
attribute.

RETURN-ATTRS is a list of attributes to return, defaulting to
`eudc-default-return-attributes'."
