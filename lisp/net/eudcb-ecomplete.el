;;; Commentary:
;;    This library provides an interface to the ecomplete package as
;;    an EUDC data source.

;;; Usage:
;;    No setup is required, since there is an entry for this backend
;;    in `eudc-server-hotlist' by default.
;;
;;    For example, if your `ecomplete-database-file' (typically
;;    ~/.emacs.d/ecompleterc) contains:
;;
;;    ((mail ("larsi@gnus.org" 38154 1516109510 "Lars <larsi@ecomplete.org>")))
;;
;;    Then:
;;
;;    C-x m lars C-u M-x eudc-expand-try-all RET
;;
;;    should expand the email address into the To: field of the new
;;    message.

;;; Code:

(require 'eudc)
(require 'ecomplete)
(require 'mail-parse)

(defvar eudc-ecomplete-attributes-translation-alist
  '((email     . mail))
  "See `eudc-protocol-attributes-translation-alist'.
The back-end-specific attribute names are used as the \"type\" of
entry when searching, and they must hence match the types you use
in your ecompleterc database file.")
