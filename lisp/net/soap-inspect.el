;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This package provides an inspector for a WSDL document loaded with
;; `soap-load-wsdl' or `soap-load-wsdl-from-url'.  To use it, evaluate:
;;
;; (soap-inspect *wsdl*)
;;
;; This will pop-up the inspector buffer.  You can click on ports, operations
;; and types to explore the structure of the wsdl document.
