allows an attacker with sufficient resource, and positioned

The Logjam paper suggests using 1024-bit prime on the client to
mitigate some effects of this attack, and upgrade to 2048-bit as
soon as server configurations allow.  According to SSLLabs' SSL
Pulse tracker, only about 75% of server support 2048-bit key
