  "Replace in all buffers the visiting file name from SOURCE to TARGET.
SOURCE is a remote directory name, which could contain also a
localname part.  TARGET is the directory name SOURCE is replaced
with.  Often, TARGET is a remote directory name on another host,
but it can also be a local directory name.  If TARGET has no
local part, the local part from SOURCE is used.

If TARGET is nil, it is selected according to the first match in
`tramp-default-rename-alist'.  If called interactively, this
match is offered as initial value for selection.

On all buffers, which have a `buffer-file-name' matching SOURCE,
this name is modified by replacing SOURCE with TARGET.  This is
applied by calling `set-visited-file-name'.  The new
`buffer-file-name' is prompted for modification in the
minibuffer.  The buffers are marked modified, and must be saved
explicitly.

If user option `tramp-confirm-rename-file-names' is nil, changing
the file name happens without confirmation.  This requires a
matching entry in `tramp-default-rename-alist'.

Remote buffers related to the remote connection identified by
SOURCE, which are not visiting files, or which are visiting files
not matching SOURCE, are not modified.

Interactively, TARGET is selected from `tramp-default-rename-alist'
without confirmation if the prefix argument is non-nil.

The remote connection identified by SOURCE is flushed by
`tramp-cleanup-connection'."

Enter your bug report in this message, including as much detail
as you possibly can about the problem, what you did to cause it
and what the local and remote machines are.

If you can give a simple set of instructions to make this bug
happen reliably, please include those.  Thank you for helping
kill bugs in Tramp.

Before reproducing the bug, you might apply

  M-x tramp-cleanup-all-connections

This allows us to investigate from a clean environment.  Another
useful thing to do is to put

  (setq tramp-verbose 9)

in your init file and to repeat the bug.  Then, include the
contents of the *tramp/foo* buffer and the *debug tramp/foo*
buffer in your bug report.
