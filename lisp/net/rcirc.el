;;; Commentary:

;; Internet Relay Chat (IRC) is a form of instant communication over
;; the Internet.  It is mainly designed for group (many-to-many)
;; communication in discussion forums called channels, but also allows
;; one-to-one communication.

;; Rcirc has simple defaults and clear and consistent behavior.
;; Message arrival timestamps, activity notification on the mode line,
;; message filling, nick completion, and keepalive pings are all
;; enabled by default, but can easily be adjusted or turned off.  Each
;; discussion takes place in its own buffer and there is a single
;; server buffer per connection.

;; Open a new irc connection with:
;; M-x irc RET

SERVER-NAME is a string describing the server to connect
to.

The optional PARAMETERS come in pairs PARAMETER VALUE.

The following parameters are recognized:

`:nick'

VALUE must be a string.  If absent, `rcirc-default-nick' is used
for this connection.

`:port'

VALUE must be a number or string.  If absent,
`rcirc-default-port' is used.

`:user-name'

VALUE must be a string.  If absent, `rcirc-default-user-name' is
used.

`:password'

VALUE must be a string.  If absent, no PASS command will be sent
to the server.

`:full-name'

VALUE must be a string.  If absent, `rcirc-default-full-name' is
used.

`:channels'

VALUE must be a list of strings describing which channels to join
when connecting to this server.  If absent, no channels will be
connected to automatically.

`:encryption'

VALUE must be `plain' (the default) for unencrypted connections, or `tls'
for connections using SSL/TLS.

`:server-alias'

VALUE must be a string that will be used instead of the server
name for display purposes.  If absent, the real server name will
be displayed instead."
