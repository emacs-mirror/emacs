;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides remote file editing, similar to ange-ftp.
;; The difference is that ange-ftp uses FTP to transfer files between
;; the local and the remote host, whereas tramp.el uses a combination
;; of rsh and rcp or other work-alike programs, such as ssh/scp.
;;
;; For more detailed instructions, please see the info file.

(defvar tramp-methods nil
  "Alist of methods for remote files.
This is a list of entries of the form (NAME PARAM1 PARAM2 ...).
Each NAME stands for a remote access method.  Each PARAM is a
pair of the form (KEY VALUE).  The following KEYs are defined:
  * `tramp-remote-shell'
    This specifies the shell to use on the remote host.  This
    MUST be a Bourne-like shell.  It is normally not necessary to
    set this to any value other than \"/bin/sh\": Tramp wants to
    use a shell which groks tilde expansion, but it can search
    for it.  Also note that \"/bin/sh\" exists on all Unixen,
    this might not be true for the value that you decide to use.
    You Have Been Warned.
  * `tramp-remote-shell-login'
    This specifies the arguments to let `tramp-remote-shell' run
    as a login shell.  It defaults to (\"-l\"), but some shells,
    like ksh, require another argument.  See
    `tramp-connection-properties' for a way to overwrite the
    default value.
  * `tramp-remote-shell-args'
    For implementation of `shell-command', this specifies the
    arguments to let `tramp-remote-shell' run a single command.
  * `tramp-login-program'
    This specifies the name of the program to use for logging in to the
    remote host.  This may be the name of rsh or a workalike program,
    or the name of telnet or a workalike, or the name of su or a workalike.
  * `tramp-login-args'
    This specifies the list of arguments to pass to the above
    mentioned program.  Please note that this is a list of list of arguments,
    that is, normally you don't want to put \"-a -b\" or \"-f foo\"
    here.  Instead, you want a list (\"-a\" \"-b\"), or (\"-f\" \"foo\").
    There are some patterns: \"%h\" in this list is replaced by the host
    name, \"%u\" is replaced by the user name, \"%p\" is replaced by the
    port number, and \"%%\" can be used to obtain a literal percent character.
    If a list containing \"%h\", \"%u\" or \"%p\" is unchanged during
    expansion (i.e. no host or no user specified), this list is not used as
    argument.  By this, arguments like (\"-l\" \"%u\") are optional.
    \"%t\" is replaced by the temporary file name produced with
    `tramp-make-tramp-temp-file'.  \"%k\" indicates the keep-date
    parameter of a program, if exists.  \"%c\" adds additional
    `tramp-ssh-controlmaster-options' options for the first hop.
  * `tramp-login-env'
     A list of environment variables and their values, which will
     be set when calling `tramp-login-program'.
  * `tramp-async-args'
    When an asynchronous process is started, we know already that
    the connection works.  Therefore, we can pass additional
    parameters to suppress diagnostic messages, in order not to
    tamper the process output.
  * `tramp-copy-program'
    This specifies the name of the program to use for remotely copying
    the file; this might be the absolute filename of scp or the name of
    a workalike program.  It is always applied on the local host.
  * `tramp-copy-args'
    This specifies the list of parameters to pass to the above mentioned
    program, the hints for `tramp-login-args' also apply here.
  * `tramp-copy-env'
     A list of environment variables and their values, which will
     be set when calling `tramp-copy-program'.
  * `tramp-remote-copy-program'
    The listener program to be applied on remote side, if needed.
  * `tramp-remote-copy-args'
    The list of parameters to pass to the listener program, the hints
    for `tramp-login-args' also apply here.  Additionally, \"%r\" could
    be used here and in `tramp-copy-args'.  It denotes a randomly
    chosen port for the remote listener.
  * `tramp-copy-keep-date'
    This specifies whether the copying program when the preserves the
    timestamp of the original file.
  * `tramp-copy-keep-tmpfile'
    This specifies whether a temporary local file shall be kept
    for optimization reasons (useful for \"rsync\" methods).
  * `tramp-copy-recursive'
    Whether the operation copies directories recursively.
  * `tramp-default-port'
    The default port of a method.
  * `tramp-tmpdir'
    A directory on the remote host for temporary files.  If not
    specified, \"/tmp\" is taken as default.
  * `tramp-connection-timeout'
    This is the maximum time to be spent for establishing a connection.
    In general, the global default value shall be used, but for
    some methods, like \"su\" or \"sudo\", a shorter timeout
    might be desirable.
  * `tramp-case-insensitive'
    Whether the remote file system handles file names case insensitive.
    Only a non-nil value counts, the default value nil means to
    perform further checks on the remote host.  See
    `tramp-connection-properties' for a way to overwrite this.

What does all this mean?  Well, you should specify `tramp-login-program'
for all methods; this program is used to log in to the remote site.  Then,
there are two ways to actually transfer the files between the local and the
remote side.  One way is using an additional scp-like program.  If you want
to do this, set `tramp-copy-program' in the method.

Another possibility for file transfer is inline transfer, i.e. the
file is passed through the same buffer used by `tramp-login-program'.  In
this case, the file contents need to be protected since the
`tramp-login-program' might use escape codes or the connection might not
be eight-bit clean.  Therefore, file contents are encoded for transit.
See the variables `tramp-local-coding-commands' and
`tramp-remote-coding-commands' for details.

So, to summarize: if the method is an out-of-band method, then you
must specify `tramp-copy-program' and `tramp-copy-args'.  If it is an
inline method, then these two parameters should be nil.

Notes:

When using `su' or `sudo' the phrase \"open connection to a remote
host\" sounds strange, but it is used nevertheless, for consistency.
No connection is opened to a remote host, but `su' or `sudo' is
started on the local host.  You should specify a remote host
`localhost' or the name of the local host.  Another host name is
useful only in combination with `tramp-default-proxies-alist'.")

It is necessary only on systems which have a buggy `process-send-string'

            (process-send-string proc (make-string sent ?\\ ))
            (process-send-eof proc)

          (while (not (progn (goto-char (point-min))

        (message \"Test does not work\")
        (display-buffer (current-buffer))
        (sit-for 30))))

In the Emacs normally running Tramp, evaluate the above code
\(replace \"xxx\" and \"yyy\" by the remote user and host name,
respectively).  You can do this, for example, by pasting it into
the `*scratch*' buffer and then hitting C-j with the cursor after the
last closing parenthesis.  Note that it works only if you have configured
\"ssh\" to run without password query, see ssh-agent(1).

You will see the number of bytes sent successfully to the remote host.
If that number exceeds 1000, you can stop the execution by hitting
C-g, because your Emacs is likely clean.

When it is necessary to set `tramp-chunksize', you might consider to
use an out-of-the-band method \(like \"scp\") instead of an internal one
\(like \"ssh\"), because setting `tramp-chunksize' to non-nil decreases
performance.

If your Emacs is buggy, the code stops and gives you an indication
about the value `tramp-chunksize' should be set.  Maybe you could just
experiment a bit, e.g. changing the values of `init' and `step'
in the third line of the code.

Please raise a bug report via \"M-x tramp-bug\" if your system needs
this variable to be set as well."

;; Currently (as of Emacs 20.5), the function `shell-quote-argument'
;; does not deal well with newline characters.  Newline is replaced by
;; backslash newline.  But if, say, the string `a backslash newline b'
;; is passed to a shell, the shell will expand this into "ab",
;; completely omitting the newline.  This is not what was intended.
;; It does not appear to be possible to make the function
;; `shell-quote-argument' work with newlines without making it
;; dependent on the shell used.  But within this package, we know that
;; we will always use a Bourne-like shell, so we use an approach which
;; groks newlines.
;;
;; The approach is simple: we call `shell-quote-argument', then
;; massage the newline part of the result.
;;
;; This function should produce a string which is grokked by a Unix
;; shell, even if the Emacs is running on Windows.  Since this is the
;; kludges section, we bind `system-type' in such a way that
;; `shell-quote-argument' behaves as if on Unix.
;;
;; Thanks to Mario DeWeerd for the hint that it is sufficient for this
;; function to work with Bourne-like shells.

;; * Better error checking.  At least whenever we see something

;; * Make shadowfile.el grok Tramp filenames.  (Bug#4526, Bug#4846)
;;
;; * I was wondering if it would be possible to use tramp even if I'm
;;   actually using sshfs.  But when I launch a command I would like
;;   to get it executed on the remote machine where the files really
;;   are.  (Andrea Crotti)

;; * Run emerge on two remote files.  Bug is described here:
;;   <https://www.mail-archive.com/tramp-devel@nongnu.org/msg01041.html>.
;;   (Bug#6850)
;;
;; * Refactor code from different handlers.  Start with
;;   *-process-file.  One idea is to generalize `tramp-send-command'
;;   and friends, for most of the handlers this is the major
;;   difference between the different backends.  Other handlers but
;;   *-process-file would profit from this as well.
