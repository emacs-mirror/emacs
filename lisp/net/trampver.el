;;; Commentary:

;; Convenience functions around the Tramp version. Partly generated
;; during Tramp configuration.

;;; Code:

;; In the Tramp GIT, the version number is auto-frobbed from tramp.el,
;; and the bug report address is auto-frobbed from configure.ac.
;; Emacs version check is defined in macro AC_EMACS_INFO of
;; aclocal.m4; should be changed only there.
