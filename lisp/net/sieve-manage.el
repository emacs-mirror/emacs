;;; Commentary:

;; This library provides an elisp API for the managesieve network
;; protocol.
;;
;; It uses the SASL library for authentication, which means it
;; supports DIGEST-MD5, CRAM-MD5, SCRAM-MD5, NTLM, PLAIN and LOGIN
;; methods.  STARTTLS is not well tested, but should be easy to get to
;; work if someone wants.
;;
;; The API should be fairly obvious for anyone familiar with the
;; managesieve protocol, interface functions include:
;;
;; `sieve-manage-open'
;; open connection to managesieve server, returning a buffer to be
;; used by all other API functions.
;;
;; `sieve-manage-opened'
;; check if a server is open or not
;;
;; `sieve-manage-close'
;; close a server connection.
;;
;; `sieve-manage-listscripts'
;; `sieve-manage-deletescript'
;; `sieve-manage-getscript'
;; performs managesieve protocol actions
;;
;; and that's it.  Example of a managesieve session in *scratch*:
;;
;; (with-current-buffer (sieve-manage-open "mail.example.com")
;;   (sieve-manage-authenticate)
;;   (sieve-manage-listscripts))
;;
;; => ((active . "main") "vacation")

;;
;; Release history:
;;
;; 2001-10-31 Committed to Oort Gnus.
;; 2002-07-27 Added DELETESCRIPT.  Suggested by Ned Ludd.
;; 2002-08-03 Use SASL library.
;; 2013-06-05 Enabled STARTTLS support, fixed bit rot.
