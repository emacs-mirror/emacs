;;; Commentary:

;; rclone is a command line program to sync files and directories to
;; and from cloud storages.  Tramp uses its mount utility to access
;; files and directories there.  The configuration of rclone for
;; different storage systems is performed outside Tramp, see rclone(1).

;; A remote file under rclone control has the form
;; "/rclone:<remote>:/path/to/file".  <remote> is the name of a
;; storage system in rclone's configuration.  Therefore, such a remote
;; file name does not know of any user or port specification.
