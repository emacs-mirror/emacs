;;; Commentary:
;;    This library provides an interface to the macOS Contacts app as
;;    an EUDC data source.  It uses AppleScript to interface with the
;;    Contacts app on localhost, so no 3rd party tools are needed.

;;; Usage:
;;    To load the library, first `require' it:
;;
;;      (require 'eudcb-macos-contacts)
;;
;;    In the simplest case then just use:
;;
;;      (eudc-macos-contacts-set-server "localhost")
;;
;;    When using `eudc-server-hotlist', instead use:
;;
;;      (add-to-list 'eudc-server-hotlist '("localhost" . macos-contacts))

;;; Code:

(require 'eudc)
(require 'executable)

Searches for all persons matching QUERY.  QUERY is a list of cons
cells (ATTR . VALUE) where ATTRs should be valid macOS Contacts
attribute names with space characters replaced by `_' characters.
Thus, to for instance search for the \"first name\" attribute in
the Contacts app, the corresponding ATTR would be the symbol
`first_name'.

Note that due to the way the Contacts app exposes its data via
AppleScript, the attributes listed in
`eudc-macos-contacts--unsearchable-attributes' can not be searched

QUERY, it is thus skipped, and the query is composed from the
other attributes in the QUERY."
