;;; Commentary:
;;    This library provides an interface to the macOS Contacts app as
;;    an EUDC data source.  It uses AppleScript to interface with the
;;    Contacts app on localhost, so no 3rd party tools are needed.

;;; Usage:
;;    (require 'eudcb-macos-contacts)
;;    (eudc-macos-contacts-set-server "localhost")

;;; Code:

(require 'eudc)
(require 'executable)
