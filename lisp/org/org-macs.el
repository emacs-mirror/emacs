;;; Commentary:

;; This file contains macro definitions, defsubst definitions, other
;; stuff needed for compilation and top-level forms in Org mode, as
;; well lots of small functions that are not Org mode specific but
;; simply generally useful stuff.

(require 'cl-lib)

;;; Org version verification.

(defmacro org-assert-version ()
  "Assert compile time and runtime version match."
  ;; We intentionally use a more permissive `org-release' instead of
  ;; `org-git-version' to work around deficiencies in Elisp
  ;; compilation after pulling latest changes.  Unchanged files will
  ;; not be re-compiled and thus their macro-expanded
  ;; `org-assert-version' calls would fail using strict
  ;; `org-git-version' check because the generated Org version strings
  ;; will not match.

     (warn "Org version mismatch.  Org loading aborted.
This warning usually appears when a built-in Org version is loaded
prior to the more recent Org version.

Version mismatch is commonly encountered in the following situations:

1. Emacs is loaded using literate Org config and more recent Org
   version is loaded inside the file loaded by `org-babel-load-file'.
   `org-babel-load-file' triggers the built-in Org version clashing
   the newer Org version attempt to be loaded later.

   It is recommended to move the Org loading code before the
   `org-babel-load-file' call.

2. New Org version is loaded manually by setting `load-path', but some
   other package depending on Org is loaded before the `load-path' is
   configured.
   This \"other package\" is triggering built-in Org version, again
   causing the version mismatch.

   It is recommended to set `load-path' as early in the config as
   possible.

3. New Org version is loaded using straight.el package manager and
   other package depending on Org is loaded before straight triggers
   loading of the newer Org version.

   It is recommended to put

    %s

   early in the config.  Ideally, right after the straight.el
   bootstrap.  Moving `use-package' :straight declaration may not be
   sufficient if the corresponding `use-package' statement is
   deferring the loading."
