;;; Commentary:

;; Right now this is just a set of functions to play with.  It depends
;; on the epg library.  Here's how you would use it:
;;
;; 1. To mark an entry for encryption, tag the heading with "crypt".
;;    You can change the tag to any complex tag matching string by
;;    setting the `org-crypt-tag-matcher' variable.
;;
;; 2. Set the encryption key to use in the `org-crypt-key' variable,
;;    or use `M-x org-set-property' to set the property CRYPTKEY to
;;    any address in your public keyring.  The text of the entry (but
;;    not its properties or headline) will be encrypted for this user.
;;    For them to read it, the corresponding secret key must be
;;    located in the secret key ring of the account where you try to
;;    decrypt it.  This makes it possible to leave secure notes that
;;    only the intended recipient can read in a shared-org-mode-files
;;    scenario.
;;    If the key is not set, org-crypt will default to symmetric encryption.
;;
;; 3. To later decrypt an entry, use `org-decrypt-entries' or
;;    `org-decrypt-entry'.  It might be useful to bind this to a key,
;;    like C-c C-/.
;;
;; 4. To automatically encrypt all necessary entries when saving a
;;    file, call `org-crypt-use-before-save-magic' after loading
;;    org-crypt.el.
