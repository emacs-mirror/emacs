;;; Commentary:

;; This file contains an alternative implementation of the functionality
;; that used to be provided by org-remember.el.  The implementation is more
;; streamlined, can produce more target types (e.g. plain list items or
;; table lines).  Also, it does not use a temporary buffer for editing
;; the captured entry - instead it uses an indirect buffer that visits
;; the new entry already in the target buffer (this was an idea by Samuel
;; Wales).  John Wiegley's excellent `remember.el' is not needed anymore
;; for this implementation, even though we borrow heavily from its ideas.

;; This implementation heavily draws on ideas by James TD Smith and
;; Samuel Wales, and, of cause, uses John Wiegley's remember.el as inspiration.

;;; TODO

;; - find a clever way to not always insert an annotation maybe a
;;   predicate function that can check for conditions for %a to be
;;   used.  This could be one of the properties.

;; - Should there be plist members that arrange for properties to be
;;   asked for, like James proposed in his RFC?

  "Templates for the creation of new entries.

Each entry is a list with the following items:

keys         The keys that will select the template, as a string, characters
             only, for example \"a\" for a template to be selected with a
             single key, or \"bt\" for selection with two keys.  When using
             several keys, keys using the same prefix key must be together
             in the list and preceded by a 2-element entry explaining the
             prefix key, for example

                     (\"b\" \"Templates for marking stuff to buy\")

             The \"C\" key is used by default for quick access to the
             customization of the template variable.  But if you want to use
             that key for a template, you can.

description  A short string describing the template, will be shown during
             selection.

type         The type of entry.  Valid types are:
               entry       an Org-mode node, with a headline.  Will be
                           filed as the child of the target entry or as
                           a top-level entry.
               item        a plain list item, will be placed in the
                           first plain list at the target
                           location.
               checkitem   a checkbox item.  This differs from the
                           plain list item only is so far as it uses a
                           different default template.
               table-line  a new line in the first table at target location.
               plain       text to be inserted as it is.

target       Specification of where the captured item should be placed.
             In Org-mode files, targets usually define a node.  Entries will
             become children of this node, other types will be added to the
             table or list in the body of this node.

             Most target specifications contain a file name.  If that file
             name is the empty string, it defaults to `org-default-notes-file'.
             A file can also be given as a variable, function, or Emacs Lisp
             form.

             Valid values are:

             (file \"path/to/file\")
                 Text will be placed at the beginning or end of that file

             (id \"id of existing org entry\")
                 File as child of this entry, or in the body of the entry

             (file+headline \"path/to/file\" \"node headline\")
                 Fast configuration if the target heading is unique in the file

             (file+olp \"path/to/file\" \"Level 1 heading\" \"Level 2\" ...)
                 For non-unique headings, the full path is safer

             (file+regexp  \"path/to/file\" \"regexp to find location\")
                 File to the entry matching regexp

             (file+datetree \"path/to/file\")
                 Will create a heading in a date tree for today's date

             (file+datetree+prompt \"path/to/file\")
                 Will create a heading in a date tree, prompts for date

             (file+function \"path/to/file\" function-finding-location)
                 A function to find the right location in the file

             (clock)
                File to the entry that is currently being clocked

             (function function-finding-location)
                Most general way, write your own function to find both
                file and location

template     The template for creating the capture item.  If you leave this
             empty, an appropriate default template will be used.  See below
             for more details.  Instead of a string, this may also be one of

                 (file \"/path/to/template-file\")
                 (function function-returning-the-template)

             in order to get a template from a file, or dynamically
             from a function.

The rest of the entry is a property list of additional options.  Recognized
properties are:

 :prepend            Normally newly captured information will be appended at
                     the target location (last child, last table line,
                     last list item...).  Setting this property will
                     change that.

 :immediate-finish   When set, do not offer to edit the information, just
                     file it away immediately.  This makes sense if the
                     template only needs information that can be added
                     automatically.

 :jump-to-captured   When set, jump to the captured entry when finished.

 :empty-lines        Set this to the number of lines the should be inserted
                     before and after the new item.  Default 0, only common
                     other value is 1.

 :empty-lines-before Set this to the number of lines the should be inserted
                     before the new item.  Overrides :empty-lines for the
                     number lines inserted before.

 :empty-lines-after  Set this to the number of lines the should be inserted
                     after the new item.  Overrides :empty-lines for the
                     number of lines inserted after.

 :clock-in           Start the clock in this item.

 :clock-keep         Keep the clock running when filing the captured entry.

 :clock-resume       Start the interrupted clock when finishing the capture.
                     Note that :clock-keep has precedence over :clock-resume.
                     When setting both to t, the current clock will run and
                     the previous one will not be resumed.

 :unnarrowed         Do not narrow the target buffer, simply show the
                     full buffer.  Default is to narrow it so that you
                     only see the new stuff.

 :table-line-pos     Specification of the location in the table where the
                     new line should be inserted.  It should be a string like
                     \"II-3\", meaning that the new line should become the
                     third line before the second horizontal separator line.

 :kill-buffer        If the target file was not yet visited by a buffer when
                     capture was invoked, kill the buffer again after capture
                     is finalized.

The template defines the text to be inserted.  Often this is an
org-mode entry (so the first line should start with a star) that
will be filed as a child of the target headline.  It can also be
freely formatted text.  Furthermore, the following %-escapes will
be replaced with content and expanded in this order:

  %[pathname] Insert the contents of the file given by `pathname'.
  %(sexp)     Evaluate elisp `(sexp)' and replace it with the results.
              For convenience, %:keyword (see below) placeholders within
              the expression will be expanded prior to this.
  %<...>      The result of format-time-string on the ... format specification.
  %t          Time stamp, date only.
  %T          Time stamp with date and time.
  %u, %U      Like the above, but inactive time stamps.
  %i          Initial content, copied from the active region.  If %i is
              indented, the entire inserted text will be indented as well.
  %a          Annotation, normally the link created with `org-store-link'.
  %A          Like %a, but prompt for the description part.
  %l          Like %a, but only insert the literal link.
  %c          Current kill ring head.
  %x          Content of the X clipboard.
  %k          Title of currently clocked task.
  %K          Link to currently clocked task.
  %n          User name (taken from the variable `user-full-name').
  %f          File visited by current buffer when org-capture was called.
  %F          Full path of the file or directory visited by current buffer.
  %:keyword   Specific information for certain link types, see below.
  %^g         Prompt for tags, with completion on tags in target file.
  %^G         Prompt for tags, with completion on all tags in all agenda files.
  %^t         Like %t, but prompt for date.  Similarly %^T, %^u, %^U.
              You may define a prompt like: %^{Please specify birthday}t
  %^C         Interactive selection of which kill or clip to use.
  %^L         Like %^C, but insert as link.
  %^{prop}p   Prompt the user for a value for property `prop'.
  %^{prompt}  Prompt the user for a string and replace this sequence with it.
              A default value and a completion table ca be specified like this:
              %^{prompt|default|completion2|completion3|...}.
  %?          After completing the template, position cursor here.
  %\\n         Insert the text entered at the nth %^{prompt}, where `n' is
              a number, starting from 1.

Apart from these general escapes, you can access information specific to
the link type that is created.  For example, calling `org-capture' in emails
or in Gnus will record the author and the subject of the message, which you
can access with \"%:from\" and \"%:subject\", respectively.  Here is a
complete list of what is recorded for each link type.

Link type               |  Available information

bbdb                    |  %:type %:name %:company

                        |  %:fromto (either \"to NAME\" or \"from NAME\")
                        |  %:date %:date-timestamp (as active timestamp)

in `org-capture-templates'.  In this case, interactive selection
will be bypassed.

If `org-capture-use-agenda-date' is non-nil, capturing from the
agenda will use the date at point as the default date.  Then, a
`C-1' prefix will tell the capture process to use the HH:MM time
of the day at point (if any) or the current HH:MM time."
