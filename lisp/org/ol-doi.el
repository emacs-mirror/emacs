;;; Commentary:

;; This library introduces the "doi" link type in Org, and provides
;; code for opening and exporting such links.

;;; Code:

(require 'org-macs)
(org-assert-version)

(require 'ol)

(defcustom org-link-doi-server-url "https://doi.org/"
  "The URL of the DOI server."
  :group 'org-link-follow
  :version "24.3"
  :type 'string
  :safe #'stringp)

(defun org-link-doi-open (path arg)
  "Open a \"doi\" type link.
PATH is a the path to search for, as a string."
  (browse-url (url-encode-url (concat org-link-doi-server-url path)) arg))

(defun org-link-doi-export (path desc backend info)
  "Export a \"doi\" type link.
PATH is the DOI name.  DESC is the description of the link, or
nil.  BACKEND is a symbol representing the backend used for
export.  INFO is a plist containing the export parameters."
  (let ((uri (concat org-link-doi-server-url path)))
    (pcase backend
      (`html
       (format "<a href=\"%s\">%s</a>" uri (or desc uri)))
      (`latex
       (if desc (format "\\href{%s}{%s}" uri desc)
	 (format "\\url{%s}" uri)))
      (`ascii
       (if (not desc) (format "<%s>" uri)
         (concat (format "[%s]" desc)
		 (and (not (plist-get info :ascii-links-to-notes))
		      (format " (<%s>)" uri)))))
      (`texinfo
       (if (not desc) (format "@uref{%s}" uri)
         (format "@uref{%s, %s}" uri desc)))
      (_ uri))))

                         :export #'org-link-doi-export)
