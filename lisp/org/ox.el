;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This library implements a generic export engine for Org, built on
;; its syntactical parser: Org Elements.
;;
;; Besides that parser, the generic exporter is made of three distinct
;; parts:
;;
;; - The communication channel consists in a property list, which is
;;   created and updated during the process.  Its use is to offer
;;   every piece of information, would it be about initial environment
;;   or contextual data, all in a single place.  The exhaustive list
;;   of properties is given in "The Communication Channel" section of
;;   this file.
;;
;; - The transcoder walks the parse tree, ignores or treat as plain
;;   text elements and objects according to export options, and
;;   eventually calls back-end specific functions to do the real
;;   transcoding, concatenating their return value along the way.
;;
;; - The filter system is activated at the very beginning and the very
;;   end of the export process, and each time an element or an object
;;   has been converted.  It is the entry point to fine-tune standard
;;   output from back-end transcoders.  See "The Filter System"
;;   section for more information.
;;
;; The core function is `org-export-as'.  It returns the transcoded
;; buffer as a string.
;;
;; An export back-end is defined with `org-export-define-backend'.
;; This function can also support specific buffer keywords, OPTION
;; keyword's items and filters.  Refer to function's documentation for
;; more information.
;;
;; If the new back-end shares most properties with another one,
;; `org-export-define-derived-backend' can be used to simplify the
;; process.
;;
;; Any back-end can define its own variables.  Among them, those
;; customizable should belong to the `org-export-BACKEND' group.
;;
;; Tools for common tasks across back-ends are implemented in the
;; following part of the file.
;;
;; Then, a wrapper macro for asynchronous export,
;; `org-export-async-start', along with tools to display results. are
;; given in the penultimate part.
;;
;; Eventually, a dispatcher (`org-export-dispatch') for standard
;; back-ends is provided in the last one.

  property).
OPTION is a string that could be found in an #+OPTIONS: line.
DEFAULT is the default value for the property.
BEHAVIOR determines how Org should handle multiple keywords for
  the same property.  It is a symbol among:
  nil       Keep old value and discard the new one.
  t         Replace old value with the new one.
  `space'   Concatenate the values, separating them with a space.
  `newline' Concatenate the values, separating them with

  `split'   Split values at white spaces, and cons them to the
	    previous list.

 x_{i^2} or   x^(2-i)    braces or parenthesis do grouping.

Still, ambiguity is possible.  So when in doubt, use {} to enclose
the sub/superscript.  If you set this variable to the symbol `{}',
the braces are *required* in order to trigger interpretations as
sub/superscript.  This can be helpful in documents that need \"_\"
frequently in plain text."

;;; Defining Back-ends
;;
;; An export back-end is a structure with `org-export-backend' type
;; and `name', `parent', `transcoders', `options', `filters', `blocks'
;; and `menu' slots.
;;
;; At the lowest level, a back-end is created with
;; `org-export-create-backend' function.
;;
;; A named back-end can be registered with
;; `org-export-register-backend' function.  A registered back-end can
;; later be referred to by its name, with `org-export-get-backend'
;; function.  Also, such a back-end can become the parent of a derived
;; back-end from which slot values will be inherited by default.
;; `org-export-derived-backend-p' can check if a given back-end is
;; derived from a list of back-end names.
;;
;; `org-export-get-all-transcoders', `org-export-get-all-options' and
;; `org-export-get-all-filters' return the full alist of transcoders,
;; options and filters, including those inherited from ancestors.
;;
;; At a higher level, `org-export-define-backend' is the standard way
;; to define an export back-end.  If the new back-end is similar to
;; a registered back-end, `org-export-define-derived-backend' may be
;; used instead.
;;
;; Eventually `org-export-barf-if-invalid-backend' returns an error
;; when a given back-end hasn't been registered yet.

TRANSCODERS is an alist between object or element types and
functions handling them.

These functions should return a string without any trailing
space, or nil.  They must accept three arguments: the object or
element itself, its contents or nil when it isn't recursive and
the property list used as a communication channel.

Contents, when not nil, are stripped from any global indentation
\(although the relative one is preserved).  They also always end
with a single newline character.

If, for a given type, no function is found, that element or
object type will simply be ignored, along with any blank line or
white space at its end.  The same will happen if the function
returns the nil value.  If that function returns the empty
string, the type will be ignored, but the blank lines or white
spaces will be kept.

In addition to element and object types, one function can be
associated to the `template' (or `inner-template') symbol and
another one to the `plain-text' symbol.

The former returns the final transcoded string, and can be used
to add a preamble and a postamble to document's body.  It must
accept two arguments: the transcoded string and the property list
containing export options.  A function associated to `template'
will not be applied if export has option \"body-only\".
A function associated to `inner-template' is always applied.

The latter, when defined, is to be called on every text not
recognized as an element or an object.  It must accept two
arguments: the text string and the information channel.  It is an
appropriate place to protect special chars relative to the
back-end.

BODY can start with pre-defined keyword arguments.  The following
keywords are understood:

  :export-block

    String, or list of strings, representing block names that
    will not be parsed.  This is used to specify blocks that will
    contain raw code specific to the back-end.  These blocks
    still have to be handled by the relative `export-block' type
    translator.

  :filters-alist

    Alist between filters and function, or list of functions,
    specific to the back-end.  See `org-export-filters-alist' for
    a list of all allowed filters.  Filters defined here
    shouldn't make a back-end test, as it may prevent back-ends
    derived from this one to behave properly.

  :menu-entry

    Menu entry for the export dispatcher.  It should be a list
    like:

      (KEY DESCRIPTION-OR-ORDINAL ACTION-OR-MENU)

    where :

      KEY is a free character selecting the back-end.

      DESCRIPTION-OR-ORDINAL is either a string or a number.

      If it is a string, is will be used to name the back-end in
      its menu entry.  If it is a number, the following menu will
      be displayed as a sub-menu of the back-end with the same
      KEY.  Also, the number will be used to determine in which
      order such sub-menus will appear (lowest first).

      ACTION-OR-MENU is either a function or an alist.

      If it is an action, it will be called with four
      arguments (booleans): ASYNC, SUBTREEP, VISIBLE-ONLY and
      BODY-ONLY.  See `org-export-as' for further explanations on
      some of them.

      If it is an alist, associations should follow the
      pattern:

        (KEY DESCRIPTION ACTION)

      where KEY, DESCRIPTION and ACTION are described above.

    Valid values include:

       (?m \"My Special Back-end\" my-special-export-function)

      or

       (?l \"Export to LaTeX\"
           \(?p \"As PDF file\" org-latex-export-to-pdf)
           \(?o \"As PDF file and open\"
               \(lambda (a s v b)
                 \(if a (org-latex-export-to-pdf t s v b)
                   \(org-open-file
                    \(org-latex-export-to-pdf nil s v b)))))))

      or the following, which will be added to the previous
      sub-menu,

       (?l 1
          \((?B \"As TEX buffer (Beamer)\" org-beamer-export-as-latex)
           \(?P \"As PDF file (Beamer)\" org-beamer-export-to-pdf)))

  :options-alist

    communication channel and how their value are acquired.  See
    `org-export-options-alist' for more information about
    structure of the values."

;;; The Communication Channel
;;
;; During export process, every function has access to a number of
;; properties.  They are of two types:
;;
;; 1. Environment options are collected once at the very beginning of
;;    the process, out of the original buffer and configuration.
;;    Collecting them is handled by `org-export-get-environment'
;;    function.
;;
;;    Most environment options are defined through the
;;    `org-export-options-alist' variable.
;;
;; 2. Tree properties are extracted directly from the parsed tree,
;;    just before export, by `org-export-collect-tree-properties'.
;;
;; Here is the full list of properties available during transcode
;; process, with their category and their value type.
;;
;; + `:author' :: Author's name.
;;   - category :: option
;;   - type :: string
;;
;; + `:back-end' :: Current back-end used for transcoding.
;;   - category :: tree
;;   - type :: symbol
;;
;; + `:creator' :: String to write as creation information.
;;   - category :: option
;;   - type :: string
;;
;; + `:date' :: String to use as date.
;;   - category :: option
;;   - type :: string
;;
;; + `:description' :: Description text for the current data.
;;   - category :: option
;;   - type :: string
;;
;; + `:email' :: Author's email.
;;   - category :: option
;;   - type :: string
;;
;; + `:exclude-tags' :: Tags for exclusion of subtrees from export
;;      process.
;;   - category :: option
;;   - type :: list of strings
;;
;; + `:export-options' :: List of export options available for current
;;      process.
;;   - category :: none
;;   - type :: list of symbols, among `subtree', `body-only' and
;;      `visible-only'.
;;
;; + `:exported-data' :: Hash table used for memoizing
;;     `org-export-data'.
;;   - category :: tree
;;   - type :: hash table
;;
;; + `:filetags' :: List of global tags for buffer.  Used by
;;   `org-export-get-tags' to get tags with inheritance.
;;   - category :: option
;;   - type :: list of strings
;;
;; + `:footnote-definition-alist' :: Alist between footnote labels and
;;      their definition, as parsed data.  Only non-inlined footnotes
;;      are represented in this alist.  Also, every definition isn't
;;      guaranteed to be referenced in the parse tree.  The purpose of
;;      this property is to preserve definitions from oblivion
;;      (i.e. when the parse tree comes from a part of the original
;;      buffer), it isn't meant for direct use in a back-end.  To
;;      retrieve a definition relative to a reference, use
;;      `org-export-get-footnote-definition' instead.
;;   - category :: option
;;   - type :: alist (STRING . LIST)
;;
;; + `:headline-levels' :: Maximum level being exported as an
;;      headline.  Comparison is done with the relative level of
;;      headlines in the parse tree, not necessarily with their
;;      actual level.
;;   - category :: option
;;   - type :: integer
;;
;; + `:headline-offset' :: Difference between relative and real level
;;      of headlines in the parse tree.  For example, a value of -1
;;      means a level 2 headline should be considered as level
;;      1 (cf. `org-export-get-relative-level').
;;   - category :: tree
;;   - type :: integer
;;
;; + `:headline-numbering' :: Alist between headlines and their
;;      numbering, as a list of numbers
;;      (cf. `org-export-get-headline-number').
;;   - category :: tree
;;   - type :: alist (INTEGER . LIST)
;;

;;;; Environment Options

;;; The Transcoder

;;; The Filter System
;;
;; Filters allow end-users to tweak easily the transcoded output.
;; They are the functional counterpart of hooks, as every filter in
;; a set is applied to the return value of the previous one.
;;
;; Every set is back-end agnostic.  Although, a filter is always
;; called, in addition to the string it applies to, with the back-end
;; used as argument, so it's easy for the end-user to add back-end
;; specific filters in the set.  The communication channel, as
;; a plist, is required as the third argument.
;;
;; From the developer side, filters sets can be installed in the
;; process with the help of `org-export-define-backend', which
;; internally stores filters as an alist.  Each association has a key
;; among the following symbols and a function or a list of functions
;; as value.
;;
;; - `:filter-options' applies to the property list containing export
;;   options.  Unlike to other filters, functions in this list accept
;;   two arguments instead of three: the property list containing
;;   export options and the back-end.  Users can set its value through
;;   `org-export-filter-options-functions' variable.
;;
;; - `:filter-parse-tree' applies directly to the complete parsed
;;   tree.  Users can set it through
;;   `org-export-filter-parse-tree-functions' variable.
;;
;; - `:filter-final-output' applies to the final transcoded string.
;;   Users can set it with `org-export-filter-final-output-functions'
;;   variable
;;
;; - `:filter-plain-text' applies to any string not recognized as Org
;;   syntax.  `org-export-filter-plain-text-functions' allows users to
;;   configure it.
;;
;; - `:filter-TYPE' applies on the string returned after an element or
;;   object of type TYPE has been transcoded.  A user can modify
;;   `org-export-filter-TYPE-functions'
;;
;; All filters sets are applied with
;; `org-export-filter-apply-functions' function.  Filters in a set are
;; applied in a LIFO fashion.  It allows developers to be sure that
;; their filters will be applied first.
;;
;; Filters properties are installed in communication channel with
;; `org-export-install-filters' function.
;;
;; Eventually, two hooks (`org-export-before-processing-hook' and
;; `org-export-before-parsing-hook') are run at the beginning of the
;; export process and just before parsing to allow for heavy structure
;; modifications.

;;; Asynchronous Export
;;
;; `org-export-async-start' is the entry point for asynchronous
;; export.  It recreates current buffer (including visibility,
;; narrowing and visited file) in an external Emacs process, and
;; evaluates a command there.  It then applies a function on the
;; returned results in the current process.
;;
;; At a higher level, `org-export-to-buffer' and `org-export-to-file'
;; allow to export to a buffer or a file, asynchronously or not.
;;
;; `org-export-output-file-name' is an auxiliary function meant to be
;; used with `org-export-to-file'.  With a given extension, it tries
;; to provide a canonical file name to write export output to.
;;
;; Asynchronously generated results are never displayed directly.
;; Instead, they are stored in `org-export-stack-contents'.  They can
;; then be retrieved by calling `org-export-stack'.
;;
;; Export Stack is viewed through a dedicated major mode
;;`org-export-stack-mode' and tools: `org-export-stack-refresh',
;;`org-export-stack-delete', `org-export-stack-view' and
;;`org-export-stack-clear'.
;;
;; For back-ends, `org-export-add-to-stack' add a new source to stack.
;; It should be used whenever `org-export-async-start' is called.
