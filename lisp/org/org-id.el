;;; Commentary:

;; This file implements globally unique identifiers for Org entries.
;; Identifiers are stored in the entry as an :ID: property.  Functions
;; are provided that create and retrieve such identifiers, and that find
;; entries based on the identifier.

;; Identifiers consist of a prefix (default "Org" given by the variable
;; `org-id-prefix') and a unique part that can be created by a number
;; of different methods, see the variable `org-id-method'.
;; Org has a builtin method that uses a compact encoding of the creation
;; time of the ID, with microsecond accuracy.  This virtually
;; guarantees globally unique identifiers, even if several people are
;; creating IDs at the same time in files that will eventually be used
;; together.
;;
;; By default Org uses UUIDs as global unique identifiers.
;;
;; This file defines the following API:
;;
;; org-id-get-create
;;        Create an ID for the entry at point if it does not yet have one.
;;        Returns the ID (old or new).  This function can be used
;;        interactively, with prefix argument the creation of a new ID is
;;        forced, even if there was an old one.
;;
;; org-id-get
;;        Get the ID property of an entry.  Using appropriate arguments
;;        to the function, it can also create the ID for this entry.
;;
;; org-id-goto
;;        Command to go to a specific ID, this command can be used
;;        interactively.
;;
;; org-id-get-with-outline-path-completion
;;        Retrieve the ID of an entry, using outline path completion.
;;        This function can work for multiple files.
;;
;; org-id-get-with-outline-drilling
;;        Retrieve the ID of an entry, using outline path completion.
;;        This function only works for the current file.
;;
;; org-id-find
;;        Find the location of an entry with specific id.

create-if-interactive
      If `org-store-link' is called directly (interactively, as a user
      command), do create an ID to support the link.  But when doing the
      job for capture, only use the ID if it already exists.  The
      purpose of this setting is to avoid proliferation of unwanted
      IDs, just because you happen to be in an Org file when you
      call `org-capture' that automatically and preemptively creates a
      link.  If you do want to get an ID link in a capture template to
      an entry not having an ID, create it first by explicitly creating
      a link to it, using `\\[org-store-link]' first.

create-if-interactive-and-no-custom-id
      Like create-if-interactive, but do not create an ID if there is
      a CUSTOM_ID property defined in the entry.
