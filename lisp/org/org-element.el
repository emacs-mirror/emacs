;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Org syntax can be divided into three categories: "Greater
;; elements", "Elements" and "Objects".
;;
;; Elements are related to the structure of the document.  Indeed, all
;; elements are a cover for the document: each position within belongs
;; to at least one element.
;;
;; An element always starts and ends at the beginning of a line.  With
;; a few exceptions (`clock', `headline', `inlinetask', `item',
;; `planning', `node-property', `quote-section' `section' and
;; `table-row' types), it can also accept a fixed set of keywords as
;; attributes.  Those are called "affiliated keywords" to distinguish
;; them from other keywords, which are full-fledged elements.  Almost
;; all affiliated keywords are referenced in
;; `org-element-affiliated-keywords'; the others are export attributes
;; and start with "ATTR_" prefix.
;;
;; Element containing other elements (and only elements) are called
;; greater elements.  Concerned types are: `center-block', `drawer',
;; `dynamic-block', `footnote-definition', `headline', `inlinetask',
;; `item', `plain-list', `property-drawer', `quote-block', `section'
;; and `special-block'.
;;
;; Other element types are: `babel-call', `clock', `comment',
;; `comment-block', `diary-sexp', `example-block', `export-block',
;; `fixed-width', `horizontal-rule', `keyword', `latex-environment',
;; `node-property', `paragraph', `planning', `quote-section',
;; `src-block', `table', `table-row' and `verse-block'.  Among them,
;; `paragraph' and `verse-block' types can contain Org objects and
;; plain text.
;;
;; Objects are related to document's contents.  Some of them are
;; recursive.  Associated types are of the following: `bold', `code',
;; `entity', `export-snippet', `footnote-reference',
;; `inline-babel-call', `inline-src-block', `italic',
;; `latex-fragment', `line-break', `link', `macro', `radio-target',
;; `statistics-cookie', `strike-through', `subscript', `superscript',
;; `table-cell', `target', `timestamp', `underline' and `verbatim'.
;;
;; Some elements also have special properties whose value can hold
;; objects themselves (e.g. an item tag or a headline name).  Such
;; values are called "secondary strings".  Any object belongs to
;; either an element or a secondary string.
;;
;; Notwithstanding affiliated keywords, each greater element, element
;; and object has a fixed set of properties attached to it.  Among
;; them, four are shared by all types: `:begin' and `:end', which
;; refer to the beginning and ending buffer positions of the
;; considered element or object, `:post-blank', which holds the number
;; of blank lines, or white spaces, at its end and `:parent' which
;; refers to the element or object containing it.  Greater elements,
;; elements and objects containing objects will also have
;; `:contents-begin' and `:contents-end' properties to delimit
;; contents.  Eventually, greater elements and elements accepting
;; affiliated keywords will have a `:post-affiliated' property,
;; referring to the buffer position after all such keywords.
;;
;; At the lowest level, a `:parent' property is also attached to any
;; string, as a text property.
;;
;; Lisp-wise, an element or an object can be represented as a list.
;; It follows the pattern (TYPE PROPERTIES CONTENTS), where:
;;   TYPE is a symbol describing the Org element or object.
;;   PROPERTIES is the property list attached to it.  See docstring of
;;              appropriate parsing function to get an exhaustive
;;              list.
;;   CONTENTS is a list of elements, objects or raw strings contained
;;            in the current element or object, when applicable.
;;
;; An Org buffer is a nested list of such elements and objects, whose
;; type is `org-data' and properties is nil.
;;
;; The first part of this file defines Org syntax, while the second
;; one provide accessors and setters functions.
;;
;; The next part implements a parser and an interpreter for each
;; element and object type in Org syntax.
;;
;; The following part creates a fully recursive buffer parser.  It
;; also provides a tool to map a function to elements or objects
;; matching some criteria in the parse tree.  Functions of interest
;; are `org-element-parse-buffer', `org-element-map' and, to a lesser
;; extent, `org-element-parse-secondary-string'.
;;
;; The penultimate part is the cradle of an interpreter for the
;; obtained parse tree: `org-element-interpret-data'.
;;
;; The library ends by furnishing `org-element-at-point' function, and
;; a way to give information about document structure around point
;; with `org-element-context'.


;;; Code:

(eval-when-compile (require 'cl))
(require 'org)



;;; Definitions And Rules
;;
;; Define elements, greater elements and specify recursive objects,
;; along with the affiliated keywords recognized.  Also set up
;; restrictions on recursive objects combinations.
;;
;; These variables really act as a control center for the parsing
;; process.

;;; Greater elements
;;

;; Most of them accepts no argument.  Though, exceptions exist.  Hence
;; every element containing a secondary string (see
;; `org-element-secondary-value-alist') will accept an optional
;; argument to toggle parsing of that secondary string.  Moreover,
;; `item' parser requires current list's structure as its first
;; element.
;;
;; An interpreter accepts two arguments: the list representation of
;; the element or object, and its contents.  The latter may be nil,
;; depending on the element or object considered.  It returns the
;; appropriate Org syntax, as a string.
;;
;; Parsing functions must follow the naming convention:
;; org-element-TYPE-parser, where TYPE is greater element's type, as
;; defined in `org-element-greater-elements'.
;;
;; Similarly, interpreting functions must follow the naming
;; convention: org-element-TYPE-interpreter.
;;
;; With the exception of `headline' and `item' types, greater elements
;; cannot contain other greater elements of their own type.
;;
;; Beside implementing a parser and an interpreter, adding a new
;; greater element requires to tweak `org-element--current-element'.
;; Moreover, the newly defined type must be added to both

;;; Objects
;;
;; Unlike to elements, interstices can be found between objects.
;; That's why, along with the parser, successor functions are provided
;; for each object.  Some objects share the same successor (e.g.,
;; `code' and `verbatim' objects).
;;
;; A successor must accept a single argument bounding the search.  It
;; will return either a cons cell whose CAR is the object's type, as
;; a symbol, and CDR the position of its next occurrence, or nil.
;;
;; Successors follow the naming convention:
;; org-element-NAME-successor, where NAME is the name of the
;; successor, as defined in `org-element-all-successors'.
;;
;; Some object types (e.g., `italic') are recursive.  Restrictions on
;; object types they can contain will be specified in
;; `org-element-object-restrictions'.
;;
;; Adding a new type of object is simple.  Implement a successor,
;; a parser, and an interpreter for it, all following the naming
;; convention.  Register type in `org-element-all-objects' and
;; successor in `org-element-all-successors'.  Maybe tweak
;; restrictions about it, and that's it.

;; region, narrowing, or even visibility if specified, and
;; `org-element-parse-secondary-string', which parses objects within
;; a given string.
;;
;; The (almost) almighty `org-element-map' allows to apply a function
;; on elements or objects matching some type, and accumulate the
;; resulting values.  In an export situation, it also skips unneeded
;; parts of the parse tree.

(defun org-element-parse-buffer (&optional granularity visible-only)
  "Recursively parse the buffer and return structure.
If narrowing is in effect, only parse the visible part of the
buffer.

Optional argument GRANULARITY determines the depth of the
recursion.  It can be set to the following symbols:

`headline'          Only parse headlines.
`greater-element'   Don't recurse into greater elements excepted
		    headlines and sections.  Thus, elements
		    parsed are the top-level ones.
`element'           Parse everything but objects and plain text.
`object'            Parse the complete buffer (default).

When VISIBLE-ONLY is non-nil, don't parse contents of hidden
elements.

An element or an objects is represented as a list with the
pattern (TYPE PROPERTIES CONTENTS), where :

  TYPE is a symbol describing the element or object.  See
  `org-element-all-elements' and `org-element-all-objects' for an
  exhaustive list of such symbols.  One can retrieve it with
  `org-element-type' function.

  PROPERTIES is the list of attributes attached to the element or
  object, as a plist.  Although most of them are specific to the
  element or object type, all types share `:begin', `:end',
  `:post-blank' and `:parent' properties, which respectively
  refer to buffer position where the element or object starts,
  ends, the number of white spaces or blank lines after it, and
  the element or object containing it.  Properties values can be
  obtained by using `org-element-property' function.

  CONTENTS is a list of elements, objects or raw strings
  contained in the current element or object, when applicable.
  One can access them with `org-element-contents' function.

The Org buffer has `org-data' as type and nil as properties.
`org-element-map' function can be used to find specific elements
or objects within the parse tree.

elements or objects types (see `org-element-all-elements' and
`org-element-all-objects' for a complete list of types).  FUN is
the function called on the matching element or object.  It has to
accept one argument: the element or object itself.

When optional argument INFO is non-nil, it should be a plist
holding export options.  In that case, parts of the parse tree
not exportable according to that property list will be skipped.

When optional argument FIRST-MATCH is non-nil, stop at the first
match for which FUN doesn't return nil, and return that value.

Optional argument NO-RECURSION is a symbol or a list of symbols
representing elements or objects types.  `org-element-map' won't
enter any recursive element or object whose type belongs to that
list.  Though, FUN can still be applied on them.

When optional argument WITH-AFFILIATED is non-nil, FUN will also
apply to matching objects within parsed affiliated keywords (see
`org-element-parsed-keywords').

Nil values returned from FUN do not appear in the results.


Examples:
---------

Assuming TREE is a variable containing an Org buffer parse tree,
the following example will return a flat list of all `src-block'
and `example-block' elements in it:

  \(org-element-map tree \\='(example-block src-block) \\='identity)

The following snippet will find the first headline with a level
of 1 and a \"phone\" tag, and will return its beginning position:

  \(org-element-map tree \\='headline
   \(lambda (hl)
     \(and (= (org-element-property :level hl) 1)
          \(member \"phone\" (org-element-property :tags hl))
          \(org-element-property :begin hl)))
   nil t)

The next example will return a flat list of all `plain-list' type
elements in TREE that are not a sub-list themselves:

  \(org-element-map tree \\='plain-list \\='identity nil nil \\='plain-list)

Eventually, this example will return a flat list of all `bold'
type objects containing a `latex-snippet' type object, even
looking into captions:

  \(org-element-map tree \\='bold
   \(lambda (b)
     \(and (org-element-map b \\='latex-snippet \\='identity nil t) b))
