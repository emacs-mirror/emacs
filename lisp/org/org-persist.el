;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This file implements persistent cache storage across Emacs sessions.
;; Both global and buffer-local data can be stored.  This
;; implementation is not meant to be used to store important data -
;; all the caches should be safe to remove at any time.
;;
;; Example usage:
;;
;; 1. Temporarily cache Elisp symbol value to disk.  Remove upon
;;    closing Emacs:
;;    (org-persist-write 'variable-symbol)
;;    (org-persist-read 'variable-symbol) ;; read the data later
;; 2. Temporarily cache a remote URL file to disk.  Remove upon
;;    closing Emacs:
;;    (org-persist-write 'url "https://static.fsf.org/common/img/logo-new.png")
;;    (org-persist-read 'url "https://static.fsf.org/common/img/logo-new.png")
;;    `org-persist-read' will return the cached file location or nil if cached file
;;    has been removed.
;; 3. Temporarily cache a file, including TRAMP path to disk:
;;    (org-persist-write 'file "/path/to/file")
;; 4. Cache file or URL while some other file exists.
;;    (org-persist-register '(url "https://static.fsf.org/common/img/logo-new.png") '(:file "/path to the other file") :expiry 'never :write-immediately t)
;;    or, if the other file is current buffer file
;;    (org-persist-register '(url "https://static.fsf.org/common/img/logo-new.png") (current-buffer) :expiry 'never :write-immediately t)
;; 5. Cache value of a Elisp variable to disk.  The value will be
;;    saved and restored automatically (except buffer-local
;;    variables).
;;    ;; Until `org-persist-default-expiry'
;;    (org-persist-register 'variable-symbol)
;;    ;; Specify expiry explicitly
;;    (org-persist-register 'variable-symbol :expiry 'never)
;;    ;; Save buffer-local variable (buffer-local will not be
;;    ;; autoloaded!)
;;    (org-persist-register 'org-element--cache (current-buffer))
;;    ;; Save buffer-local variable preserving circular links:
;;    (org-persist-register 'org-element--headline-cache (current-buffer)
;;               :inherit 'org-element--cache)
;; 6. Load variable by side effects assigning variable symbol:
;;    (org-persist-load 'variable-symbol (current-buffer))
;; 7. Version variable value:
;;    (org-persist-register '((elisp variable-symbol) (version "2.0")))
;; 8. Cancel variable persistence:
;;    (org-persist-unregister 'variable-symbol 'all) ; in all buffers
;;    (org-persist-unregister 'variable-symbol) ;; global variable
;;    (org-persist-unregister 'variable-symbol (current-buffer)) ;; buffer-local
;;
;; Most common data type is variable data.  However, other data types
;; can also be stored.
;;
;; Persistent data is stored in individual files.  Each of the files
;; can contain a collection of related data, which is particularly
;; useful when, say, several variables cross-reference each-other's
;; data-cells and we want to preserve their circular structure.
;;
;; Each data collection can be associated with a local or remote file,
;; its inode number, or contents hash.  The persistent data collection
;; can later be accessed using either file buffer, file, inode, or
;; contents hash.
;;
;; The data collections can be versioned and removed upon expiry.
;;
;; In the code below I will use the following naming conventions:
;; 1. Container :: a type of data to be stored
;;    Containers can store elisp variables, files, and version
;;    numbers.  Each container can be customized with container
;;    options.  For example, `elisp' container is customized with
;;    variable symbol.  (elisp variable) is a container storing
;;    Lisp variable value.  Similarly, (version "2.0") container
;;    will store version number.
;; 2. Associated :: an object the container is associated with.  The
;;    object can be a buffer, file, inode number, file contents hash,
;;    a generic key, or multiple of them.  Associated can also be nil.
;; 3. Data collection :: a list of containers linked to an associated
;;    object/objects.  Each data collection can also have auxiliary
;;    records.  Their only purpose is readability of the collection
;;    index.
;; 4. Index file :: a file listing all the stored data collections.
;; 5. Persist file :: a file holding data values or references to
;;    actual data values for a single data collection.  This file
;;    contains an alist associating each data container in data
;;    collection with its value or a reference to the actual value.
;;
;; All the persistent data is stored in `org-persist-directory'.  The data
;; collections are listed in `org-persist-index-file' and the actual data is
;; stored in UID-style subfolders.
;;
;; The `org-persist-index-file' stores the value of `org-persist--index'.
;;
;; Each collection is represented as a plist containing the following
;; properties:
;; - `:container'   : list of data continers to be stored in single
;;                    file;
;; - `:persist-file': data file name;
;; - `:associated'  : list of associated objects;
;; - `:last-access' : last date when the container has been accessed;
;; - `:expiry'      : list of expiry conditions.
;; - all other keywords are ignored
;;
;; The available types of data containers are:
;; 1. (file variable-symbol) or just variable-symbol :: Storing
;;    elisp variable data.
;; 2. (file) :: Store a copy of the associated file preserving the
;;    extension.
;;    (file "/path/to/a/file") :: Store a copy of the file in path.
;; 3. (version "version number") :: Version the data collection.
;;     If the stored collection has different version than "version
;;     number", disregard it.
;; 4. (url) :: Store a downloaded copy of URL object.
;;
;; The data collections can expire, in which case they will be removed
;; from the persistent storage at the end of Emacs session.  The
;; expiry condition can be set when saving/registering data
;; containers.  The expirty condition can be `never' - data will never
;; expire; nil - data will expire at the end of current Emacs session;
;; a number - data will expire after the number days from last access;
;; a function - data will expire if the function, called with a single
;; argument - collection, returns non-nil.
;;
;;
;; Data collections associated with files will automatically expire
;; when the file is removed.  If the associated file is remote, the
;; expiry is controlled by `org-persist-remote-files' instead.
;;
;; Data loading/writing can be more accurately controlled using
;; `org-persist-before-write-hook', `org-persist-before-read-hook', and `org-persist-after-read-hook'.
