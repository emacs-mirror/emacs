;;; Commentary:

;; Now working with SBCL for both session and external evaluation.
;;
;; This certainly isn't optimally robust, but it seems to be working
;; for the basic use cases.

;;; Requirements:

;; - a working scheme implementation
;;   (e.g. guile http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/guile.html)
;;
;; - for session based evaluation geiser is required, which is available from
;;   ELPA.
