;;; Commentary:

;; Note: This file includes several codepoints outside of the Unicode
;; 0..#x10FFFF range, which are characters that were not unified into
;; Unicode.  Therefore, this file is encoded in utf-8-emacs, because
;; UTF-8 cannot encode such codepoints.  We include these codepoints
;; literally in the file to have them displayed by suitable fonts,
;; which makes maintenance easier.
