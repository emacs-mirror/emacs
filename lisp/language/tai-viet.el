TaiViet refers to the Tai script, which is used to write several
Tai languages of northwestern Vietnam and surrounding areas.  These
languages are Tai Dam (also known as Black Tai or Tai Noir),
Tai Dón (also known as White Tai or Tai Blanc), Tày Tac,
Tai Daeng (also known as Red Tai or Tai Rouge),
and Thai Song (also known as Lao Song).  However, some people
consider Tai Dam, Tai Dón and Tai Daeng to be dialects of the
same language, and call them collectively \"Tai Viet\".

Both the script and languages have the same origin as that of Thai
language/script used in Thailand, but now they differ from each
other in a significant way (especially the scripts are).

The language name is spelled as \"ꪁꪫꪱꪣ ꪼꪕ\", and the script name is
spelled as \"ꪎꪳ ꪼꪕ\".")))
