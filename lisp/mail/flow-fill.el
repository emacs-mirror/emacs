;;; Commentary:

;; This implement decoding of RFC2646 formatted text, including the
;; quoted-depth wins rules.

;; Theory of operation: search for lines ending with SPC, save quote
;; length of line, remove SPC and concatenate line with the following
;; line if quote length of following line matches current line.

;; When no further concatenations are possible, we've found a
;; paragraph and we let `fill-region' fill the long line into several
;; lines with the quote prefix as `fill-prefix'.

;; Todo: implement basic `fill-region'

;;; History:

;; 2000-02-17  posted on ding mailing list
;; 2000-02-19  use `point-at-{b,e}ol' in XEmacs
;; 2000-03-11  no compile warnings for point-at-bol stuff
;; 2000-03-26  committed to gnus cvs
;; 2000-10-23  don't flow "-- " lines, make "quote-depth wins" rule
;;             work when first line is at level 0.
;; 2002-01-12  probably incomplete encoding support
;; 2003-12-08  started working on test harness.
