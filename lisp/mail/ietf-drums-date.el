;;; Commentary:

;; 'ietf-drums-parse-date-string' parses a time and/or date in a
;; string and returns a list of values, just like `decode-time', where
;; unspecified elements in the string are returned as nil (except
;; unspecified DST is returned as -1).  `encode-time' may be applied
;; on these values to obtain an internal time value.

;; Historically, `parse-time-string' was used for this purpose, but it
;; was gradually but imperfectly extended to handle other date
;; formats.  'ietf-drums-parse-date-string' is compatible in that it
;; uses the same return value format and parses the same email date
;; formats by default, but can be made stricter if desired.

(defun ietf-drums-parse-date-string (time-string &optional error no-822)
  "Parse an RFC5322 or RFC822 date, passed as TIME-STRING.
The optional ERROR parameter causes syntax errors to be flagged
by signaling an instance of the date-parse-error condition.  The
optional NO-822 parameter disables the more lax RFC822 syntax,
which is permitted by default.

The result is a list of (SEC MIN HOUR DAY MON YEAR DOW DST TZ),
which can be accessed as a decoded-time defstruct (q.v.),
e.g. `decoded-time-year' to extract the year, and turned into an
Emacs timestamp by `encode-time'.

The strict syntax for RFC5322 is as follows:

   [ day-of-week \",\" ] day FWS month-name FWS year FWS time [CFWS]

where the \"time\" production is:

   2DIGIT \":\" 2DIGIT [ \":\" 2DIGIT ] FWS ( \"+\" / \"-\" ) 4DIGIT

and FWS is \"folding white space,\" and CFWS is \"comments and/or
folding white space\", where comments are included in nesting
parentheses and are equivalent to white space.  RFC822 also
accepts comments in random places (all of which is handled by
ietf-drums-date--tokenize-string) and two-digit years.  For
two-digit years, 50 and up are interpreted as 1950 through 1999
and 00 through 49 as 200 through 2049.

We are somewhat more lax in what we accept (specifically, the
hours don't have to be two digits, and the TZ and the comma after
the DOW are optional), but we do insist that the items that are
present do appear in this order.  Unspecified/unrecognized
elements in the string are returned as nil (except unspecified
DST is returned as -1)."
