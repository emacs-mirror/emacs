;;; Commentary

;; Plist based data store providing search and partial encryption.
;;
;; Creating:
;;
;; ;; Open a new store associated with ~/.emacs.d/auth.plist.
;; (setq store (plstore-open (expand-file-name "~/.emacs.d/auth.plist")))
;; ;; Both `:host' and `:port' are public property.
;; (plstore-put store "foo" '(:host "foo.example.org" :port 80) nil)
;; ;; No encryption will be needed.
;; (plstore-save store)
;;
;; ;; `:user' is marked as secret.
;; (plstore-put store "bar" '(:host "bar.example.org") '(:user "test"))
;; ;; `:password' is marked as secret.
;; (plstore-put store "baz" '(:host "baz.example.org") '(:password "test"))
;; ;; Those secret properties are encrypted together.
;; (plstore-save store)
;;
;; ;; Kill the buffer visiting ~/.emacs.d/auth.plist.
;; (plstore-close store)
;;
;; Searching:
;;
;; (setq store (plstore-open (expand-file-name "~/.emacs.d/auth.plist")))
;;
;; ;; As the entry "foo" associated with "foo.example.org" has no
;; ;; secret properties, no need to decryption.
;; (plstore-find store '(:host ("foo.example.org")))
;;
;; ;; As the entry "bar" associated with "bar.example.org" has a
;; ;; secret property `:user', Emacs tries to decrypt the secret (and
;; ;; thus you will need to input passphrase).
;; (plstore-find store '(:host ("bar.example.org")))
;;
;; ;; While the entry "baz" associated with "baz.example.org" has also
;; ;; a secret property `:password', it is encrypted together with
;; ;; `:user' of "bar", so no need to decrypt the secret.
;; (plstore-find store '(:host ("bar.example.org")))
;;
;; (plstore-close store)
;;
;; Editing:
;;
;; This file also provides `plstore-mode', a major mode for editing
;; the PLSTORE format file.  Visit a non-existing file and put the
;; following line:
;;
;; (("foo" :host "foo.example.org" :secret-user "user"))
;;
;; where the prefixing `:secret-' means the property (without
;; `:secret-' prefix) is marked as secret.  Thus, when you save the
;; buffer, the `:secret-user' property is encrypted as `:user'.
;;
;; You can toggle the view between encrypted form and the decrypted
;; form with C-c C-c.
