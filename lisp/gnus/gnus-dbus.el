;;; Commentary:

;; This library contains some Gnus integration for systems using DBUS.
;; At present it registers a signal to close all Gnus servers before
;; system sleep or hibernation.

;;; Code:

(require 'gnus)
(require 'dbus)
(declare-function gnus-close-all-servers "gnus-start")

(defcustom gnus-dbus-close-on-sleep nil
  "When non-nil, close Gnus servers on system sleep."
  :group 'gnus-dbus
  :type 'boolean)

(defvar gnus-dbus-sleep-registration-object nil
  "Object returned from `dbus-register-signal'.
Used to unregister the signal.")

(defun gnus-dbus-register-sleep-signal ()
  "Use `dbus-register-signal' to close servers on sleep."
  (when (featurep 'dbusbind)
    (setq gnus-dbus-sleep-registration-object
	  (dbus-register-signal :system
				"org.freedesktop.login1"
				"/org/freedesktop/login1"
				"org.freedesktop.login1.Manager"
				"PrepareForSleep"
				#'gnus-dbus-sleep-handler))
    (gnus-add-shutdown #'gnus-dbus-unregister-sleep-signal 'gnus)))

(defun gnus-dbus-sleep-handler (sleep-start)
  ;; Sleep-start is t before sleeping.
  (when (and sleep-start
	     (gnus-alive-p))
    (condition-case nil
	(gnus-close-all-servers)
      (error nil))))

(defun gnus-dbus-unregister-sleep-signal ()
  (condition-case nil
      (dbus-unregister-object
       gnus-dbus-sleep-registration-object)
    (wrong-type-argument nil)))

(provide 'gnus-dbus)
;;; gnus-dbus.el ends here
