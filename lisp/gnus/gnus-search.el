;;; Commentary:

;; This file defines a generalized search language, and search engines
;; that interface with various search programs.  It is responsible for
;; parsing the user's search input, sending that query to the search
;; engines, and collecting results.  Results are in the form of a
;; vector of vectors, each vector representing a found article.  The
;; nnselect backend interprets that value to create a group containing
;; the search results.

;; This file was formerly known as nnir.  Later, the backend parts of
;; nnir became nnselect, and only the search functionality was left
;; here.

;; See the Gnus manual for details of the search language.  Tests are
;; in tests/gnus-search-test.el.

;; The search parsing routines are responsible for accepting the
;; user's search query as a string and parsing it into a sexp
;; structure.  The function `gnus-search-parse-query' is the entry
;; point for that.  Once the query is in sexp form, it is passed to
;; the search engines themselves, which are responsible for
;; transforming the query into a form that the external program can
;; understand, and then filtering the search results into a format
;; that nnselect can understand.

;; The general flow is:

;; 1. The user calls one of `gnus-group-make-search-group' or
;; `gnus-group-make-permanent-search-group' (or a few other entry
;; points).  These functions prompt for a search query, and collect
;; the groups to search, then create an nnselect group, setting an
;; 'nnselect-specs group parameter where 'nnselect-function is
;; `gnus-search-run-query', and 'nnselect-args is the search query and
;; groups to search.

;; 2. `gnus-search-run-query' is called with 'nnselect-args.  It looks
;; at the groups to search, categorizes them by server, and for each
;; server finds the search engine to use.  It calls each engine's
;; `gnus-search-run-search' method with the query and groups passed as
;; arguments, and the results are collected and handed off to the
;; nnselect group.

;; For information on writing new search engines, see the Gnus manual.

;; TODO: Rewrite the query parser using syntax tables and
;; `parse-partial-sexp'.

;; TODO: Refactor IMAP search so we can move code that uses nnimap-*
;; functions out into nnimap.el.

;; TODO: Is there anything we can do about sorting results?

;; TODO: Provide for returning a result count.  This would probably
;; need a completely separate top-level command, since we wouldn't be
;; creating a group at all.

;;; Search language

;; This "language" was generalized from the original IMAP search query
;; parsing routine.

(defun gnus-search-parse-query (string)
  "Turn STRING into an s-expression based query.
The resulting query structure is passed to the various search
backends, each of which adapts it as needed.

The search \"language\" is essentially a series of key:value
expressions.  Key is most often a mail header, but there are
other keys.  Value is a string, quoted if it contains spaces.
Key and value are separated by a colon, no space.  Expressions
are implicitly ANDed; the \"or\" keyword can be used to
OR. \"not\" will negate the following expression, or keys can be
prefixed with a \"-\".  The \"near\" operator will work for
engines that understand it; other engines will convert it to
\"or\".  Parenthetical groups work as expected.

A key that matches the name of a mail header will search that
header.

Search keys can be expanded with TAB during entry, or left
abbreviated so long as they remain unambiguous, ie \"f\" will
search the \"from\" header. \"s\" will raise an error.

Other keys:

\"address\" will search all sender and recipient headers.

\"recipient\" will search \"To\", \"Cc\", and \"Bcc\".

\"before\" will search messages sent before the specified
date (date specifications to come later).  Date is exclusive.

\"after\" (or its synonym \"since\") will search messages sent
after the specified date.  Date is inclusive.

\"mark\" will search messages that have some sort of mark.
Likely values include \"flag\", \"seen\", \"read\", \"replied\".
It's also possible to use Gnus' internal marks, ie \"mark:R\"
will be interpreted as mark:read.

\"tag\" will search tags -- right now that's translated to
\"keyword\" in IMAP, and left as \"tag\" for notmuch. At some
point this should also be used to search marks in the Gnus
registry.

Other keys can be specified, provided that the search backends
know how to interpret them.

External contact-management packages can push completion tables
onto the list variable `gnus-search-contact-tables', to provide
auto-completion of contact names and addresses for keys like
\"from\" and \"to\".

Date values (any key in `gnus-search-date-keys') can be provided
in any format that `parse-time-string' can parse (note that this
can produce weird results).  Dates with missing bits will be
interpreted as the most recent occurence thereof (ie \"march 03\"
is the most recent March 3rd).  Lastly, relative specifications
such as 1d (one day ago) are understood.  This also accepts w, m,
and y.  m is assumed to be 30 days.

This function will accept pretty much anything as input.  Its
only job is to parse the query into a sexp, and pass that on --
it is the job of the search backends to make sense of the
structured query.  Malformed, unusable or invalid queries will
typically be silently ignored."
