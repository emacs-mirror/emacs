;;; Commentary:

;; nnnil is a Gnus backend that provides no groups or articles.  It's useful
;; as a primary select method when you want all your real select methods to
;; be secondary or foreign.

;;; Code:

(eval-and-compile
  (require 'nnheader))

(defvar nnnil-status-string "")

(defun nnnil-retrieve-headers (_articles &optional _group _server _fetch-old)
  (with-current-buffer nntp-server-buffer
    (erase-buffer))
  'nov)

(defun nnnil-open-server (_server &optional _definitions)
  t)

(defun nnnil-close-server (&optional _server _defs)
  t)

(defun nnnil-request-close ()
  t)

(defun nnnil-server-opened (&optional _server)
  t)

(defun nnnil-status-message (&optional _server)
  nnnil-status-string)

(defun nnnil-request-article (_article &optional _group _server _to-buffer)
  (setq nnnil-status-string "No such group")
  nil)

(defun nnnil-request-group (_group &optional _server _fast _info)
  (let (deactivate-mark)
    (with-current-buffer nntp-server-buffer
      (erase-buffer)
      (insert "411 no such news group\n")))
  (setq nnnil-status-string "No such group")
  nil)

(defun nnnil-close-group (_group &optional _server)
  t)
