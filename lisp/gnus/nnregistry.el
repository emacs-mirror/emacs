;;; Commentary:

;; This file provides the `nnregistry' Gnus back-end.  It can be used
;; in `gnus-refer-article-method' to quickly search for a message by
;; id, regardless of the back-end that stores it.  See the Gnus manual
;; for usage examples and more information.

;;; Code:

(require 'nnoo)
(require 'gnus-registry)
(require 'gnus-int)

(nnoo-declare nnregistry)

(deffoo nnregistry-server-opened (_server)
  gnus-registry-db)

(deffoo nnregistry-close-server (_server &optional _defs)
  t)

(deffoo nnregistry-status-message (_server)
  nil)

(deffoo nnregistry-open-server (_server &optional _defs)
  gnus-registry-db)

(defvar nnregistry-within-nnregistry nil)

(deffoo nnregistry-request-article (id &optional _group _server buffer)
  (and (not nnregistry-within-nnregistry)
       (let* ((nnregistry-within-nnregistry t)
	      (group (nth 0 (gnus-registry-get-id-key id 'group)))
	      (gnus-override-method nil))
	 (message "nnregistry: requesting article `%s' in group `%s'"
		  id group)
	 (and group
	      (gnus-check-group group)
	      (gnus-request-article id group buffer)))))
