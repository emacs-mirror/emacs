;;; Commentary:

;; This library implements the JSONRPC 2.0 specification as described
;; in https://www.jsonrpc.org/.  As the name suggests, JSONRPC is a
;; generic Remote Procedure Call protocol designed around JSON
;; objects.  To learn how to write JSONRPC programs with this library,
;; see Info node `(elisp)JSONRPC'."
;;
;; This library was originally extracted from eglot.el, an Emacs LSP
;; client, which you should see for an example usage.
