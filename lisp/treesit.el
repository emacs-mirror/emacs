;;; Commentary:

;; This file is the Lisp counterpart of treesit.c.  Together they
;; provide tree-sitter integration for Emacs.  This file contains
;; convenient functions that are more idiomatic and flexible than the
;; exposed C API of tree-sitter.  It also contains frameworks for
;; integrating tree-sitter with font-lock, indentation, activating and
;; deactivating tree-sitter, debugging tree-sitter, etc.
;;
;; Some conventions:
;;
;; 1. Whenever it makes sense, a function that takes a tree-sitter node
;; as an argument should also accept nil (and return nil in that case).
;; This is to help with function chaining.
;;
;; 2. In most cases, a function shouldn't implicitly create a parser.
;; All parsers should be created explicitly by user.  Use
;;
;;     (car (treesit-parser-list nil LANG))
;;
;; to get a parser for a certain language.
;;
;; Initially in Emacs 29, the world is simple and each language has one
;; parser in the buffer.  So if we need a parser for a language, we can
;; just create it if it doesn't exist.  But now we have local parsers,
;; so there will be more than one parser for each language in a buffer.
;; We can also have local parser of the same language as the host
;; parser.  All of which means we can't equalize language and parser,
;; and create parser for a language willy-nilly anymore.  Major mode
;; will manage their parsers.

;; (ref:local-parser-overlay) Regarding local parser overlays, we store
;; the local parser in an overlay spanning across the code block for

;; the parser, the `treesit-host-parser' property stores the host parser,
;; the `treesit-parser-ov-timestamp' property stores the buffer's tick
;; counter (`buffer-modified-tick') when we last updated this overlay,
;; which is used for garbage-collecting stale ranges and local parsers.
;;
;; Besides local parsers, we also create overlays for non-local parsers,
;; just to mark the start and end of each range they parse, so that other
;; functions can make use of this information.  To differentiate the

;; the `treesit-parser-local-p' property set to non-nil.

(defvar-local treesit-range-settings nil
  "A list of range settings.

Each element of the list is of the form

    (QUERY LANGUAGE LOCAL-P OFFSET RANGE-FN)

When updating the range of each parser in the buffer,
`treesit-update-ranges' queries each QUERY, and sets LANGUAGE's range to
the range spanned by captured nodes.  QUERY must be a compiled query.
If LOCAL-P is t, give each range a separate local parser rather than
using a single parser for all the ranges.  If OFFSET is non-nil, it
should be a cons of numbers (START-OFFSET . END-OFFSET), where the start
and end offset are added to each queried range to get the result ranges.

If RANGE-FN is non-nil, it should be a function; Emacs uses this
function to compute the ranges to use for the embedded parser.  The
function is passed the captured node and OFFSET, and should return a
list of ranges, where each range is a cons of the start and end
position.

Capture names generally don't matter, but names that start with
an underscore are ignored.

QUERY can also be a function, in which case it is called with 2
arguments, START and END.  It should ensure parsers' ranges are
correct in the region between START and END.

The exact form of each setting is considered internal and subject
to change.  Use `treesit-range-rules' to set this variable.")

(defun treesit-range-rules (&rest query-specs)
  "Produce settings for `treesit-range-settings'.

QUERY-SPECS are a series of QUERY-SPECs, where each QUERY-SPEC is
a QUERY preceded by zero or more pairs of :KEYWORD and VALUE,
like this:

    :KEYWORD VALUE... QUERY

Each QUERY is a tree-sitter query in either the string,
s-expression or compiled form.

Capture names generally don't matter, but names that start with an
underscore are ignored.  The `@language' capture name is reserved.

For each QUERY, :KEYWORD and VALUE pairs add meta information to
it.  For example,

    (treesit-range-rules
     :embed \\='javascript
     :host \\='html
     :offset \\='(1 . -1)
     \\='((script_element (raw_text) @javascript)))

The `:embed' keyword specifies the embedded language, and the
`:host' keyword specifies the host language.  They are used in
this way: Emacs queries QUERY in the host language's parser,
computes the ranges spanned by the captured nodes, and applies
these ranges to parsers for the embedded language.

If the embed language is dynamic, then `:embed' can specify a
function.  This function will by passed a node and should return
the language symbol for the embedded code block.  The node is the one
captured from QUERY with capture name `@language'.  Also make sure the
code block and language capture are in the same match group.

If there's a `:local' keyword with value t, the range computed by
this QUERY is given a dedicated local parser.  Otherwise, the
range shares the same parser with other ranges.

If there's an `:offset' keyword with a pair of numbers, each
captured range is offset by those numbers.  For example, an
offset of (1 . -1) will update a captured range of (2 . 8) to
be (3 . 7).  This can be used to exclude things like surrounding
delimiters from being included in the range covered by an
embedded parser.

If there's a `:range-fn' keyword with a function, Emacs uses that
function to compute the ranges to use for the embedded parser.  The
function is passed the captured node and the offset given by the
`:offset' keyword, and should return a list of ranges, where each range
is a cons of the start and end position.

QUERY can also be a function that takes two arguments, START and
END.  If QUERY is a function, it doesn't need the :KEYWORD VALUE
pair preceding it.  This function should set the ranges for
parsers in the current buffer in the region between START and
END.  It is OK for this function to set ranges in a larger region
that encompasses the region between START and END."

Major modes categorize their fontification features into levels,

Level 1 usually contains only comments and definitions.
Level 2 usually adds keywords, strings, data types, etc.
Level 3 usually represents full-blown fontifications, including
assignments, constants, numbers and literals, etc.
Level 4 adds everything else that can be fontified: delimiters,
operators, brackets, punctuation, all functions, properties,

The value of this variable can be either a number representing a level,

Major mode is checked with `derived-mode-p'.

Changing the decoration level requires calling

   :KEYWORD VALUE... QUERY

QUERY is a tree-sitter query in either the string, s-expression
or compiled form.  For each query, captured nodes are highlighted
with the capture name as its face.

:KEYWORD and VALUE pairs preceding a QUERY add meta information
to QUERY.  For example,

     :override t
     :feature\\='constant
     \\='((true) @font-lock-constant-face

     :language \\='html
     :feature \\='script
     \"(script_element) @font-lock-builtin-face\")

For each QUERY, a :language keyword and a :feature keyword are
required.  Each query's :feature is a symbol summarizing what the
query fontifies.  It is used to allow users to enable/disable
certain features.  See `treesit-font-lock-feature-list' for more.
Other keywords include:

  KEYWORD    VALUE      DESCRIPTION

                               will use LANGUAGE by default.

Capture names in QUERY should be face names like
`font-lock-keyword-face'.  The captured node will be fontified
with that face.

Capture names can also be function names, in which case the
function will be called with the following argument list:

    (NODE OVERRIDE START END &rest _)

where NODE is the tree-sitter node object, OVERRIDE is the
override option of that rule, and START and END specify the region
to be fontified.  This function should accept more arguments as
optional arguments for future extensibility, and it shouldn't
fontify text outside the region given by START and END.

If a capture name is both a face and a function, the face takes
priority.  If a capture name is not a face name nor a function
name, it is ignored."

;; Some details worth explaining:
;;
;; 1. When we apply face to a node, we clip the face into the
;; currently fontifying region, this way we don't overwrite faces
;; applied by regexp-based font-lock.  The clipped part will be
;; fontified fine when Emacs fontifies the region containing it.
;;
;; 2. If you insert an ending quote into a buffer, jit-lock only wants
;; to fontify that single quote, and (treesit-node-on start end) will
;; give you that quote node.  We want to capture the string and apply
;; string face to it, but querying on the quote node will not give us
;; the string node.  So we don't use treesit-node-on: using the root
;; node with a restricted range is very fast anyway (even in large
;; files of size ~10MB).  Plus, querying the result of
;; `treesit-node-on' could still miss patterns even if we use some
;; heuristic to enlarge the node (how much to enlarge? to which
;; extent?), it's much safer to just use the root node.
;;
;; Sometimes the source file has some errors that cause tree-sitter to
;; parse it into a enormously tall tree (10k levels tall).  In that
;; case querying the root node is very slow.  So we try to get
;; top-level nodes and query them.  This ensures that querying is fast
;; everywhere else, except for the problematic region.  (Bug#59415).
;;
;; Some other time the source file has a top-level node that contains
;; a huge number of immediate children (say, 10k children), querying
;; that node is also very slow, so instead of getting the top-level
;; node, we recursively go down the tree to find nodes that cover the
;; region but are reasonably small.  (Bug#59738).
;;
;; 3. It is possible to capture a node that's completely outside the
;; region between START and END: as long as the whole pattern
;; intersects the region, all the captured nodes in that pattern are
;; returned.  If the node is outside of that region, (max node-start
;; start) and friends return bad values, so we filter them out.
;; However, we don't filter these nodes out if a function will process
;; the node, because it could (and often do) fontify the relatives of
;; the captured node, not just the node itself.  If we took out those
;; nodes author of those functions would be very confused.

Each indent rule setting should be (LANGUAGE RULE...), where LANGUAGE is

MATCHER determines whether this rule applies, ANCHOR and
OFFSET together determines which column to indent to.

A MATCHER is a function that takes three arguments (NODE PARENT
BOL).  BOL is the point where we are indenting: the beginning of
line content, the position of the first non-whitespace character.
NODE is the largest (highest-in-tree) node starting at that
point.  PARENT is the parent of NODE.

If MATCHER returns non-nil, meaning the rule matches, Emacs then
uses ANCHOR to find an anchor, it should be a function that takes
the same argument (NODE PARENT BOL) and returns a point.

Finally Emacs computes the column of that point returned by
ANCHOR and adds OFFSET to it, and indents to that column.  OFFSET
can be an integer or a variable whose value is an integer.

For MATCHER and ANCHOR, Emacs provides some convenient presets.
See `treesit-simple-indent-presets'.

For complex cases, a RULE can also be a single function.  This function
should take the same argument as MATCHER or ANCHOR.  If it matches,
return a cons (ANCHOR-POS . OFFSET), where ANCHOR-POS is a position and
OFFSET is the indent offset; if it doesn't match, return nil.")

  "A list of indent rule presets.
These presets can be used as MATCHER and ANCHOR values in
`treesit-simple-indent-rules'.  MATCHERs and ANCHORs are
functions that take 3 arguments: NODE, PARENT, and BOL.

MATCHER:

\(match NODE-TYPE PARENT-TYPE NODE-FIELD NODE-INDEX-MIN NODE-INDEX-MAX)

    NODE-TYPE checks for NODE's type, PARENT-TYPE checks for
    PARENT's type, NODE-FIELD checks for the field name of NODE
    in PARENT, NODE-INDEX-MIN and NODE-INDEX-MAX check for
    NODE's index in PARENT.  Therefore, to match the first child
    where PARENT is \"argument_list\", use

        (match nil \"argument_list\" nil 0 0).

    NODE-TYPE, PARENT-TYPE, and NODE-FIELD are regexps.
    NODE-TYPE can also be `null', which matches when NODE is nil.

no-node

    Matches the case where NODE is nil, i.e., there is no node
    that starts at point.  This is the case when indenting an
    empty line.

\(parent-is TYPE)

    Check that PARENT's type matches regexp TYPE.

\(node-is TYPE)

    Checks that NODE's type matches regexp TYPE.

\(field-is NAME)

    Checks that NODE's field name in PARENT matches regexp NAME.

\(n-p-gp NODE-TYPE PARENT-TYPE GRANDPARENT-TYPE)

    Checks for NODE's, its parent's, and its grandparent's type.

\(query QUERY)

    Queries PARENT with QUERY, and checks if NODE is
    captured (by any capture name).

comment-end

    Matches if text after point matches `comment-end-skip'.

catch-all

    Always matches.

ANCHOR:

first-sibling

    Returns the start of the first child of PARENT.

\(nth-sibling N &optional NAMED)

    Returns the start of the Nth child of PARENT.
    NAMED non-nil means count only named nodes.

parent

    Returns the start of PARENT.

grand-parent

    Returns the start of PARENT's parent.

great-grand-parent

    Returns the start of PARENT's parent's parent.

parent-bol

    Returns the beginning of non-space characters on the line where
    PARENT is on.

standalone-parent

    Finds the first ancestor node (parent, grandparent, etc.) that
    starts on its own line, and returns the start of that node.  The
    definition of \"standalone\" can be customized by setting
    `treesit-simple-indent-standalone-predicate'.  Some major mode might
    want to do that for easier indentation for method chaining.

prev-sibling

    Returns the start of NODE's previous sibling.

no-indent

    Returns the start of NODE.

prev-line

    Returns the first non-whitespace character on the previous line.

column-0

    Returns the beginning of the current line, which is at column 0.

comment-start

    Goes to the position that `comment-start-skip' would return,
    skips whitespace backwards, and returns the resulting
    position.  Assumes PARENT is a comment node.

prev-adaptive-prefix

    Goes to the beginning of previous non-empty line, and tries
    to match `adaptive-fill-regexp'.  If it matches, return the
    end of the match, otherwise return nil.  However, if the
    current line begins with a prefix, return the beginning of
    the prefix of the previous line instead, so that the two
    prefixes aligns.  This is useful for an `indent-relative'-like
    indent behavior for block comments.")

;;    -> Obviously we don't want to go to parent's end, instead, we
;;       want to go to parent's prev-sibling's end.  Again, we recurse

move to the parent if there is one; and move to siblings if there's no

Only LANG and URL are mandatory.  LANG is the language symbol.
URL is the URL of the grammar's Git repository or a directory

REVISION is the Git tag or branch of the desired version, defaulting to
the latest default branch.  If COMMIT is non-nil, checkout this commit
hash after cloning the repo.  COMMIT has precedence over REVISION if
both are non-nil.

SOURCE-DIR is the relative subdirectory in the repository in which
the grammar's parser.c file resides, defaulting to \"src\".

CC and C++ are C and C++ compilers, defaulting to \"cc\" and
\"c++\", respectively.

Another way to specify optional data is to use keywords:

    (LANG . (URL [KEYWORD VALUE]...))

The currently supported keywords:

`:revision' is the same as REVISION above.
`:source-dir' is the same as SOURCE-DIR above.
`:cc' is the same as CC above.
`:c++' is the same as C++ above.
`:commit' is the same as COMMIT above.
