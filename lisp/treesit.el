;;; Commentary:

;; This file is the Lisp counterpart of treesit.c.  Together they
;; provide tree-sitter integration for Emacs.  This file contains
;; convenient functions that are more idiomatic and flexible than the
;; exposed C API of tree-sitter.  It also contains frameworks for
;; integrating tree-sitter with font-lock, indentation, activating and
;; deactivating tree-sitter, debugging tree-sitter, etc.

QUERY-SPECS are a series of QUERY-SPECs, where each QUERY-SPEC is

like this:

    :KEYWORD VALUE... QUERY

Each QUERY is a tree-sitter query in either the string,
s-expression or compiled form.

it.  For example,

    (treesit-range-rules

The `:embed' keyword specifies the embedded language, and the
`:host' keyword specifies the host language.  They are used in
this way: Emacs queries QUERY in the host language's parser,
computes the ranges spanned by the captured nodes, and applies
these ranges to parsers for the embedded language.

QUERY can also be a function that takes two arguments, START and
END.  If QUERY is a function, it doesn't need the :KEYWORD VALUE
pair preceding it.  This function should set the ranges for
parsers in the current buffer in the region between START and

Major modes categorize their fontification features into levels,

Level 1 usually contains only comments and definitions.
Level 2 usually adds keywords, strings, data types, etc.
Level 3 usually represents full-blown fontifications, including
assignments, constants, numbers and literals, etc.
Level 4 adds everything else that can be fontified: delimiters,
operators, brackets, punctuation, all functions, properties,
variables, etc.

In addition to the decoration level, individual features can be
turned on/off by calling `treesit-font-lock-recompute-features'.
Changing the decoration level requires calling
`treesit-font-lock-recompute-features' to have an effect, unless
done via `customize-variable'.

QUERY-SPECS is a series of QUERY-SPECs.  Each QUERY-SPEC is a
QUERY preceded by multiple pairs of :KEYWORD and VALUE:

   :KEYWORD VALUE... QUERY

QUERY is a tree-sitter query in either the string, s-expression
or compiled form.  For each query, captured nodes are highlighted
with the capture name as its face.

:KEYWORD and VALUE pairs preceding a QUERY add meta information
to QUERY.  For example,

    (treesit-font-lock-rules
     :language \\='javascript
     :override t
     :feature\\='constant
     \\='((true) @font-lock-constant-face
       (false) @font-lock-constant-face)
     :language \\='html
     :feature \\='script
     \"(script_element) @font-lock-builtin-face\")

For each QUERY, a :language keyword and a :feature keyword are
required.  Each query's :feature is a symbol summarizing what the
query fontifies.  It is used to allow users to enable/disable
certain features.  See `treesit-font-lock-feature-list' for more.
Other keywords include:

  KEYWORD    VALUE      DESCRIPTION
  :override  nil        If the region already has a face,
                        discard the new face.
             t          Always apply the new face.
             `append'   Append the new face to existing ones.
             `prepend'  Prepend the new face to existing ones.
             `keep'     Fill-in regions without an existing face.

Capture names in QUERY should be face names like
`font-lock-keyword-face'.  The captured node will be fontified
with that face.

Capture names can also be function names, in which case the
function will be called with the following argument list:

    (NODE OVERRIDE START END &rest _)

where NODE is the tree-sitter node object, OVERRIDE is the
override option of that rule, and START and END specify the region
to be fontified.  This function should accept more arguments as
optional arguments for future extensibility, and it shouldn't
fontify text outside the region given by START and END.

If a capture name is both a face and a function, the face takes
priority.  If a capture name is not a face name nor a function
name, it is ignored."

;; Some details worth explaining:
;;
;; 1. When we apply face to a node, we clip the face into the
;; currently fontifying region, this way we don't overwrite faces
;; applied by regexp-based font-lock.  The clipped part will be
;; fontified fine when Emacs fontifies the region containing it.
;;
;; 2. If you insert an ending quote into a buffer, jit-lock only wants
;; to fontify that single quote, and (treesit-node-on start end) will
;; give you that quote node.  We want to capture the string and apply
;; string face to it, but querying on the quote node will not give us
;; the string node.  So we don't use treesit-node-on: using the root
;; node with a restricted range is very fast anyway (even in large
;; files of size ~10MB).  Plus, querying the result of
;; `treesit-node-on' could still miss patterns even if we use some
;; heuristic to enlarge the node (how much to enlarge? to which
;; extent?), it's much safer to just use the root node.
;;
;; Sometimes the source file has some errors that cause tree-sitter to
;; parse it into a enormously tall tree (10k levels tall).  In that
;; case querying the root node is very slow.  So we try to get
;; top-level nodes and query them.  This ensures that querying is fast
;; everywhere else, except for the problematic region.  (Bug#59415).
;;
;; Some other time the source file has a top-level node that contains
;; a huge number of immediate children (say, 10k children), querying
;; that node is also very slow, so instead of getting the top-level
;; node, we recursively go down the tree to find nodes that cover the
;; region but are reasonably small.  (Bug#59738).
;;
;; 3. It is possible to capture a node that's completely outside the
;; region between START and END: as long as the whole pattern
;; intersects the region, all the captured nodes in that pattern are
;; returned.  If the node is outside of that region, (max node-start
;; start) and friends return bad values, so we filter them out.
;; However, we don't filter these nodes out if a function will process
;; the node, because it could (and often do) fontify the relatives of
;; the captured node, not just the node itself.  If we took out those
;; nodes author of those functions would be very confused.

Each indent rule setting should be (LANGUAGE . RULES),
where LANGUAGE is a language symbol, and RULES is a list of

    (MATCHER ANCHOR OFFSET).

MATCHER determines whether this rule applies, ANCHOR and OFFSET
together determines which column to indent to.

A MATCHER is a function that takes three arguments (NODE PARENT
BOL).  BOL is the point where we are indenting: the beginning of
line content, the position of the first non-whitespace character.
NODE is the largest (highest-in-tree) node starting at that
point.  PARENT is the parent of NODE.

If MATCHER returns non-nil, meaning the rule matches, Emacs then
uses ANCHOR to find an anchor, it should be a function that takes
the same argument (NODE PARENT BOL) and returns a point.

Finally Emacs computes the column of that point returned by
ANCHOR and adds OFFSET to it, and indents to that column.  OFFSET
can be an integer or a variable whose value is an integer.

For MATCHER and ANCHOR, Emacs provides some convenient presets.
See `treesit-simple-indent-presets'.")

  "A list of presets.
These presets that can be used as MATHER and ANCHOR in
`treesit-simple-indent-rules'.  MACHTERs and ANCHORs are
functions that take 3 arguments: NODE, PARENT and BOL.

MATCHER:

\(match NODE-TYPE PARENT-TYPE NODE-FIELD NODE-INDEX-MIN NODE-INDEX-MAX)

    NODE-TYPE checks for NODE's type, PARENT-TYPE checks for
    PARENT's type, NODE-FIELD checks for the field name of NODE
    in PARENT, NODE-INDEX-MIN and NODE-INDEX-MAX check for
    NODE's index in PARENT.  Therefore, to match the first child
    where PARENT is \"argument_list\", use

        (match nil \"argument_list\" nil nil 0 0).

    NODE-TYPE, PARENT-TYPE, and NODE-FIELD are regexps.

no-node

    Matches the case where NODE is nil, i.e., there is no node
    that starts at point.  This is the case when indenting an
    empty line.

\(parent-is TYPE)

    Check that PARENT's type matches regexp TYPE.

\(node-is TYPE)

    Checks that NODE's type matches regexp TYPE.

\(n-p-gp NODE-TYPE PARENT-TYPE GRANDPARENT-TYPE)

    Checks for NODE's, its parent's, and its grandparent's type.

\(query QUERY)

    Queries PARENT with QUERY, and checks if NODE is
    captured (by any capture name).

comment-end

    Matches if text after point matches `treesit-comment-end'.

ANCHOR:

first-sibling

    Returns the start of the first child of PARENT.

parent

    Returns the start of PARENT.

parent-bol

    Returns the beginning of non-space characters on the line where
    PARENT is on.

standalone-parent

    Finds the first ancestor node (parent, grandparent, etc) that
    starts on its own line, and return the start of that node.

prev-sibling

    Returns the start of NODE's previous sibling.

no-indent

    Returns the start of NODE.

prev-line

    Returns the first non-whitespace character on the previous line.

point-min

    Returns the beginning of buffer, which is always at column 0.

comment-start

    Goes to the position that `comment-start-skip' would return,
    skips whitespace backwards, and returns the resulting
    position.  Assumes PARENT is a comment node.

prev-adaptive-prefix

    Goes to the beginning of previous non-empty line, and tries
    to match `adaptive-fill-regexp'.  If it matches, return the
    end of the match, otherwise return nil.  However, if the
    current line begins with a prefix, return the beginning of
    the prefix of the previous line instead, so that the two
    prefixes aligns.  This is useful for a `indent-relative'-like
    indent behavior for block comments.")
