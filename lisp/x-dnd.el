(defcustom x-dnd-test-function #'x-dnd-default-test-function
  "The function drag and drop uses to determine if to accept or reject a drop.
The function takes three arguments, WINDOW, ACTION and TYPES.
WINDOW is where the mouse is when the function is called.  WINDOW
may be a frame if the mouse isn't over a real window (i.e. menu
bar, tool bar or scroll bar).  ACTION is the suggested action
from the drag and drop source, one of the symbols move, copy,
link or ask.  TYPES is a vector of available types for the drop.

Each element of TYPE should either be a string (containing the
name of the type's X atom), or a symbol, whose name will be used.

The function shall return nil to reject the drop or a cons with
two values, the wanted action as car and the wanted type as cdr.
The wanted action can be copy, move, link, ask or private.

The default value for this variable is `x-dnd-default-test-function'."
