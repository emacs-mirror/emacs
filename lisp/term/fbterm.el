;; Note that, in some versions of fbterm, the TERM environment
;; variable is set to "linux".  When that's the case, the code below
;; will not be executed, and only 8 colors will be available.  It is
;; therefore necessary, with these versions of fbterm, to set that
;; environment variable to "fbterm" to enable its 256 color mode
;; extension.  See also the node "Emacs in a Linux console" of the
;; Emacs FAQ.
