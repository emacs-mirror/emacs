;;; Commentary:

;; w32-win.el:  this file is loaded from ../lisp/startup.el when it recognizes
;; that W32 windows are to be used.  Command line switches are parsed and those
;; pertaining to W32 are processed and removed from the command line.  The
;; W32 display is opened and hooks are set for popping up the initial window.

;; startup.el will then examine startup files, and eventually call the hooks
;; which create the first window (s).

;;; Code:


;; These are the standard X switches from the Xt Initialize.c file of
;; Release 4.

  "List of Unicode subranges whose support cannot be announced by a font.
The FONTSIGNATURE structure reported by MS-Windows for a font
includes 123 Unicode Subset bits (USBs) to identify subranges of
the Unicode codepoint space supported by the font.  Since the
number of bits is fixed, not every Unicode block can have a
corresponding USB bit; fonts that support characters from blocks
that have no USBs cannot communicate their support to Emacs,
unless the font is opened and physically tested for glyphs for
characters from these blocks.")
