;;; Commentary:

;; w32-win.el:  this file is loaded from ../lisp/startup.el when it recognizes
;; that W32 windows are to be used.  Command line switches are parsed and those
;; pertaining to W32 are processed and removed from the command line.  The
;; W32 display is opened and hooks are set for popping up the initial window.

;; startup.el will then examine startup files, and eventually call the hooks
;; which create the first window (s).

;;; Code:


;; These are the standard X switches from the Xt Initialize.c file of
;; Release 4.
