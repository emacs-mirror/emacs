;;; Commentary:

;; This enables the use of the mouse wheel (or scroll wheel) in Emacs.
;; Under X11/X.Org, the wheel events are sent as button4/button5
;; events.

;; Mouse wheel support is already enabled by default on most graphical
;; displays.  You can toggle it using `M-x mouse-wheel-mode'.

;;; Code:

;; Implementation note:
;;
;; I for one would prefer some way of converting the button4/button5
;; events into different event types, like 'mwheel-up' or
;; 'mwheel-down', but I cannot find a way to do this very easily (or
;; portably), so for now I just live with it.
