;;; Commentary:

;; This enables the use of the mouse wheel (or scroll wheel) in Emacs.
;; Under X11/X.Org, the wheel events are sent as mouse-4/mouse-5
;; events.

;; Mouse wheel support is already enabled by default on most graphical
;; displays.  You can toggle it using `M-x mouse-wheel-mode'.

;;; Code:

;; Implementation note:
;;
;; I for one would prefer some way of converting the mouse-4/mouse-5
;; events into different event types, like 'mwheel-up' or
;; 'mwheel-down', but I cannot find a way to do this very easily (or
;; portably), so for now I just live with it.

This is an alist mapping the modifier key to the amount to scroll when

Elements of the list have the form (MODIFIER . AMOUNT) or just AMOUNT if
MODIFIER is nil.

AMOUNT should be the number of lines to scroll, or nil for near full
screen.  It can also be a floating point number, specifying the fraction of
a full screen to scroll.  A near full screen is `next-screen-context-lines'
less than a full screen.

If AMOUNT is the symbol `hscroll', this means that with MODIFIER,
the mouse wheel will scroll horizontally instead of vertically.

If AMOUNT is the symbol `text-scale' or `global-text-scale', this
means that with MODIFIER, the mouse wheel will change the font size
instead of scrolling (by adjusting the font height of the default
face, either locally in the buffer or globally).  For more
