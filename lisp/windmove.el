;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This package defines a set of routines, windmove-{left,up,right,
;; down}, for selection of windows in a frame geometrically.  For
;; example, `windmove-right' selects the window immediately to the
;; right of the currently-selected one.  This functionality is similar
;; to the window-selection controls of the BRIEF editor of yore.
;;
;; One subtle point is what happens when the window to the right has
;; been split vertically; for example, consider a call to
;; `windmove-right' in this setup:
;;
;;                    -------------
;;                    |      | A  |
;;                    |      |    |
;;                    |      |-----
;;                    | *    |    |    (* is point in the currently
;;                    |      | B  |     selected window)
;;                    |      |    |
;;                    -------------
;;
;; There are (at least) three reasonable things to do:
;; (1) Always move to the window to the right of the top edge of the
;;     selected window; in this case, this policy selects A.
;; (2) Always move to the window to the right of the bottom edge of
;;     the selected window; in this case, this policy selects B.
;; (3) Move to the window to the right of point in the selected
;;     window.  This may select either A or B, depending on the
;;     position of point; in the illustrated example, it would select
;;     B.
;;
;; Similar issues arise for all the movement functions.  Windmove
;; resolves this problem by allowing the user to specify behavior
;; through a prefix argument.  The cases are thus:
;; * if no argument is given to the movement functions, or the
;;   argument given is zero, movement is relative to point;
;; * if a positive argument is given, movement is relative to the top
;;   or left edge of the selected window, depending on whether the
;;   movement is to be horizontal or vertical;
;; * if a negative argument is given, movement is relative to the
;;   bottom or right edge of the selected window, depending on whether
;;   the movement is to be horizontal or vertical.
;;
;;
;; Another feature enables wrap-around mode when the variable
;; `windmove-wrap-around' is set to a non-nil value.  In this mode,
;; movement that falls off the edge of the frame will wrap around to
;; find the window on the opposite side of the frame.  Windmove does
;; the Right Thing about the minibuffer; for example, consider:
;;
;;                    -------------
;;                    |    *      |
;;                    |-----------|
;;                    |     A     |
;;                    |-----------|    (* is point in the currently
;;                    |  B   | C  |     selected window)
;;                    |      |    |
;;                    -------------
;;
;; With wraparound enabled, windmove-down will move to A, while
;; windmove-up will move to the minibuffer if it is active, or to
;; either B or C depending on the prefix argument.
;;
;;
;; A set of default keybindings is supplied: shift-{left,up,right,down}
;; invoke the corresponding Windmove function.  See the installation
;; section if you wish to use these keybindings.


;; Installation:
;;
;; Put the following line in your init file:
;;
;;     (windmove-default-keybindings)         ; shifted arrow keys
;;
;; or
;;
;;     (windmove-default-keybindings 'hyper)  ; etc.
;;
;; to use another modifier key.
;;
;;
;; If you wish to enable wrap-around, also add a line like:
;;
;;    (setq windmove-wrap-around t)
;;

;; inspiration for it.  Kin Cho (kin@symmetrycomm.com) was the first
