;;; Commentary:

;; This code helps GNU Emacs maintainers keep the loaddefs.el file up to
;; date.  It interprets magic cookies of the form ";;;###autoload" in
;; Lisp source files in various useful ways.  To learn more, read the
;; source; if you're going to use this, you'd better be able to.

;; The functions in this file have been superseded by loaddefs-gen.el.

;; Note: When removing this file, also remove the references to
;; `make-directory-autoloads' and `update-directory-autoloads' in
;; subr.el.

;;; Code:

(require 'lisp-mode)			;for `doc-string-elt' properties.
(require 'lisp-mnt)
(require 'cl-lib)
(require 'loaddefs-gen)

;; This feels like it should be a defconst, but MH-E sets it to
;; ";;;###mh-autoload" for the autoloads that are to go into mh-loaddefs.el.
(defvar generate-autoload-cookie ";;;###autoload"
  "Magic comment indicating the following form should be autoloaded.
Used by \\[update-file-autoloads].  This string should be
meaningless to Lisp (e.g., a comment).

This string is used:

\;;;###autoload
\(defun function-to-be-autoloaded () ...)

If this string appears alone on a line, the following form will be
read and an autoload made for it.  If there is further text on the line,
that text will be copied verbatim to `generated-autoload-file'.")

(defvar autoload-timestamps nil		; experimental, see bug#22213
  "Non-nil means insert a timestamp for each input file into the output.
We use these in incremental updates of the output file to decide
if we need to rescan an input file.  If you set this to nil,
then we use the timestamp of the output file instead.  As a result:
 - for fixed inputs, the output will be the same every time
 - incremental updates of the output file might not be correct if:
   i) the timestamp of the output file cannot be trusted (at least
     relative to that of the input files)
   ii) any of the input files can be modified during the time it takes
      to create the output
   iii) only a subset of the input files are scanned
   These issues are unlikely to happen in practice, and would arguably
   represent bugs in the build system.  Item iii) will happen if you
   use a command like `update-file-autoloads', though, since it only
   checks a single input file.")
