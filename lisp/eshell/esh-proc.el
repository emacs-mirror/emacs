This variable sets the buffer-local value of `delete-exited-processes'

This variable causes Eshell to mimic the behavior of bash when set to
nil.  It allows the user to view the exit status of a completed subjob
\(process) at their leisure, because the process entry remains in
memory until the user examines it using \\[list-processes].

Otherwise, if `eshell-done-messages-in-minibuffer' is nil, and this
variable is set to t, the only indication the user will have that a
subjob is done is that it will no longer appear in the
\\[list-processes\\] display.
