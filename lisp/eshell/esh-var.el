;;; Commentary:

;; These are the possible variable interpolation syntaxes.  Also keep
;; in mind that if an argument looks like a number, it will be
;; converted to a number.  This is not significant when invoking
;; external commands, but it's important when calling Lisp functions.
;;
;;   $VARIABLE
;;
;; Interval the value of an environment variable, or a Lisp variable
;;
;;   $ALSO-VAR
;;
;; "-" is a valid part of a variable name.
;;
;;   $\"MYVAR\"-TOO
;;   $'MYVAR'-TOO
;;
;; Only "MYVAR" is part of the variable name in this case.
;;
;;   $(lisp)
;;
;; Returns result of Lisp evaluation.  Note: Used alone like this, it
;; is identical to just saying (lisp); but with the variable expansion
;; form, the result may be interpolated a larger string, such as
;; '$(lisp)/other'.
;;
;;   ${command}
;;
;; Returns the value of an eshell subcommand.  See the note above
;; regarding Lisp evaluations.
;;
;;   $<command>
;;
;; Evaluates an eshell subcommand, redirecting the output to a
;; temporary file, and returning the file name.
;;
;;   $EXPR[10]
;;
;; Return the 10th element of $EXPR, which can be any dollar
;; expression.  If $EXPR's value is a string, it will be split in
;; order to make it a list.  The splitting will occur at whitespace.
;;
;;   $EXPR[10 20]
;;
;; As above, but instead of returning a single element, it now returns a
;; list of two elements.
;;
;;   $EXPR[: 10]
;;
;; Like $EXPR[10], except that splitting occurs at the colon now.
;;
;;   $EXPR["\\\\" 10]
;;
;; Separate on backslash characters.  Actually, the first argument --
;; if it doesn't have the form of a number -- can be any regular
;; expression.  So to split on numbers, use '$EXPR["[0-9]+" 10 20]'.
;;
;;   $EXPR[hello]
;;
;; Calls `assoc' on $EXPR with 'hello', expecting it to be an alist.
;;
;;   $#EXPR
;;
;; Returns the length of the value of $EXPR.  This could also be
;; done using the `length' Lisp function.
;;
;;   $@EXPR
;;
;; Splices the value of $EXPR in-place into the current list of
;; arguments.  This is analogous to the `,@' token in Elisp
;; backquotes, and works as if the user typed '$EXPR[0] $EXPR[1]
;; ... $EXPR[N]'.
;;
;; There are also a few special variables defined by Eshell.  '$$' is
;; the value of the last command (t or nil, in the case of an external
;; command).  This makes it possible to chain results:
;;
;;   /tmp $ echo /var/spool/mail/johnw
;;   /var/spool/mail/johnw
;;   /tmp $ dirname $$
;;   /var/spool/mail/
;;   /tmp $ cd $$
;;   /var/spool/mail $
;;
;; '$_' refers to the last argument of the last command.  And $?
;; contains the exit code of the last command (0 or 1 for Lisp
;; functions, based on successful completion).

  "This list provides aliasing for variable references.
Each member is of the following form:

  (NAME VALUE [COPY-TO-ENVIRONMENT] [SIMPLE-FUNCTION])

NAME defines the name of the variable, VALUE is a Lisp value used to
compute the string value that will be returned when the variable is
accessed via the syntax `$NAME'.

If VALUE is a cons (GET . SET), then variable references to NAME
will use GET to get the value, and SET to set it.  GET and SET
can be one of the forms described below.  If SET is nil, the
variable is read-only.

If VALUE is a function, its behavior depends on the value of
SIMPLE-FUNCTION.  If SIMPLE-FUNCTION is nil, call VALUE with two
arguments: the list of the indices that were used in the reference,
and either t or nil depending on whether or not the variable was
quoted with double quotes.  For example, if `NAME' were aliased
to a function, a reference of `$NAME[10][20]' would result in that
function being called with the arguments `((\"10\") (\"20\"))' and
nil.  If SIMPLE-FUNCTION is non-nil, call the function with no
arguments and then pass its return value to `eshell-apply-indices'.

When VALUE is a function, it's read-only by default.  To make it
writable, use the (GET . SET) form described above.  If SET is a
function, it takes two arguments: a list of indices (currently
always nil, but reserved for future enhancement), and the new
value to set.

If VALUE is a string, get/set the value for the variable with
that name in the current environment.  When getting the value, if
no variable with that name exists in the environment, but if a
symbol with that same name exists and has a value bound to it,
return that symbol's value instead.  You can prefer symbol values
over environment values by setting the value of
`eshell-prefer-lisp-variables' to t.

If VALUE is a symbol, get/set the value bound to it.

If VALUE has any other type, signal an error.

Additionally, if COPY-TO-ENVIRONMENT is non-nil, the alias should be
copied (a.k.a. \"exported\") to the environment of created subprocesses."

The format of INDICES is:

Each member of INDICES represents a level of nesting.  If the first
member of a sublist is not an integer or name, and the value it's
referencing is a string, that will be used as the regexp with which
is to divide the string into sub-parts.  The default is whitespace.
Otherwise, each INT-OR-NAME refers to an element of the list value.
Integers imply a direct index, and names, an associate lookup using
`assoc'.

If QUOTED is non-nil, this was invoked inside double-quotes.
This affects the behavior of splitting strings: without quoting,
the split values are converted to numbers via
`eshell-convert-to-number' if possible; with quoting, they're
left as strings.

'/etc/passwd', the variable reference would look like:
