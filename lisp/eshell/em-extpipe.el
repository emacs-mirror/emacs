;;; Commentary:

;; When constructing shell pipelines that will move a lot of data, it
;; is a good idea to bypass Eshell's own pipelining support and use
;; the operating system shell's instead.  This module tries to make
;; that easy to do.

;;; Code:

(require 'cl-lib)
(require 'esh-arg)
(require 'esh-cmd)
(require 'esh-io)
(require 'esh-util)

(eval-when-compile (require 'files-x))

  "Native shell pipelines.

This module lets you construct pipelines that use your operating
system's shell instead of Eshell's own pipelining support.  This
is especially relevant when executing commands on a remote
machine using Eshell's Tramp integration: using the remote
shell's pipelining avoids copying the data which will flow
through the pipeline to local Emacs buffers and then right back
again."

  "Parse a pipeline intended for execution by the external shell.

A sequence of arguments is rewritten to use the operating system
shell when it contains `*|', `*<' or `*>', where the asterisk is
preceded by whitespace or located at the start of input.

The command extends to the next `|' character which is not
preceded by an unescaped asterisk following whitespace, or the
end of input, except that any Eshell-specific output redirections
occurring at the end are excluded.  Any other `<' or `>'
appearing before the end of the command are treated as though
preceded by (whitespace and) an asterisk.

For example,

    foo <bar *| baz >#<buffer quux>

is equivalent to

    sh -c \"foo <bar | baz\" >#<buffer quux>

when `shell-file-name' is `sh' and `shell-command-switch' is
`-c', but in

    foo >#<buffer quux> *| baz

and

    foo *| baz >#<buffer quux> --some-argument

the Eshell-specific redirect will be passed on to the operating
system shell, probably leading to undesired results.

This function must appear early in `eshell-parse-argument-hook'
to ensure that operating system shell syntax is not interpreted
as though it were Eshell syntax."
  ;; Our goal is to wrap the external command to protect it from the
  ;; other members of `eshell-parse-argument-hook'.  We must avoid
  ;; misinterpreting a quoted `*|', `*<' or `*>' as indicating an
  ;; external pipeline, hence the structure of the loop in `findbeg1'.
