;;; Commentary:

;; The globbing code used by Eshell closely follows the syntax used by
;; zsh.  Basically, here is a summary of examples:
;;
;;   echo a*       ; anything starting with 'a'
;;   echo a#b      ; zero or more 'a's, then 'b'
;;   echo a##b     ; one or more 'a's, then 'b'
;;   echo a?       ; a followed by any character
;;   echo a*~ab    ; 'a', then anything, but not 'ab'
;;   echo c*~*~    ; all files beginning with 'c', except backups (*~)
;;
;; Recursive globbing is also supported:
;;
;;   echo **/*.c   ; all '.c' files at or under current directory
;;   echo ***/*.c  ; same as above, but traverse symbolic links
;;
;; Using argument predication, the recursive globbing syntax is
;; sufficient to replace the use of 'find <expr> | xargs <cmd>' in
;; most cases.  For example, to change the readership of all files
;; belonging to 'johnw' in the '/tmp' directory or lower, use:
;;
;;   chmod go-r /tmp/**/*(u'johnw')
;;
;; The glob above matches all of the files beneath '/tmp' that are
;; owned by the user 'johnw'.  See [Value modifiers and predicates],
;; for more information about argument predication.
