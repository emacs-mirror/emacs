  "Electric forward slash in remote Eshells.

This module helps with supplying absolute file name arguments to
remote commands.  After enabling it, typing a forward slash as
the first character of a command line argument will automatically
insert the Tramp prefix, /method:host:.  The automatic insertion
applies only when `default-directory' is remote and the command
is a Lisp function.

The result is that in most cases of supplying absolute file name
arguments to commands you should see the Tramp prefix inserted
automatically only when that's what you'd reasonably expect.
This frees you from having to keep track of whether commands are
Lisp functions or external when typing command line arguments."
