;;; Commentary:

;; There are very few basic Eshell commands -- so-called builtins.
;; They are: echo, umask, and version.
;;
;;;_* `echo'
;;
;; The `echo' command repeats its arguments to the screen.  It is
;; optional whether this is done in a Lisp-friendly fashion (so that
;; the value of echo is useful to a Lisp command using the result of
;; echo as an argument), or whether it should try to act like a normal
;; shell echo, and always result in a flat string being returned.

;; An example of the difference is the following:
;;
;;   echo Hello world
;;
;; If `eshell-plain-echo-behavior' is non-nil, this will yield the
;; string "Hello world".  If Lisp behavior is enabled, however, it
;; will yield a list whose two elements are the strings "Hello" and
;; "world".  The way to write an equivalent expression for both would
;; be:
;;
;;   echo "Hello world"
;;
;; This always returns a single string.
;;
;;;_* `umask'
;;
;; The umask command changes the default file permissions for newly
;; created files.  It uses the same syntax as bash.
