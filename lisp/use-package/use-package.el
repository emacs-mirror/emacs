;;; Commentary:

;; The `use-package' declaration macro allows you to isolate package
;; configuration in your init file in a way that is
;; performance-oriented and, well, just tidy.  I created it because I
;; have over 80 packages that I use in Emacs, and things were getting
;; difficult to manage.  Yet with this utility my total load time is
;; just under 1 second, with no loss of functionality!
;;
;; See the `use-package' info manual for more information.

;;; Code:

(require 'use-package-core)

(require 'use-package-bind-key)
(require 'use-package-diminish)
(require 'use-package-delight)
(require 'use-package-ensure)

(declare-function use-package-jump-to-package-form "use-package-jump")
(autoload #'use-package-jump-to-package-form "use-package-jump" nil t)

(provide 'use-package)

;;; use-package.el ends here
