;;; Commentary:

;; Provides the command `M-x use-package-jump-to-package-form'.  However, it
;; only works if the package being jumped to was required during
;; initialization.  If it was autoloaded, it will not work.
;; Improvements are needed.
;;
;; See the `use-package' info manual for more information.

(require 'use-package-core)

Returns an absolute file path or nil if none is found."
