not created a minibuffer frame on your own, a minibuffer frame is
created according to `minibuffer-frame-alist'.

You can specify geometry-related options for just the initial
frame by setting this variable in your init file; however, they
won't take effect until Emacs reads your init file, which happens
after creating the initial frame.  If you want the initial frame
to have the proper geometry as soon as it appears, you need to
use this three-step process:
* Specify X resources to give the geometry you want.
* Set `default-frame-alist' to override these options so that they
  don't affect subsequent frames.
* Set `initial-frame-alist' in a way that matches the X resources,
  to override what you put in `default-frame-alist'."

Exactly what is included in the return value depends on the
window-system and toolkit in use - see `frame-pixel-height' for
more details.  The lines are in units of the default font height.

The result is roughly related to the frame pixel height via
height in pixels = height in lines * `frame-char-height'.
However, this is only approximate, and is complicated e.g. by the
fact that individual window lines and menu bar lines can have
differing font heights."

DISPLAY can be a display name, a terminal name, or a frame.
If DISPLAY is omitted or nil, it defaults to the selected frame's display.
Each element of the list represents the attributes of a physical
monitor.  The first element corresponds to the primary monitor.

The attributes for a physical monitor are represented as an alist
of attribute keys and values as follows:

 geometry -- Position and size in pixels in the form of (X Y WIDTH HEIGHT)
 workarea -- Position and size of the work area in pixels in the
	     form of (X Y WIDTH HEIGHT)
 mm-size  -- Width and height in millimeters in the form of
 	     (WIDTH HEIGHT)
 frames   -- List of frames dominated by the physical monitor
 name (*) -- Name of the physical monitor as a string
 source (*) -- Source of multi-monitor information as a string

where X, Y, WIDTH, and HEIGHT are integers.  X and Y are coordinates
of the top-left corner, and might be negative for monitors other than
the primary one.  Keys labeled with (*) are optional.

The \"work area\" is a measure of the \"usable\" display space.
It may be less than the total screen size, owing to space taken up
by window manager features (docks, taskbars, etc.).  The precise
details depend on the platform and environment.

The `source' attribute describes the source from which the information
was obtained.  On X, this may be one of: \"Gdk\", \"XRandr\", \"Xinerama\",
or \"fallback\".

A frame is dominated by a physical monitor when either the
largest area of the frame resides in the monitor, or the monitor
is the closest to the frame if the frame does not intersect any
physical monitors.  Every (non-tooltip) frame (including invisible ones)
in a graphical display is dominated by exactly one physical
monitor at a time, though it can span multiple (or no) physical
monitors."
