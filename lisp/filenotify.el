This arranges for filesystem events pertaining to FILE to be reported
to Emacs.  Use `file-notify-rm-watch' to cancel the watch.

The returned value is a descriptor for the added watch.  If the
file cannot be watched for some reason, this function signals a
`file-notify-error' error.

FLAGS is a list of conditions to set what will be watched for.  It can
include the following symbols:

  `change'           -- watch for file changes
  `attribute-change' -- watch for file attributes changes, like
                        permissions or modification time

If FILE is a directory, `change' watches for file creation or
deletion in that directory.  Some of the file notification
backends report also file changes.  This does not work
recursively.

When any event happens, Emacs will call the CALLBACK function passing
it a single argument EVENT, which is of the form

  (DESCRIPTOR ACTION FILE [FILE1])

DESCRIPTOR is the same object as the one returned by this function.
ACTION is the description of the event.  It could be any one of the
following:

  `created'           -- FILE was created
  `deleted'           -- FILE was deleted
  `changed'           -- FILE has changed
  `renamed'           -- FILE has been renamed to FILE1
  `attribute-changed' -- a FILE attribute was changed
  `stopped'           -- watching FILE has been stopped
