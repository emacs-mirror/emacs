  "Add a watch for filesystem events pertaining to FILE.
This arranges for filesystem events pertaining to FILE to be reported
to Emacs.  Use `file-notify-rm-watch' to cancel the watch.

The returned value is a descriptor for the added watch.  If the
file cannot be watched for some reason, this function signals a
`file-notify-error' error.

FLAGS is a list of conditions to set what will be watched for.  It can
include the following symbols:

  `change'           -- watch for file changes
  `attribute-change' -- watch for file attributes changes, like
                        permissions or modification time

If FILE is a directory, `change' watches for file creation or
deletion in that directory.  This does not work recursively.

When any event happens, Emacs will call the CALLBACK function passing
it a single argument EVENT, which is of the form

  (DESCRIPTOR ACTION FILE [FILE1])

DESCRIPTOR is the same object as the one returned by this function.
ACTION is the description of the event.  It could be any one of the
following:

  `created'           -- FILE was created
  `deleted'           -- FILE was deleted
  `changed'           -- FILE has changed
  `renamed'           -- FILE has been renamed to FILE1
  `attribute-changed' -- a FILE attribute was changed
  `stopped'           -- watching FILE has been stopped

;;   If the file is created and *then* a watch is added to that file, the
