;;; Commentary:

;; "Electric" has been used in Emacs to refer to different things.
;; Among them:
;;
;; - electric modes and buffers: modes that typically pop-up in a modal kind of
;;   way a transient buffer that automatically disappears as soon as the user
;;   is done with it.
;;
;; - electric keys: self inserting keys which additionally perform some side
;;   operation which happens to be often convenient at that time.  Examples of
;;   such side operations are: reindenting code, inserting a newline,
;;   ... auto-fill-mode and abbrev-mode can be considered as built-in forms of
;;   electric key behavior.

;;; Code:

;; This loop is the guts for non-standard modes which retain control
;; until some event occurs.  It is a `do-forever', the only way out is
;; to throw.  It assumes that you have set up the keymap, window, and
;; everything else: all it does is read commands and execute them -
;; providing error messages should one occur (if there is no loop
;; function - which see).  The required argument is a tag which should
;; expect a value of nil if the user decides to punt. The second
;; argument is the prompt to be used: if nil, use "->", if 'noprompt,
;; don't use a prompt, if a string, use that string as prompt, and if
;; a function of no variable, it will be evaluated in every iteration
;; of the loop and its return value, which can be nil, 'noprompt or a
;; string, will be used as prompt.  Given third argument non-nil, it
;; INHIBITS quitting unless the user types C-g at toplevel.  This is
;; so user can do things like C-u C-g and not get thrown out.  Fourth
;; argument, if non-nil, should be a function of two arguments which
;; is called after every command is executed.  The fifth argument, if
;; provided, is the state variable for the function.  If the
;; loop-function gets an error, the loop will abort WITHOUT throwing
;; (moral: use unwind-protect around call to this function for any
;; critical stuff).  The second argument for the loop function is the
;; conditions for any error that occurred or nil if none.

With a prefix argument ARG, enable Electric Quote mode if
ARG is positive, and disable it otherwise.  If called from Lisp,
enable the mode if ARG is omitted or nil.

\\=`\\=` with “, and \\='\\=' with ”.  This occurs only in comments, strings,
