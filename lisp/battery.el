;;; Commentary:

;; There is at present support for GNU/Linux, macOS and Windows.  This
;; library supports both the `/proc/apm' file format of Linux version
;; 1.3.58 or newer and the `/proc/acpi/' directory structure of Linux
;; 2.4.20 and 2.6.  Darwin (macOS) is supported by using the `pmset'
;; program.  Windows is supported by the GetSystemPowerStatus API call.
