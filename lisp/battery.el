;;; Commentary:

;; There is at present support for GNU/Linux, BSD, macOS, and Windows.
;; This library supports:
;; - UPower (https://upower.freedesktop.org) via D-Bus API.
;; - The `/sys/class/power_supply/' files of Linux >= 2.6.39.
;; - The `/proc/acpi/' directory structure of Linux 2.4.20 and 2.6.
;; - The `/proc/apm' file format of Linux version 1.3.58 or newer.
;; - BSD by using the `apm' program.
;; - Darwin (macOS) by using the `pmset' program.
;; - Windows via the GetSystemPowerStatus API call.

When nil (the default), `battery-upower' queries all present
battery and line power devices as determined by the UPower
EnumerateDevices method.  A string or a nonempty list of strings
names particular devices to query instead.  UPower battery and
line power device names typically follow the patterns
\"battery_BATN\" and \"line_power_ACN\", respectively, with N
starting at 0 when present.  Device names should not include the
leading D-Bus path \"/org/freedesktop/UPower/devices/\"."
