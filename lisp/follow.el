;;; Commentary:

;; `Follow mode' is a minor mode for Emacs and XEmacs that
;; combines windows into one tall virtual window.
;;
;; The feeling of a "virtual window" has been accomplished by the use
;; of two major techniques:
;;
;; * The windows always display adjacent sections of the buffer.
;;   This means that whenever one window is moved, all the
;;   others will follow.  (Hence the name Follow mode.)
;;
;; * Should point (cursor) end up outside a window, another
;;   window displaying that point is selected, if possible.  This
;;   makes it possible to walk between windows using normal cursor
;;   movement commands.
;;
;; Follow mode comes to its prime when a large screen and two
;; side-by-side window are used.  The user can, with the help of Follow
;; mode, use two full-height windows as though they are one.
;; Imagine yourself editing a large function, or section of text,
;; and being able to use 144 lines instead of the normal 72... (your
;; mileage may vary).

;; To test this package, make sure `follow' is loaded, or will be
;; autoloaded when activated (see below).  Then do the following:
;;
;; * Find your favorite file (preferably a long one).
;;
;; * Resize Emacs so that it will be wide enough for two full size
;;   columns.  Delete the other windows and split the window with
;;   the commands `C-x 1 C-x 3'.
;;
;; * Give the command:
;;	M-x follow-mode <RETURN>
;;
;; * Now the display should look something like (assuming the text "71"
;;   is on line 71):
;;
;;		    +----------+----------+
;;		    |1         |73        |
;;		    |2         |74        |
;;		    |3         |75        |
;;		         ...        ...
;;		    |71        |143       |
;;		    |72        |144       |
;;		    +----------+----------+
;;
;;   As you can see, the right-hand window starts at line 73, the line
;;   immediately below the end of the left-hand window.  As long as
;;   `follow-mode' is active, the two windows will follow each other!
;;
;; * Play around and enjoy! Scroll one window and watch the other.
;;   Jump to the beginning or end.  Press `Cursor down' at the last
;;   line of the left-hand window.  Enter new lines into the
;;   text.  Enter long lines spanning several lines, or several
;;   windows.
;;
;; * Should you find `Follow' mode annoying, just type
;;	M-x follow-mode <RETURN>
;;   to turn it off.


;; The command `follow-delete-other-windows-and-split' maximizes the
;; visible area of the current buffer.
;;
;; I recommend adding it, and `follow-mode', to hotkeys in the global
;; key map.  To do so, add the following lines (replacing `[f7]' and
;; `[f8]' with your favorite keys) to the init file:
;;
;; (global-set-key [f8] 'follow-mode)
;; (global-set-key [f7] 'follow-delete-other-windows-and-split)


;; There exist two system variables that control the appearance of
;; lines wider than the window containing them.  The default is to
;; truncate long lines whenever a window isn't as wide as the frame.
;;
;; To make sure lines are never truncated, please place the following
;; lines in your init file:
;;
;; (setq truncate-lines nil)
;; (setq truncate-partial-width-windows nil)


;; The correct way to configure Follow mode, or any other mode for
;; that matter, is to create one or more functions that do
;; whatever you would like to do.  These functions are then added to
;; a hook.
;;
;; The keymap `follow-key-map' contains key bindings activated by
;; `follow-mode'.
;;
;; Example:
;; (add-hook 'follow-mode-hook 'my-follow-mode-hook)
;;
;; (defun my-follow-mode-hook ()
;;    (define-key follow-mode-map "\C-ca" 'your-favorite-function)
;;    (define-key follow-mode-map "\C-cb" 'another-function))


;; Usage:
;;
;; To activate, issue the command "M-x follow-mode"
;; and press Return.  To deactivate, do it again.
;;
;; The following is a list of commands useful when follow-mode is active.
;;
;;	follow-scroll-up			 C-c . C-v
;;		Scroll text in a Follow mode window chain up.
;;
;;	follow-scroll-down			 C-c . v
;;		Like `follow-scroll-up', but in the other direction.
;;
;;	follow-delete-other-windows-and-split	 C-c . 1
;;		Maximize the visible area of the current buffer,
;;		and enter Follow mode. 	This is a very convenient
;;		way to start Follow mode, hence we recommend that
;;		this command be added to the global keymap.
;;
;;	follow-recenter				 C-c . C-l
;;		Place point in the center of the middle window,
;;		or a specified number of lines from either top or bottom.
;;
;;	follow-switch-to-buffer			 C-c . b
;;		Switch buffer in all windows displaying the current buffer
;;		in this frame.
;;
;;	follow-switch-to-buffer-all		 C-c . C-b
;;		Switch buffer in all windows in the selected frame.
;;
;;	follow-switch-to-current-buffer-all
;;		Show the current buffer in all windows on the current
;;		frame and turn on `follow-mode'.
;;
;;	follow-first-window			 C-c . <
;;		Select the first window in the frame showing the same buffer.
;;
;;	follow-last-window			 C-c . >
;;		Select the last window in the frame showing the same buffer.
;;
;;	follow-next-window			 C-c . n
;;		Select the next window in the frame showing the same buffer.
;;
;;	follow-previous-window			 C-c . p
;;		Select the previous window showing the same buffer.


;; Well, it seems ok, but what if I really want to look at two different
;; positions in the text? Here are two simple methods to use:
;;
;; 1) Use multiple frames; `follow' mode only affects windows displayed
;;    in the same frame. (My apologies to you who can't use frames.)
;;
;; 2) Bind `follow-mode' to key so you can turn it off whenever
;;    you want to view two locations.  Of course, `follow' mode can
;;    be reactivated by hitting the same key again.
;;
;;    Example from my ~/.emacs:
;;	(global-set-key [f8] 'follow-mode)

;; Implementation:
;;
;; The main method by which Follow mode aligns windows is via the
;; function `follow-post-command-hook', which is run after each
;; command.  This "fixes up" the alignment of other windows which are
;; showing the same Follow mode buffer, on the same frame as the
;; selected window.  It does not try to deal with buffers other than
;; the buffer of the selected frame, or windows on other frames.
;;
;; Comint mode specially calls `follow-comint-scroll-to-bottom' on
;; Follow mode buffers.  This function scrolls the bottom-most window
;; in a window chain and aligns the other windows accordingly.  Follow
;; mode adds a function to `compilation-filter-hook' to align
;; compilation buffers.

Follow mode is a minor mode that combines windows into one tall
virtual window.  This is accomplished by two main techniques:

* The windows always displays adjacent sections of the buffer.
  This means that whenever one window is moved, all the
  others will follow.  (Hence the name Follow mode.)

* Should point (cursor) end up outside a window, another
  window displaying that point is selected, if possible.  This
  makes it possible to walk between windows using normal cursor
  movement commands.

Follow mode comes to its prime when used on a large screen and two or
more side-by-side windows are used.  The user can, with the help of
Follow mode, use these full-height windows as though they were one.
Imagine yourself editing a large function, or section of text, and
being able to use 144 or 216 lines instead of the normal 72... (your
mileage may vary).

To split one large window into two side-by-side windows, the commands
`\\[split-window-right]' or \
`\\[follow-delete-other-windows-and-split]' can be used.

Only windows displayed in the same frame follow each other.

This command runs the normal hook `follow-mode-hook'.
