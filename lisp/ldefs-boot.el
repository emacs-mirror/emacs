0 corresponds to `first', and numbers outside the valid range are

`activate': All advice of FUNCTION will be activated immediately if

`compile': In conjunction with `activate' specifies that the resulting
advised function should be compiled.

`disable': The defined advice will be disabled, hence, it will not be used
during activation until somebody enables it.

`preactivate': Preactivates the advised FUNCTION at macro-expansion/compile
time.  This generates a compiled advised definition according to the current
advice state that will be used during activation if appropriate.  Only use
this if the `defadvice' gets actually compiled.

;;; Generated autoloads from align.el

(autoload 'align "align" "\
Attempt to align a region based on a set of alignment rules.
Interactively, BEG and END are the mark/point of the current region.

Many modes define specific alignment rules, and some of these
rules in some modes react to the current prefix argument.  For
instance, in `text-mode', \\`M-x align' will align into columns
based on space delimiters, while \\`C-u -' \\`M-x align' will align
into columns based on the \"$\" character.  See the
`align-rules-list' variable definition for the specific rules.

Also see `align-regexp', which will guide you through various
parameters for aligning text.

Non-interactively, if BEG and END are nil, the beginning and end
of the current alignment section will be calculated based on the
location of point, and the value of `align-region-separate' (or
possibly each rule's `separate' attribute).

If SEPARATE is non-nil, it overrides the value of
`align-region-separate' for all rules, except those that have their
`separate' attribute set.

RULES and EXCLUDE-RULES, if either is non-nil, will replace the
default rule lists defined in `align-rules-list' and
`align-exclude-rules-list'.  See `align-rules-list' for more details
on the format of these lists.

(fn BEG END &optional SEPARATE RULES EXCLUDE-RULES)" t)
(autoload 'align-regexp "align" "\
Align the current region using an ad-hoc rule read from the minibuffer.
BEG and END mark the limits of the region.  Interactively, this function
prompts for the regular expression REGEXP to align with.

Interactively, if you specify a prefix argument, the function
will guide you through entering the full regular expression, and
then prompts for which subexpression parenthesis GROUP (default
1) within REGEXP to modify, the amount of SPACING (default
`align-default-spacing') to use, and whether or not to REPEAT the
rule throughout the line.

See `align-rules-list' for more information about these options.

For example, let's say you had a list of phone numbers, and wanted to
align them so that the opening parentheses would line up:

    Fred (123) 456-7890
    Alice (123) 456-7890
    Mary-Anne (123) 456-7890
    Joe (123) 456-7890

There is no predefined rule to handle this, but interactively,
all you would have to do is to mark the region, call `align-regexp'
and enter \"(\".

REGEXP must contain at least one parenthesized subexpression,
typically whitespace of the form \"\\\\(\\\\s-*\\\\)\", but in
interactive use, this is automatically added to the start of your
regular expression after you enter it.  Interactively, you only
need to supply the characters to be lined up, and any preceding
whitespace is replaced.

Non-interactively, you must enter the full regular expression,
including the subexpression.

The non-interactive form of the previous example would look something like:
  (align-regexp (point-min) (point-max) \"\\\\(\\\\s-*\\\\)(\")

construct a rule to pass to `align-region', which does the real work.

\\<allout-mode-map-value>
Allout outline mode is a minor mode that provides extensive
outline oriented formatting and manipulation.  It enables
structural editing of outlines, as well as navigation and
exposure.  It also is specifically aimed at accommodating
syntax-sensitive text like programming languages.  (For example,
see the allout code itself, which is organized as an allout
outline.)

In addition to typical outline navigation and exposure, allout includes:

 - topic-oriented authoring, including keystroke-based topic creation,
   repositioning, promotion/demotion, cut, and paste
 - incremental search with dynamic exposure and reconcealment of hidden text
 - adjustable format, so programming code can be developed in outline-structure
 - easy topic encryption and decryption, symmetric or key-pair
 - \"Hot-spot\" operation, for single-keystroke maneuvering and exposure control
 - integral outline layout, for automatic initial exposure when visiting a file
 - independent extensibility, using comprehensive exposure and authoring hooks

and many other features.

Below is a description of the key bindings, and then description
of special `allout-mode' features and terminology.  See also the
outline menubar additions for quick reference to many of the
features.  Customize `allout-auto-activation' to prepare your
Emacs session for automatic activation of `allout-mode'.

The bindings are those listed in `allout-prefixed-keybindings'
and `allout-unprefixed-keybindings'.  We recommend customizing
`allout-command-prefix' to use just `\\C-c' as the command
prefix, if the allout bindings don't conflict with any personal
bindings you have on \\C-c.  In any case, outline structure
navigation and authoring is simplified by positioning the cursor
on an item's bullet character, the \"hot-spot\" -- then you can
invoke allout commands with just the un-prefixed,
un-control-shifted command letters.  This is described further in
the HOT-SPOT Operation section.

        Exposure Control:
        ----------------
\\[allout-hide-current-subtree]   `allout-hide-current-subtree'
\\[allout-show-children] `allout-show-children'

\\[allout-end-of-entry] `allout-end-of-entry'
\\[allout-beginning-of-current-entry] `allout-beginning-of-current-entry' (alternately, goes to hot-spot)
\\[allout-beginning-of-line]  `allout-beginning-of-line' -- like regular beginning-of-line, but
     if immediately repeated cycles to the beginning of the current item
     and then to the hot-spot (if `allout-beginning-of-line-cycles' is set).


        Topic Header Production:

\\[allout-open-subtopic]   `allout-open-subtopic' ... an offspring of current topic.
\\[allout-open-supertopic] `allout-open-supertopic' ... a sibling of the current topic's parent.

        Topic Level and Prefix Adjustment:
        ---------------------------------
\\[allout-shift-in] `allout-shift-in'   Shift current topic and all offspring deeper
\\[allout-shift-out] `allout-shift-out' ... less deep
\\[allout-rebullet-current-heading] `allout-rebullet-current-heading' Prompt for alternate bullet for
            current topic
\\[allout-rebullet-topic] `allout-rebullet-topic'   Reconcile bullets of topic and
            its offspring -- distinctive bullets are not changed, others
            are alternated according to nesting depth.
\\[allout-number-siblings] `allout-number-siblings'  Number bullets of topic and siblings --
           the offspring are not affected.
           With repeat count, revoke numbering.

        Topic-oriented Killing and Yanking:

\\[allout-kill-topic] `allout-kill-topic'   Kill current topic, including offspring.
\\[allout-copy-topic-as-kill] `allout-copy-topic-as-kill' Copy current topic, including offspring.
\\[allout-kill-line]     `allout-kill-line'    Kill line, attending to outline structure.

                             heading (ie, prefix sans text).
\\[allout-yank-pop]     `allout-yank-pop'       Is to `allout-yank' as `yank-pop' is to `yank'.

                  Topic Encryption

Outline mode supports gpg encryption of topics, with support for
symmetric and key-pair modes, and auto-encryption of topics
pending encryption on save.

Topics pending encryption are, by default, automatically
encrypted during file saves, including checkpoint saves, to avoid
exposing the plain text of encrypted topics in the file system.
If the content of the topic containing the cursor was encrypted
for a save, it is automatically decrypted for continued editing.

NOTE: A few GnuPG v2 versions improperly preserve incorrect
symmetric decryption keys, preventing entry of the correct key on
subsequent decryption attempts until the cache times-out.  That
can take several minutes.  (Decryption of other entries is not
affected.)  Upgrade your EasyPG version, if you can, and you can
deliberately clear your gpg-agent's cache by sending it a `-HUP'
signal.

See `allout-toggle-current-subtree-encryption' function docstring
and `allout-encrypt-unencrypted-on-saves' customization variable
for details.

                 HOT-SPOT Operation

Hot-spot operation provides a means for easy, single-keystroke outline
navigation and exposure control.

When the text cursor is positioned directly on the bullet character of
a topic, regular characters (a to z) invoke the commands of the
corresponding allout-mode keymap control chars.  For example, \"f\"
would invoke the command typically bound to \"C-c<space>C-f\"
(\\[allout-forward-current-level] `allout-forward-current-level').

Thus, by positioning the cursor on a topic bullet, you can
execute the outline navigation and manipulation commands with a
single keystroke.  Regular navigation keys (eg, \\[forward-char], \\[next-line]) don't get
this special translation, so you can use them to get out of the
hot-spot and back to normal editing operation.

In allout-mode, the normal beginning-of-line command (\\[allout-beginning-of-line]) is
replaced with one that makes it easy to get to the hot-spot.  If you
repeat it immediately it cycles (if `allout-beginning-of-line-cycles'
is set) to the beginning of the item and then, if you hit it again
immediately, to the hot-spot.  Similarly, `allout-beginning-of-current-entry'
(\\[allout-beginning-of-current-entry]) moves to the hot-spot when the cursor is already located
at the beginning of the current entry.

                             Extending Allout

Allout exposure and authoring activities all have associated
hooks, by which independent code can cooperate with allout
without changes to the allout core.  Here are key ones:

`allout-mode-hook'
`allout-mode-off-hook'
`allout-exposure-change-functions'
`allout-structure-added-functions'
`allout-structure-deleted-functions'
`allout-structure-shifted-functions'
`allout-after-copy-or-kill-hook'
`allout-post-undo-hook'

                            Terminology

Topic hierarchy constituents -- TOPICS and SUBTOPICS:

ITEM:   A unitary outline element, including the HEADER and ENTRY text.
TOPIC:  An ITEM and any ITEMs contained within it, ie having greater DEPTH
        and with no intervening items of lower DEPTH than the container.
CURRENT ITEM:
        The visible ITEM most immediately containing the cursor.
DEPTH:  The degree of nesting of an ITEM; it increases with containment.
        The DEPTH is determined by the HEADER PREFIX.  The DEPTH is also
        called the:
LEVEL:  The same as DEPTH.

ANCESTORS:
        Those ITEMs whose TOPICs contain an ITEM.
PARENT: An ITEM's immediate ANCESTOR.  It has a DEPTH one less than that
        of the ITEM.
OFFSPRING:
        The ITEMs contained within an ITEM's TOPIC.
SUBTOPIC:
        An OFFSPRING of its ANCESTOR TOPICs.
CHILD:
        An immediate SUBTOPIC of its PARENT.
SIBLINGS:
        TOPICs having the same PARENT and DEPTH.

Topic text constituents:

HEADER: The first line of an ITEM, include the ITEM PREFIX and HEADER
        text.
ENTRY:  The text content of an ITEM, before any OFFSPRING, but including
        the HEADER text and distinct from the ITEM PREFIX.
BODY:   Same as ENTRY.
PREFIX: The leading text of an ITEM which distinguishes it from normal
        ENTRY text.  Allout recognizes the outline structure according
        to the strict PREFIX format.  It consists of a PREFIX-LEAD string,
        PREFIX-PADDING, and a BULLET.  The BULLET might be followed by a
        number, indicating the ordinal number of the topic among its
        siblings, or an asterisk indicating encryption, plus an optional
        space.  After that is the ITEM HEADER text, which is not part of
        the PREFIX.

        The relative length of the PREFIX determines the nesting DEPTH
        of the ITEM.
PREFIX-LEAD:
        The string at the beginning of a HEADER PREFIX, by default a `.'.
        It can be customized by changing the setting of
        `allout-header-prefix' and then reinitializing `allout-mode'.

        When the PREFIX-LEAD is set to the comment-string of a
        programming language, outline structuring can be embedded in
        program code without interfering with processing of the text
        (by Emacs or the language processor) as program code.  This
        setting happens automatically when allout mode is used in
        programming-mode buffers.  See `allout-use-mode-specific-leader'
        docstring for more detail.
PREFIX-PADDING:
        Spaces or asterisks which separate the PREFIX-LEAD and the
        bullet, determining the ITEM's DEPTH.
BULLET: A character at the end of the ITEM PREFIX, it must be one of
        the characters listed on `allout-plain-bullets-string' or
        `allout-distinctive-bullets-string'.  When creating a TOPIC,
        plain BULLETs are by default used, according to the DEPTH of the
        TOPIC.  Choice among the distinctive BULLETs is offered when you
        provide a universal argument (\\[universal-argument]) to the
        TOPIC creation command, or when explicitly rebulleting a TOPIC.  The
        significance of the various distinctive bullets is purely by
        convention.  See the documentation for the above bullet strings for
        more details.
EXPOSURE:
        The state of a TOPIC which determines the on-screen visibility
        of its OFFSPRING and contained ENTRY text.
CONCEALED:
        TOPICs and ENTRY text whose EXPOSURE is inhibited.  Concealed
        text is represented by \"...\" ellipses.

        CONCEALED TOPICs are effectively collapsed within an ANCESTOR.
CLOSED: A TOPIC whose immediate OFFSPRING and body-text is CONCEALED.
OPEN:	A TOPIC that is not CLOSED, though its OFFSPRING or BODY may be.

Major mode for editing arrays.

  Array mode is a specialized mode for editing arrays.  An array is
considered to be a two-dimensional set of strings.  The strings are
NOT recognized as integers or real numbers.

  The array MUST reside at the top of the buffer.

  TABs are not respected, and may be converted into spaces at any time.
Setting the variable `array-respect-tabs' to non-nil will prevent
TAB conversion, but will cause many functions to give errors if
they encounter one.

  Upon entering array mode, you will be prompted for the values of
several variables.  Others will be calculated based on the values you
supply.  These variables are all local to the buffer.  Other buffer
in array mode may have different values assigned to the variables.
The variables are:

Variables you assign:
     `array-max-row':          The number of rows in the array.
     `array-max-column':       The number of columns in the array.
     `array-columns-per-line': The number of columns in the array
                             per line of buffer.
     `array-field-width':      The width of each field, in characters.
     `array-rows-numbered':    A logical variable describing whether to ignore
                             row numbers in the buffer.

Variables which are calculated:
     `array-line-length':      The number of characters in a buffer line.
     `array-lines-per-row':    The number of buffer lines used to
                             display each row.

  The following commands are available (an asterisk indicates it may
take a numeric prefix argument):

    *  	\\<array-mode-map>\\[array-forward-column]	  Move forward one column.
    *  	\\[array-backward-column]	  Move backward one column.
    *  	\\[array-next-row]	  Move down one row.

    *   \\[array-copy-column-backward]   Copy current column into the column to the left.
    *   \\[array-copy-row-down]   Copy the current row into the row below.
    *   \\[array-copy-row-up]   Copy the current row into the row above.

        \\[array-fill-rectangle]   Copy field at mark into every cell with row and column

Drawing with the mouse:

 mouse-2
 shift mouse-2	Pops up a menu where you can select what to draw with
		mouse-1, and where you can do some settings (described
		below).

 mouse-1
 shift mouse-1	Draws lines, rectangles or poly-lines, erases, cuts, copies
		or pastes:

		* Straight lines can only go horizontally, vertically
		  or diagonally.

		* Poly-lines are drawn while holding mouse-1 down.  When you
		  release the button, the point is set.  If you want a segment
		  to be straight, hold down shift before pressing the
		  mouse-1 button.  Click mouse-2 or mouse-3 to stop drawing
		  poly-lines.

		* See thru for text means that text already in the buffer
		  will be visible through blanks in the text rendered, while
		  overwrite means the opposite.

		* Vaporizing connected lines only vaporizes lines whose
		  _endpoints_ are connected.  See also the variable
		  `artist-vaporize-fuzziness'.

		* Cut copies, then clears the rectangle/square.

		* When drawing lines or poly-lines, you can set arrows.
		  See below under \"Arrows\" for more info.

		* The mode line shows the currently selected drawing operation.
		  In addition, if it has an asterisk (*) at the end, you
		  are currently drawing something.

		* Be patient when flood-filling -- large areas take quite
		  some time to fill.


 mouse-3	Erases character under pointer
 shift mouse-3	Erases rectangle


Settings

 Set fill	Sets the character used when filling rectangles/squares

Hooks

 Turning the mode on or off runs `artist-mode-hook'.


Keymap summary

\\{artist-mode-map}

This is a minor mode.  If called interactively, toggle the `Artist mode'
mode.  If the prefix argument is positive, enable the mode, and if it is
zero or negative, disable the mode.

If called from Lisp, toggle the mode if ARG is `toggle'.  Enable the
mode if ARG is nil, omitted, or is a positive number.  Disable the mode
if ARG is a negative number.

To check whether the minor mode is enabled in the current buffer,
evaluate the variable `artist-mode'.

The mode's hook is called both when the mode is enabled and when it is
disabled.

Toggle reverting buffer when the file changes (Auto-Revert Mode).

Auto-Revert Mode is a minor mode that affects only the current
buffer.  When enabled, it reverts the buffer when the file on

When a buffer is reverted, a message is generated.  This can be
suppressed by setting `auto-revert-verbose' to nil.

Reverting can sometimes fail to preserve all the markers in the buffer.
To avoid that, set `revert-buffer-insert-file-contents-function' to
the slower function `revert-buffer-insert-file-contents-delicately'.

Use `global-auto-revert-mode' to automatically revert all buffers.
Use `auto-revert-tail-mode' if you know that the file will only grow
without being changed in the part that is already in the buffer.

some background process is appending to it from time to time),
this is reflected in the current buffer.

You can edit the buffer and turn this mode off and on again as
you please.  But make sure the background process has stopped
writing before you save the file!

works only with buffers containing valid (syntactically correct) and sorted
entries.  This is usually the case, if you have created a buffer completely
with BibTeX mode and finished every new entry with \\[bibtex-clean-entry].

For third party BibTeX files, call the command \\[bibtex-convert-alien]
to fully take advantage of all features of BibTeX mode.


Special information:

A command such as \\[bibtex-Book] outlines the fields for a BibTeX book entry.

The names of optional fields start with the string OPT, and are thus ignored
by BibTeX.  The names of alternative fields from which only one is required
start with the string ALT.  The OPT or ALT string may be removed from
the name of a field with \\[bibtex-remove-OPT-or-ALT].
\\[bibtex-make-field] inserts a new field after the current one.
\\[bibtex-kill-field] kills the current field entirely.
\\[bibtex-yank] yanks the last recently killed field after the current field.
\\[bibtex-remove-delimiters] removes the double-quotes or braces around the text of the current field.
\\[bibtex-empty-field] replaces the text of the current field with the default \"\" or {}.
\\[bibtex-find-text] moves point to the end of the current field.
\\[completion-at-point] completes word fragment before point according to context.

The command \\[bibtex-clean-entry] cleans the current entry, i.e. it removes OPT/ALT
from the names of all non-empty optional or alternative fields, checks that
no required fields are empty, and does some formatting dependent on the value
of `bibtex-entry-format'.  Furthermore, it can automatically generate a key
for the BibTeX entry, see `bibtex-generate-autokey'.
Note: some functions in BibTeX mode depend on entries being in a special
format (all fields beginning on separate lines), so it is usually a bad
idea to remove `realign' from `bibtex-entry-format'.

BibTeX mode supports Imenu and hideshow minor mode (`hs-minor-mode').

Play blackbox.
Optional prefix argument is the number of balls; the default is 4.

What is blackbox?

Blackbox is a game of hide and seek played on an 8 by 8 grid (the
Blackbox).  Your opponent (Emacs, in this case) has hidden several
balls (usually 4) within this box.  By shooting rays into the box and
observing where they emerge it is possible to deduce the positions of
the hidden balls.  The fewer rays you use to find the balls, the lower
your score.

Overview of play:

\\<blackbox-mode-map>To play blackbox, type \\[blackbox].  An optional prefix argument
specifies the number of balls to be hidden in the box; the default is
four.

The cursor can be moved around the box with the standard cursor
movement keys.

To shoot a ray, move the cursor to the edge of the box and press SPC.
The result will be determined and the playfield updated.

You may place or remove balls in the box by moving the cursor into the
box and pressing \\[bb-romp].

When you think the configuration of balls you have placed is correct,
press \\[bb-done].  You will be informed whether you are correct or
not, and be given your score.  Your score is the number of letters and
numbers around the outside of the box plus five for each incorrectly
placed ball.  If you placed any balls incorrectly, they will be
indicated with `x', and their actual positions indicated with `o'.

Details:

There are three possible outcomes for each ray you send into the box:

	Detour: the ray is deflected and emerges somewhere other than
		where you sent it in.  On the playfield, detours are
		denoted by matching pairs of numbers -- one where the
		ray went in, and the other where it came out.

	Reflection: the ray is reflected and emerges in the same place
		it was sent in.  On the playfield, reflections are
		denoted by the letter `R'.

	Hit:	the ray strikes a ball directly and is absorbed.  It does
		not emerge from the box.  On the playfield, hits are
		denoted by the letter `H'.

The rules for how balls deflect rays are simple and are best shown by
example.

As a ray approaches a ball it is deflected ninety degrees.  Rays can
be deflected multiple times.  In the diagrams below, the dashes
represent empty box locations and the letter `O' represents a ball.
The entrance and exit points of each ray are marked with numbers as
described under \"Detour\" above.  Note that the entrance and exit
points are always interchangeable.  `*' denotes the path taken by the
ray.

Note carefully the relative positions of the ball and the ninety
degree deflection it causes.

                                2                         3

As mentioned above, a reflection occurs when a ray emerges from the same point
it was sent in.  This can happen in several ways:


  - - - - - - - -         - - - - - - - -          - - - - - - - -
  - - - - O - - -         - - O - O - - -          - - - - - - - -
R * * * * - - - -         - - - * - - - -          O - - - - - - -
  - - - - O - - -         - - - * - - - -        R - - - - - - - -
  - - - - - - - -         - - - * - - - -          - - - - - - - -
  - - - - - - - -         - - - * - - - -          - - - - - - - -
  - - - - - - - -       R * * * * - - - -          - - - - - - - -
  - - - - - - - -         - - - - O - - -          - - - - - - - -

In the first example, the ray is deflected downwards by the upper
ball, then left by the lower ball, and finally retraces its path to
its point of origin.  The second example is similar.  The third
example is a bit anomalous but can be rationalized by realizing the
ray never gets a chance to get into the box.  Alternatively, the ray
can be thought of as being deflected downwards and immediately
emerging from the box.

A hit occurs when a ray runs straight into a ball:

  - - - - - - - -         - - - - - - - -          - - - - - - - -
  - - - - - - - -         - - - - - - - -          - - - - O - - -
  - - - - - - - -         - - - - O - - -        H * * * * - - - -
  - - - - - - - -       H * * * * O - - -          - - - * - - - -
  - - - - - - - -         - - - - O - - -          - - - O - - - -
H * * * O - - - -         - - - - - - - -          - - - - - - - -
  - - - - - - - -         - - - - - - - -          - - - - - - - -
  - - - - - - - -         - - - - - - - -          - - - - - - - -

Be sure to compare the second example of a hit with the first example of
a reflection.

(autoload 'common-lisp-indent-function "cl-indent" "\
Function to indent the arguments of a Lisp function call.
This is suitable for use as the value of the variable
`lisp-indent-function'.  INDENT-POINT is the point at which the
indentation function is called, and STATE is the
`parse-partial-sexp' state at that position.  Browse the
`lisp-indent' customize group for options affecting the behavior
of this function.

If the indentation point is in a call to a Lisp function, that
function's `common-lisp-indent-function' property specifies how
this function should indent it.  Possible values for this
property are:

* defun, meaning indent according to `lisp-indent-defun-method';
  i.e., like (4 &lambda &body), as explained below.

* any other symbol, meaning a function to call.  The function should
  take the arguments: PATH STATE INDENT-POINT SEXP-COLUMN NORMAL-INDENT.
  PATH is a list of integers describing the position of point in terms of
  list-structure with respect to the containing lists.  For example, in
  ((a b c (d foo) f) g), foo has a path of (0 3 1).  In other words,
  to reach foo take the 0th element of the outermost list, then
  the 3rd element of the next list, and finally the 1st element.
  STATE and INDENT-POINT are as in the arguments to
  `common-lisp-indent-function'.  SEXP-COLUMN is the column of
  the open parenthesis of the innermost containing list.
  NORMAL-INDENT is the column the indentation point was
  originally in.  This function should behave like `lisp-indent-259'.

* an integer N, meaning indent the first N arguments like
  function arguments, and any further arguments like a body.
  This is equivalent to (4 4 ... &body).

* a list.  The list element in position M specifies how to indent the Mth
  function argument.  If there are fewer elements than function arguments,
  the last list element applies to all remaining arguments.  The accepted
  list elements are:

  * nil, meaning the default indentation.

  * an integer, specifying an explicit indentation.

  * &lambda.  Indent the argument (which may be a list) by 4.

  * &rest.  When used, this must be the penultimate element.  The
    element after this one applies to all remaining arguments.

  * &body.  This is equivalent to &rest lisp-body-indent, i.e., indent
    all remaining elements by `lisp-body-indent'.

  * &whole.  This must be followed by nil, an integer, or a
    function symbol.  This indentation is applied to the
    associated argument, and as a base indent for all remaining
    arguments.  For example, an integer P means indent this
    argument by P, and all remaining arguments by P, plus the
    value specified by their associated list element.

  * a symbol.  A function to call, with the 6 arguments specified above.

  * a list, with elements as described above.  This applies when the
    associated function argument is itself a list.  Each element of the list
    specifies how to indent the associated argument.

For example, the function `case' has an indent property
(4 &rest (&whole 2 &rest 1)), meaning:
  * indent the first argument by 4.
  * arguments after the first should be lists, and there may be any number
    of them.  The first list element has an offset of 2, all the rest
    have an offset of 2+1=3.

If the current mode is actually `emacs-lisp-mode', look for a
`common-lisp-indent-function-for-elisp' property before looking
at `common-lisp-indent-function' and, if set, use its value
instead.

Extended form of traditional Lisp `cond' construct.
A `cond*' construct is a series of clauses, and a clause
normally has the form (CONDITION BODY...).

CONDITION can be a Lisp expression, as in `cond'.
Or it can be one of `(bind* BINDINGS...)', `(match* PATTERN DATUM)',
or `(pcase* PATTERN DATUM)',

`(bind* BINDINGS...)' means to bind BINDINGS (as if they were in `let*')
for the body of the clause, and all subsequent clauses, since the `bind*'
clause is always a non-exit clause.  As a condition, it counts as true
and runs the body of the clause if the first binding's value is non-nil.

`(match* PATTERN DATUM)' means to match DATUM against the pattern PATTERN
For its patterns, see `match*'.
The condition counts as true if PATTERN matches DATUM.

`(bind-and* BINDINGS...)' means to bind BINDINGS (as if they were in
`if-let*') for only the the body of the clause.  If any expression
evaluates to nil, the condition counts as false.

`(pcase* PATTERN DATUM)' means to match DATUM against the
pattern PATTERN, using the same pattern syntax as `pcase'.
The condition counts as true if PATTERN matches DATUM.

When a clause's condition is true, and it exits the `cond*'
or is the last clause, the value of the last expression
in its body becomes the return value of the `cond*' construct.

Non-exit clause:

If a clause has only one element, or if its first element is
t or a `bind*' clause, this clause never exits the `cond*' construct.
Instead, control always falls through to the next clause (if any).
All bindings made in CONDITION for the BODY of the non-exit clause
are passed along to the rest of the clauses in this `cond*' construct.

\\[match*] for documentation of the patterns for use in `match*'.

(fn &rest CLAUSES)" nil t)
(autoload 'match* "cond-star" "\
This specifies matching DATUM against PATTERN.
This is not really a Lisp operator; it is meaningful only in the
CONDITION of a `cond*' clause.

`_' matches any value.
KEYWORD matches that keyword.
nil  matches nil.
t    matches t.
SYMBOL matches any value and binds SYMBOL to that value.
  If SYMBOL has been matched and bound earlier in this pattern,
  it matches here the same value that it matched before.
REGEXP matches a string if REGEXP matches it.
  The match must cover the entire string from its first char to its last.
ATOM (meaning any other kind of non-list not described above)
  matches anything `equal' to it.
(rx REGEXP) uses a regexp specified in s-expression form,
  as in the function `rx', and matches the data that way.
(rx REGEXP SYM0 SYM1...) uses a regexp specified in s-expression form,
  and binds the symbols SYM0, SYM1, and so on
  to (match-string 0 DATUM), (match-string 1 DATUM), and so on.
  You can use as many SYMs as regexp matching supports.

\\=`OBJECT  matches any value `equal' to OBJECT.
(cons CARPAT CDRPAT)
  matches a cons cell if CARPAT matches its car and CDRPAT matches its cdr.
(list ELTPATS...)
  matches a list if the ELTPATS match its elements.
  The first ELTPAT should match the list's first element.
  The second ELTPAT should match the list's second element.  And so on.
(vector ELTPATS...)
  matches a vector if the ELTPATS match its elements.
  The first ELTPAT should match the vector's first element.
  The second ELTPAT should match the vector's second element.  And so on.
(cdr PATTERN)  matches PATTERN with strict checking of cdrs.
  That means that `list' patterns verify that the final cdr is nil.
  Strict checking is the default.
(cdr-ignore PATTERN)  matches PATTERN with lax checking of cdrs.
  That means that `list' patterns do not examine the final cdr.
(and CONJUNCTS...)  matches each of the CONJUNCTS against the same data.
  If all of them match, this pattern succeeds.
  If one CONJUNCT fails, this pattern fails and does not try more CONJUNCTS.
(or DISJUNCTS...)  matches each of the DISJUNCTS against the same data.
  If one DISJUNCT succeeds, this pattern succeeds
  and does not try more DISJUNCTs.
  If all of them fail, this pattern fails.
(COND*-EXPANDER ...)
  Here the car is a symbol that has a `cond*-expander' property
  which defines how to handle it in a pattern.  The property value
  is a function.  Trying to match such a pattern calls that
  function with one argument, the pattern in question (including its car).
  The function should return an equivalent pattern
  to be matched instead.
(PREDICATE SYMBOL)
  matches datum if (PREDICATE DATUM) is true,
  then binds SYMBOL to DATUM.
(PREDICATE SYMBOL MORE-ARGS...)
  matches datum if (PREDICATE DATUM MORE-ARGS...) is true,
  then binds SYMBOL to DATUM.
  MORE-ARGS... can refer to symbols bound earlier in the pattern.
(constrain SYMBOL EXP)
  matches datum if the form EXP is true.
  EXP can refer to symbols bound earlier in the pattern.

Mode for Unix and Windows Conf files and Java properties.
Most conf files know only three kinds of constructs: parameter
assignments optionally grouped into sections and comments.  Yet
there is a great range of variation in the exact syntax of conf
files.  See below for various wrapper commands that set up the
details for some of the most widespread variants.

This mode sets up font locking, outline, imenu and it provides
alignment support through `conf-align-assignments'.  If strings
come out wrong, try `conf-quote-normal'.

Some files allow continuation lines, either with a backslash at
the end of line, or by indenting the next line (further).  These
constructs cannot currently be recognized.

Because of this great variety of nuances, which are often not
even clearly specified, please don't expect it to get every file
quite right.  Patches that clearly identify some special case,
without breaking the general ones, are welcome.

If instead you start this mode with the generic `conf-mode'
command, it will parse the buffer.  It will generally well
identify the first four cases listed below.  If the buffer
doesn't have enough contents to decide, this is identical to
`conf-windows-mode' on Windows, elsewhere to `conf-unix-mode'.

Major mode for editing Perl code.
Expression and list commands understand all C brackets.
Tab indents for Perl code.
Paragraphs are separated by blank lines only.
Delete converts tabs to spaces as it moves back.

Various characters in Perl almost always come in pairs: {}, (), [],
sometimes <>.  When the user types the first, she gets the second as
well, with optional special formatting done on {}.  (Disabled by
default.)  You can always quote (with \\[quoted-insert]) the left
\"paren\" to avoid the expansion.  The processing of < is special,
since most the time you mean \"less\".  CPerl mode tries to guess
whether you want to type pair <>, and inserts is if it
appropriate.  You can set `cperl-electric-parens-string' to the string that
contains the parens from the above list you want to be electrical.
Electricity of parens is controlled by `cperl-electric-parens'.
You may also set `cperl-electric-parens-mark' to have electric parens
look for active mark and \"embrace\" a region if possible.'

CPerl mode provides expansion of the Perl control constructs:

   if, else, elsif, unless, while, until, continue, do,
   for, foreach, formy and foreachmy.

and POD directives (Disabled by default, see `cperl-electric-keywords'.)

The user types the keyword immediately followed by a space, which
causes the construct to be expanded, and the point is positioned where
she is most likely to want to be.  E.g., when the user types a space
following \"if\" the following appears in the buffer: if () { or if ()
} { } and the cursor is between the parentheses.  The user can then
type some boolean expression within the parens.  Having done that,
typing \\[cperl-linefeed] places you - appropriately indented - on a
new line between the braces (if you typed \\[cperl-linefeed] in a POD
directive line, then appropriate number of new lines is inserted).

If CPerl decides that you want to insert \"English\" style construct like

            bite if angry;

it will not do any expansion.  See also help on variable
`cperl-extra-newline-before-brace'.  (Note that one can switch the
help message on expansion by setting `cperl-message-electric-keyword'
to nil.)

\\[cperl-linefeed] is a convenience replacement for typing carriage
return.  It places you in the next line with proper indentation, or if
you type it inside the inline block of control construct, like

            foreach (@lines) {print; print}

and you are on a boundary of a statement inside braces, it will
transform the construct into a multiline and will place you into an
appropriately indented blank line.  If you need a usual
`newline-and-indent' behavior, it is on \\[newline-and-indent],
see documentation on `cperl-electric-linefeed'.

Use \\[cperl-invert-if-unless] to change a construction of the form

`cperl-electric-parens-mark' and `cperl-electric-parens'), setting
`cperl-electric-keywords' enables electric expansion of control
structures in CPerl.  `cperl-electric-linefeed' governs which one of two
linefeed behavior is preferable.  You can enable all these options
simultaneously by setting `cperl-hairy' to t.  In this case you can
switch separate options off by setting them to `null'.  Note that one may
undo the extra whitespace inserted by semis and braces in
`auto-newline'-mode by consequent \\[cperl-electric-backspace].

Short one-liner-style help is available on \\[cperl-get-help],
and one can run perldoc or man via menu.

It is possible to show this help automatically after some idle time.
This is regulated by variable `cperl-lazy-help-time'.  Default with
`cperl-hairy' (if the value of `cperl-lazy-help-time' is nil) is 5
secs idle time .  It is also possible to switch this on/off from the
menu, or via \\[cperl-toggle-autohelp].

Use \\[cperl-lineup] to vertically lineup some construction - put the
beginning of the region at the start of construction, and make region
span the needed amount of lines.

Variables `cperl-pod-here-scan', `cperl-pod-here-fontify',
`cperl-pod-face', `cperl-pod-head-face' control processing of POD and
here-docs sections.  Results of scan are used for indentation too.

Variables controlling indentation style:
 `cperl-tab-always-indent'
    Non-nil means TAB in CPerl mode should always reindent the current line,
    regardless of where in the line point is when the TAB command is used.
 `cperl-indent-left-aligned-comments'
    Non-nil means that the comment starting in leftmost column should indent.
 `cperl-auto-newline'
    Non-nil means automatically newline before and after braces,
    and after colons and semicolons, inserted in Perl code.  The following
    \\[cperl-electric-backspace] will remove the inserted whitespace.
    Insertion after colons requires both this variable and
    `cperl-auto-newline-after-colon' set.
 `cperl-auto-newline-after-colon'
    Non-nil means automatically newline even after colons.
    Subject to `cperl-auto-newline' setting.
 `cperl-indent-level'
    Indentation of Perl statements within surrounding block.
    The surrounding block's indentation is the indentation
    of the line on which the open-brace appears.
 `cperl-continued-statement-offset'
    Extra indentation given to a substatement, such as the
    then-clause of an if, or body of a while, or just a statement continuation.
 `cperl-continued-brace-offset'
    Extra indentation given to a brace that starts a substatement.
    This is in addition to `cperl-continued-statement-offset'.
 `cperl-brace-offset'
    Extra indentation for line if it starts with an open brace.
 `cperl-brace-imaginary-offset'
    An open brace following other text is treated as if it the line started
    this far to the right of the actual line indentation.
 `cperl-label-offset'
    Extra indentation for line that is a label.
 `cperl-min-label-indent'
    Minimal indentation for line that is a label.

Settings for classic indent-styles: K&R BSD=C++ GNU PBP PerlStyle=Whitesmith
  `cperl-indent-level'                5   4       2   4   4
  `cperl-brace-offset'                0   0       0   0   0
  `cperl-continued-brace-offset'     -5  -4       0   0   0
  `cperl-label-offset'               -5  -4      -2  -2  -4
  `cperl-continued-statement-offset'  5   4       2   4   4

CPerl knows several indentation styles, and may bulk set the
corresponding variables.  Use \\[cperl-set-style] to do this or
set the variable `cperl-file-style' user option.  Use
\\[cperl-set-style-back] to restore the memorized preexisting
values (both available from menu).  See examples in
`cperl-style-examples'.

Part of the indentation style is how different parts of if/elsif/else
statements are broken into lines; in CPerl, this is reflected on how
templates for these constructs are created (controlled by
`cperl-extra-newline-before-brace'), and how reflow-logic should treat
\"continuation\" blocks of else/elsif/continue, controlled by the same
variable, and by `cperl-extra-newline-before-brace-multiline',
`cperl-merge-trailing-else', `cperl-indent-region-fix-constructs'.

If `cperl-indent-level' is 0, the statement after opening brace in
column 0 is indented on
`cperl-brace-offset'+`cperl-continued-statement-offset'.

Turning on CPerl mode calls the hooks in the variable `cperl-mode-hook'
with no args.

DO NOT FORGET to read micro-docs (available from `Perl' menu)
or as help on variables `cperl-tips', `cperl-problems',
`cperl-praise', `cperl-speed'." t)

Major mode for editing DCL-files.

This mode indents command lines in blocks.  (A block is commands between

dcl-block-end-regexp.)

Labels are indented to a fixed position unless they begin or end a block.
Whole-line comments (matching dcl-comment-line-regexp) are not indented.
Data lines are not indented.

Key bindings:

\\{dcl-mode-map}
Commands not usually bound to keys:

\\[dcl-save-nondefault-options]		Save changed options
\\[dcl-save-all-options]		Save all options
\\[dcl-save-option]			Save any option
\\[dcl-save-mode]			Save buffer mode

Variables controlling indentation style and extra features:

 dcl-basic-offset
    Extra indentation within blocks.

 dcl-continuation-offset
    Extra indentation for continued lines.

 dcl-margin-offset
    Indentation for the first command line in a file or SUBROUTINE.

 dcl-margin-label-offset
    Indentation for a label.

 dcl-comment-line-regexp
    Lines matching this regexp will not be indented.

 dcl-block-begin-regexp
 dcl-block-end-regexp
    Regexps that match command lines that begin and end, respectively,
    a block of command lines that will be given extra indentation.
    Command lines between THEN-ELSE-ENDIF are always indented; these variables
    make it possible to define other places to indent.
    Set to nil to disable this feature.

 dcl-calc-command-indent-function

    Two such functions are included in the package:
	dcl-calc-command-indent-multiple
	dcl-calc-command-indent-hang

 dcl-calc-cont-indent-function
    Can be set to a function that customizes indentation for continued lines.
    One such function is included in the package:
	dcl-calc-cont-indent-relative    (set by default)

 dcl-tab-always-indent
    If t, pressing TAB always indents the current line.
    If nil, pressing TAB indents the current line if point is at the left
    margin.

 dcl-electric-characters
    Non-nil causes lines to be indented at once when a label, ELSE or ENDIF is
    typed.

 dcl-electric-reindent-regexps
    Use this variable and function dcl-electric-character to customize
    which words trigger electric indentation.

 dcl-tempo-comma
 dcl-tempo-left-paren
 dcl-tempo-right-paren
    These variables control the look of expanded templates.

 dcl-imenu-generic-expression
    Default value for `imenu-generic-expression'.  The default includes
    SUBROUTINE labels in the main listing and sub-listings for
    other labels, CALL, GOTO and GOSUB statements.

 dcl-imenu-label-labels
 dcl-imenu-label-goto
 dcl-imenu-label-gosub
 dcl-imenu-label-call
    Change the text that is used as sub-listing labels in imenu.

Turning on DCL mode calls the value of the variable `dcl-mode-hook'
with no args, if that value is non-nil.


The following example uses the default values for all variables:

when `noninteractive' is non-nil), it shows the Lisp backtrace on the

and then kills Emacs, causing it to exit with a negative exit code.

You may call with no args, or you may pass nil as the first arg and
any other args you like.  In that case, the list of args after the
first will be printed into the backtrace buffer.

                   A nil value means to simply use the same abbrev-table
                   as the parent.
           :after-hook FORM
                   A single Lisp form which is evaluated after the mode
                   hooks have been run.  It should not be quoted.
           :interactive BOOLEAN
                   Whether the derived mode should be `interactive' or not.
                   The default is t.

BODY:      forms to execute just before running the
           hooks for the new mode.  Do not use `interactive' here.

Here is how you could define LaTeX-Thesis mode as a variant of LaTeX mode:

  (define-derived-mode LaTeX-thesis-mode LaTeX-mode \"LaTeX-Thesis\")

You could then make new key bindings for `LaTeX-thesis-mode-map'
without changing regular LaTeX mode.  In this example, BODY is empty,
and DOCSTRING is generated by default.

As a more complex example, the following command uses `sgml-mode' as
the parent, and then sets the variable `case-fold-search' to nil:

  (define-derived-mode article-mode sgml-mode \"Article\"
    \"Major mode for editing technical articles.\"
    (setq case-fold-search nil))

Note that if the documentation string had been left out, it would have
been generated automatically, with a reference to the keymap.

The new mode runs the hook named MODE-hook.  For `foo-mode',

When Desktop Save mode is enabled, the state of Emacs is saved from one

configuration, and some important global variables.

To enable this feature for future sessions, customize `desktop-save-mode'

When this mode is enabled, Emacs will save the desktop when it exits
(this may prompt you, see the option `desktop-save').  The next time
Emacs starts, if this mode is active it will restore the desktop.

To manually save the desktop at any time, use the command \\[desktop-save].
To load it, use \\[desktop-read].

Once a desktop file exists, Emacs will auto-save it according to the
option `desktop-auto-save-timeout'.

To see all the options you can set, browse the `desktop' customization group.

For further details, see info node `(emacs)Saving Emacs Sessions'.

`Desktop-Save mode' mode.  If the prefix argument is positive, enable

mode if ARG is nil, omitted, or is a positive number.  Disable the mode
if ARG is a negative number.

REPL is the replacement character to use.  If it's omitted, it defaults

black diamond with a question mark inside.

  to `defcustom' if the minor mode is global):

:global GLOBAL	If non-nil specifies that the minor mode is not meant to be
		buffer-local, so don't make the variable MODE buffer-local.
		By default, the mode is buffer-local.
:init-value VAL	the initial value of the mode's variable.
		Note that the minor mode function won't be called by setting
		this option, so the value *reflects* the minor mode's natural
		initial state, rather than *setting* it.
		In the vast majority of cases it should be nil.
		Not used if you also specify :variable.
:lighter SPEC	Text displayed in the mode line when the mode is on.
:keymap MAP	Keymap bound to the mode keymap.  Defaults to `MODE-map'.
                If non-nil, it should be an unquoted variable name (whose value
                is a keymap), or an expression that returns either a keymap or
		a list of (KEY . BINDING) pairs where KEY and BINDING are
		suitable for `define-key'.  If you supply a KEYMAP argument
		that is not a symbol, this macro defines the variable MODE-map
		and gives it the value that KEYMAP specifies.
:interactive VAL  Whether this mode should be a command or not.  The default
                is to make it one; use nil to avoid that.  If VAL is a list,
                it's interpreted as a list of major modes this minor mode
                is useful in.
:variable PLACE	The location to use instead of the variable MODE to store
		the state of the mode.	This can be simply a different
		named variable, or a generalized variable.
		PLACE can also be of the form (GET . SET), where GET is
		an expression that returns the current state, and SET is
		a function that takes one argument, the new state, which should
                be assigned to PLACE.  If you specify a :variable, this function
                does not define a MODE variable (nor any of the terms used
		in :variable).
:after-hook     A single Lisp form which is evaluated after the mode hooks
                have been run.  It should not be quoted.

For example, you could write
  (define-minor-mode foo-mode \"If enabled, foo on you!\"
    :lighter \" Foo\" :require \\='foo :global t :group \\='hassle :version \"27.5\"
    ...BODY CODE...)

For backward compatibility with the Emacs<21 calling convention,
the keywords can also be preceded by the obsolete triplet
INIT-VALUE LIGHTER KEYMAP.

Make a global mode GLOBAL-MODE corresponding to buffer-local minor MODE.
TURN-ON is a function that will be called with no args in every buffer
and that should try to turn MODE on if applicable for that buffer.

Each of KEY VALUE is a pair of CL-style keyword arguments.
The :predicate key specifies in which major modes should the
globalized minor mode be switched on.  The value should be t (meaning
switch on the minor mode in all major modes), nil (meaning don't
switch on in any major mode), a list of modes (meaning switch on only
in those modes and their descendants), or a list (not MODES...),
meaning switch on in any major mode except MODES.  The value can also
mix all of these forms, see the Info node `(elisp)Defining Minor Modes'
for details.  The :predicate key causes the macro to create a user option
named the same as MODE, but ending with \"-modes\" instead of \"-mode\".
That user option can then be used to customize in which modes this
globalized minor mode will be switched on.
As the minor mode defined by this function is always global, any
:global keyword is ignored.
Other keywords have the same meaning as in `define-minor-mode',
which see.  In particular, :group specifies the custom group.
The most useful keywords are those that are passed on to the `defcustom'.
It normally makes no sense to pass the :lighter or :keymap keywords
to `define-globalized-minor-mode', since these are usually passed to
the buffer-local version of the minor mode.

BODY contains code to execute each time the mode is enabled or disabled.
It is executed after toggling the mode, and before running
GLOBAL-MODE-hook.

If MODE's set-up depends on the major mode in effect when it was
enabled, then disabling and reenabling MODE should make MODE work
correctly with the current major mode.  This is important to
prevent problems with derived modes, that is, major modes that
call another major mode in their body.

When a major mode is initialized, MODE is actually turned on just
after running the major mode's hook.  However, MODE is not turned
on if the hook has explicitly disabled it.

This starts a Language Server Protocol (LSP) server suitable for

Interactively, the command attempts to guess MANAGED-MAJOR-MODES,
CLASS, CONTACT, and LANGUAGE-IDS from `eglot-server-programs',
according to the current buffer's `major-mode'.  PROJECT is
guessed from `project-find-functions'.  The search for active
projects in this context binds `eglot-lsp-context' (which see).

If it can't guess, it prompts the user for the mode and the
server.  With a single \\[universal-argument] prefix arg, it
always prompts for COMMAND.  With two \\[universal-argument], it
also always prompts for MANAGED-MAJOR-MODE.

The LSP server of CLASS is started (or contacted) via CONTACT.

buffers of MANAGED-MAJOR-MODE inside PROJECT become \"managed\"
by the LSP server, meaning the information about their contents is
exchanged periodically with the server to provide enhanced

Define NAME as a new class derived from SUPERCLASS with SLOTS.
OPTIONS-AND-DOC is used as the class' options and base documentation.
SUPERCLASSES is a list of superclasses to inherit from, with SLOTS
being the slots residing in that class definition.  Supported tags are:

  :initform   - Initializing form.
  :initarg    - Tag used during initialization.
  :accessor   - Tag used to create a function to access this slot.
  :allocation - Specify where the value is stored.
                Defaults to `:instance', but could also be `:class'.
  :writer     - A function symbol which will `write' an object's slot.
  :reader     - A function symbol which will `read' an object.
  :type       - The type of data allowed in this slot (see `typep').
  :documentation
              - A string documenting use of this slot.

The following are extensions on CLOS:
  :custom     - When customizing an object, the custom :type.  Public only.
  :label      - A text string label used for a slot when customizing.
  :group      - Name of a customization group this slot belongs in.
  :printer    - A function to call to print the value of a slot.
                See `eieio-override-prin1' as an example.

A class can also have optional options.  These options happen in place
of documentation (including a :documentation tag), in addition to
documentation, or not at all.  Supported options are:

  :documentation - The doc-string used for this class.

Options added to EIEIO:

  :allow-nil-initform - Non-nil to skip typechecking of null initforms.
  :custom-groups      - List of custom group names.  Organizes slots into
                        reasonable groups for customizations.
  :abstract           - Non-nil to prevent instances of this class.
                        If a string, use as an error string if someone does
                        try to make an instance.
  :method-invocation-order

  :default-initargs - Initargs to use when initializing new objects of
                      this class.

Due to the way class options are set up, you can add any tags you wish,
and reference them using the function `class-option'.

identifies (co-)occurrences of SYM in the current defun; and DEF is the

bound, then DEF is nil.

If STREAM is nil, it defaults to the current buffer.  When reading from
the current buffer, this function leaves point at the end of the form.

This function recursively analyzes Lisp forms (HEAD . TAIL), usually
starting with a top-level form, by inspecting HEAD at each level:

- If HEAD is a symbol with a non-nil `elisp-scope-analyzer' symbol
  property, then the value of that property specifies a bespoke analyzer
  function, AF, that is called as (AF HEAD . TAIL) to analyze the form.
  See more details about writing analyzer functions below.

- If HEAD satisfies `functionp', which means it is a function in the
  running Emacs session, analyze the form as a function call.

- If HEAD is a safe macro (see `elisp-scope-safe-macro-p'), expand it
  and analyze the resulting form.

- If HEAD is unknown, then the arguments in TAIL are ignored, unless
  `elisp-scope-assume-func' is non-nil, in which case they are analyzed
  as evaluated forms (i.e. HEAD is assumed to be a function).

An analyzer (function specified via the `elisp-scope-analyzer' property)
can use the functions `elisp-scope-report-s', `elisp-scope-1' and
`elisp-scope-n' to analyze its arguments, and it can consult the
variable `elisp-scope-output-spec' to obtain the expected output spec of
the analyzed form.  For example, the following is a suitable analyzer
for the `identity' function:

Together with `erc-tls', this command serves as the main entry

  :server    `erc-compute-server'

  :user      `erc-compute-user'

  :id'        N/A

For example, when called in the following manner

   (erc :server \"irc.libera.chat\" :full-name \"J. Random Hacker\")

ERC assigns SERVER and FULL-NAME the associated keyword values
and defers to `erc-compute-port', `erc-compute-user', and

   \\`0'      Reset the font size to the global default

Each step scales the height of the default face by the factor that

font size to the original value.

This command is a special-purpose wrapper around the
`text-scale-increase' command which makes repetition convenient
even when it is bound in a non-top-level keymap.  For binding in
a top-level keymap, `text-scale-increase' or
`text-scale-decrease' may be more appropriate.

Most faces are affected by these font size changes, but not faces
that have an explicit `:height' setting.  The two exceptions to
this are the `default' and `header-line' faces: they will both be
scaled even if they have an explicit `:height' setting.

See also the related command `global-text-scale-adjust'.  Unlike
that command, which scales the font size with a increment (and can
also optionally resize frames to keep the same number of lines and
characters per line), `text-scale-adjust' scales the font size with
a factor, `text-scale-mode-step'.  With a small `text-scale-mode-step'

Flymake is an Emacs minor mode for on-the-fly syntax checking.
Flymake collects diagnostic information from multiple sources,
called backends, and visually annotates the buffer with the
results.

Flymake performs these checks while the user is editing.
The customization variables `flymake-start-on-flymake-mode',
`flymake-no-changes-timeout' determine the exact circumstances
whereupon Flymake decides to initiate a check of the buffer.

The commands `flymake-goto-next-error' and
`flymake-goto-prev-error' can be used to navigate among Flymake
diagnostics annotated in the buffer.

By default, `flymake-mode' doesn't override the \\[next-error] command, but
if you're using Flymake a lot (and don't use the regular compilation
mechanisms that often), it can be useful to put something like
the following in your init file:

  (setq next-error-function \\='flymake-goto-next-error)

The visual appearance of each type of diagnostic can be changed
by setting properties `flymake-overlay-control', `flymake-bitmap'
and `flymake-severity' on the symbols of diagnostic types (like
`:error', `:warning' and `:note').

Activation or deactivation of backends used by Flymake in each
buffer happens via the special hook
`flymake-diagnostic-functions'.

Some backends may take longer than others to respond or complete,
and some may decide to disable themselves if they are not
suitable for the current buffer.  The commands
`flymake-running-backends', `flymake-disabled-backends' and
`flymake-reporting-backends' summarize the situation, as does the
special *Flymake log* buffer.

Flyspell mode is a buffer-local minor mode.  When enabled, it
spawns a single Ispell process and checks each word.  The default
flyspell behavior is to highlight incorrect words.

This mode is geared toward text modes.  In buffers that contain
code, `flyspell-prog-mode' is usually a better choice.

Bindings:
\\[ispell-word]: correct words (using Ispell).
\\[flyspell-auto-correct-word]: automatically correct word.
\\[flyspell-auto-correct-previous-word]: automatically correct the last misspelled word.
\\[flyspell-correct-word] (or down-mouse-2): popup correct words.

Hooks:
This runs `flyspell-mode-hook' after flyspell mode is entered or exit.

Remark:
`flyspell-mode' uses `ispell-mode'.  Thus all Ispell options are
valid.  For instance, a different dictionary can be used by
invoking `ispell-change-dictionary'.

Consider using the `ispell-parser' to check your text.  For instance
consider adding:
(add-hook \\='tex-mode-hook (lambda () (setq ispell-parser \\='tex)))
in your init file.

\\[flyspell-region] checks all words inside a region.
\\[flyspell-buffer] checks the whole buffer.

Toggle Follow mode.

Follow mode is a minor mode that combines windows into one tall
virtual window.  This is accomplished by two main techniques:

* The windows always displays adjacent sections of the buffer.
  This means that whenever one window is moved, all the
  others will follow.  (Hence the name Follow mode.)

* Should point (cursor) end up outside a window, another
  window displaying that point is selected, if possible.  This
  makes it possible to walk between windows using normal cursor
  movement commands.

Follow mode comes to its prime when used on a large screen and two or
more side-by-side windows are used.  The user can, with the help of
Follow mode, use these full-height windows as though they were one.
Imagine yourself editing a large function, or section of text, and
being able to use 144 or 216 lines instead of the normal 72... (your
mileage may vary).

To split one large window into two side-by-side windows, the commands
\\[split-window-right] or \\[follow-delete-other-windows-and-split] can be used.

Only windows displayed in the same frame follow each other.

This command runs the normal hook `follow-mode-hook'.

Keys specific to Follow mode:
\\{follow-mode-map}

This is a minor mode.  If called interactively, toggle the `Follow mode'
mode.  If the prefix argument is positive, enable the mode, and if it is
zero or negative, disable the mode.

If called from Lisp, toggle the mode if ARG is `toggle'.  Enable the
mode if ARG is nil, omitted, or is a positive number.  Disable the mode
if ARG is a negative number.

To check whether the minor mode is enabled in the current buffer,
evaluate the variable `follow-mode'.

(autoload 'format-spec "format-spec" "\
Return a string based on FORMAT and SPECIFICATION.
FORMAT is a string containing `format'-like specs like \"su - %u %k\".
SPECIFICATION is an alist mapping format specification characters
to their substitutions.

For instance:

  (format-spec \"su - %u %l\"
               \\=`((?u . ,(user-login-name))
                 (?l . \"ls\")))

Each %-spec may contain optional flag, width, and precision
specifiers, as follows:

  %<flags><width><precision>character

The following flags are allowed:

* 0: Pad to the width, if given, with zeros instead of spaces.
* -: Pad to the width, if given, on the right instead of the left.
* <: Truncate to the width and precision, if given, on the left.
* >: Truncate to the width and precision, if given, on the right.
* ^: Convert to upper case.
* _: Convert to lower case.

The width and precision specifiers behave like the corresponding
ones in `format' when applied to %s.

For example, \"%<010b\" means \"substitute into the output the
value associated with ?b in SPECIFICATION, either padding it with
leading zeros or truncating leading characters until it's ten
characters wide\".

The substitution for a specification character can also be a
function, taking no arguments and returning a string to be used
for the replacement.  It will only be called if FORMAT uses that
character.  For example:

  (format-spec \"%n\"
               \\=`((?n . ,(lambda ()
                          (read-number \"Number: \")))))

Note that it is best to make sure the function is not quoted,
like above, so that it is compiled by the byte-compiler.

Any text properties of FORMAT are copied to the result, with any
text properties of a %-spec itself copied to its substitution.
However, note that face properties from the two sources are not
merged; the face properties of %-spec override the face properties
of substitutions, if any, in the result.

IGNORE-MISSING indicates how to handle %-spec characters not
present in SPECIFICATION.  If it is nil or omitted, emit an
error; if it is the symbol `ignore', leave those %-specs verbatim
in the result, including their text properties, if any; if it is
the symbol `delete', remove those %-specs from the result;
otherwise do the same as for the symbol `ignore', but also leave
any occurrences of \"%%\" in FORMAT verbatim in the result.

If SPLIT, instead of returning a single string, a list of strings
is returned, where each format spec is its own element.

Alist of frame parameters and filtering functions.

This alist is the default value of the FILTERS argument of
`frameset-save' and `frameset-restore' (which see).

Initially, `frameset-filter-alist' is set to, and shares the value of,
`frameset-persistent-filter-alist'.  You can override any item in
this alist by `push'ing a new item onto it.  If, for some reason, you
intend to modify existing values, do

  (setq frameset-filter-alist (copy-tree frameset-filter-alist))

before changing anything.

On saving, PARAMETERS is the parameter alist of each frame processed,
and FILTERED is the parameter alist that gets saved to the frameset.

On restoring, PARAMETERS is the parameter alist extracted from the
frameset, and FILTERED is the resulting frame parameter alist used
to restore the frame.

Elements of `frameset-filter-alist' are conses (PARAM . ACTION),
where PARAM is a parameter name (a symbol identifying a frame
parameter), and ACTION can be:

 nil       The parameter is copied to FILTERED.
 :never    The parameter is never copied to FILTERED.
 :save     The parameter is copied only when saving the frame.
 :restore  The parameter is copied only when restoring the frame.
 FILTER    A filter function.

FILTER can be a symbol FILTER-FUN, or a list (FILTER-FUN ARGS...).
FILTER-FUN is invoked with

  (apply FILTER-FUN CURRENT FILTERED PARAMETERS SAVING ARGS)

where

 CURRENT     A cons (PARAM . VALUE), where PARAM is the one being
	     filtered and VALUE is its current value.
 FILTERED    The resulting alist (so far).
 PARAMETERS  The complete alist of parameters being filtered,
 SAVING      Non-nil if filtering before saving state, nil if filtering
	       before restoring it.
 ARGS        Any additional arguments specified in the ACTION.

FILTER-FUN is allowed to modify items in FILTERED, but no other arguments.
It must return:
 nil                      Skip CURRENT (do not add it to FILTERED).
 t                        Add CURRENT to FILTERED as is.

PREDICATE is a function called with two arguments, the parameter alist

If PREDICATE returns nil, the frame described by that parameter alist

  t        All existing frames can be reused.
  nil      No existing frame can be reused.
  match    Only frames with matching frame ids can be reused.
  PRED     A predicate function; it receives as argument a live frame,
             and must return non-nil to allow reusing it, nil otherwise.

FORCE-DISPLAY can be:
  t        Frames are restored in the current display.
  nil      Frames are restored, if possible, in their original displays.
  delete   Frames in other displays are deleted instead of restored.
  PRED     A function called with two arguments, the parameter alist and
	     the window state (in that order).  It must return t, nil or
	     `delete', as above but affecting only the frame that will
	     be created from that parameter alist.

FORCE-ONSCREEN can be:
  t        Force onscreen only those frames that are fully offscreen.
  nil      Do not force any frame back onscreen.
  all      Force onscreen any frame fully or partially offscreen.
  PRED     A function called with three arguments,
	   - the live frame just restored,
	   - a list (LEFT TOP WIDTH HEIGHT), describing the frame,
	   - a list (LEFT TOP WIDTH HEIGHT), describing the workarea.
	   It must return non-nil to force the frame onscreen, nil otherwise.

CLEANUP-FRAMES allows \"cleaning up\" the frame list after
restoring a frameset:
  t        Delete all frames that were not created or restored upon.
  nil      Keep all frames.
  FUNC     A function called with two arguments:
           - FRAME, a live frame.
           - ACTION, which can be one of
             :rejected  Frame existed, but was not a candidate for reuse.
             :ignored   Frame existed, was a candidate, but wasn't reused.
             :reused    Frame existed, was a candidate, and restored upon.
             :created   Frame didn't exist, was created and restored upon.
           Return value is ignored.

Note the timing and scope of the operations described above: REUSE-FRAMES
affects existing frames; PREDICATE, FILTERS and FORCE-DISPLAY affect the frame
being restored before that happens; FORCE-ONSCREEN affects the frame once
it has been restored; and CLEANUP-FRAMES affects all frames alive after the
restoration, including those that have been reused or created anew.

A \"generic\" mode is a simple major mode with basic support for
comment syntax and Font Lock mode, but otherwise does not have
any special keystrokes or functionality available.

MODE is the name of the command for the generic mode; don't quote it.
The optional DOCSTRING is the documentation for the mode command.  If
you do not supply it, `define-generic-mode' uses a default
documentation string instead.

COMMENT-LIST is a list in which each element is either a character, a
string of one or two characters, or a cons cell.  A character or a
string is set up in the mode's syntax table as a \"comment starter\".
If the entry is a cons cell, the `car' is set up as a \"comment
starter\" and the `cdr' as a \"comment ender\".  (Use nil for the
latter if you want comments to end at the end of the line.)  Note that
the syntax table has limitations about what comment starters and
enders are actually possible.

KEYWORD-LIST is a list of keywords to highlight with
`font-lock-keyword-face'.  Each keyword should be a string.

FONT-LOCK-LIST is a list of additional expressions to highlight.  Each
element of this list should have the same form as an element of
`font-lock-keywords'.

AUTO-MODE-LIST is a list of regular expressions to add to
`auto-mode-alist'.  These regular expressions are added when Emacs
runs the macro expansion.

FUNCTION-LIST is a list of functions to call to do some additional

mode hook `MODE-hook'.

GROUPS may be a regular expression or a list of group names, that will
be used to select candidate groups.  If it is omitted or nil, all
existing groups are considered.

if NO-CROSSPOST is omitted or nil, a & split will be returned,
otherwise, a | split, that does not allow crossposting, will be
returned.

For each selected group, a SPLIT is composed like this: if SPLIT-SPEC
is specified, this split is returned as-is (unless it is nil: in this
case, the group is ignored).  Otherwise, if TO-ADDRESS, TO-LIST and/or
EXTRA-ALIASES are specified, a regexp that matches any of them is
constructed (extra-aliases may be a list).  Additionally, if
SPLIT-REGEXP is specified, the regexp will be extended so that it
matches this regexp too, and if SPLIT-EXCLUDE is specified, RESTRICT
clauses will be generated.

If CATCH-ALL is nil, no catch-all handling is performed, regardless of
catch-all marks in group parameters.  Otherwise, if there is no
selected group whose SPLIT-REGEXP matches the empty string, nor is
there a selected group whose SPLIT-SPEC is `catch-all', this fancy
split (say, a group name) will be appended to the returned SPLIT list,
as the last element of a `|' SPLIT.

For example, given the following group parameters:

nnml:mail.bar:
((to-address . \"bar@femail.com\")
 (split-regexp . \".*@femail\\\\.com\"))
nnml:mail.foo:
((to-list . \"foo@nowhere.gov\")

 (split-exclude \"bugs-foo\" \"rambling-foo\")
 (admin-address . \"foo-request@nowhere.gov\"))
nnml:mail.others:
((split-spec . catch-all))

Calling (gnus-group-split-fancy nil nil \"mail.others\") returns:

Use special markers to highlight grep matches.

Some grep programs are able to surround matches with special
markers in grep output.  Such markers can be used to highlight
matches in grep mode.  This requires `font-lock-mode' to be active
in grep buffers, so if you have globally disabled `font-lock-mode',
you will not get highlighting.

This option sets the environment variable GREP_COLORS to specify
markers for highlighting and adds the --color option in front of
any explicit grep options before starting the grep.

When this option is `auto', grep uses `--color=auto' to highlight
matches only when it outputs to a terminal (when `grep' is the last
command in the pipe), thus avoiding the use of any potentially-harmful
escape sequences when standard output goes to a file or pipe.

To make grep highlight matches even into a pipe, you need the option
`always' that forces grep to use `--color=always' to unconditionally
output escape sequences.

Movement is as simple as movement in a normal Emacs text buffer.
Most cursor movement bindings are the same: use \\[hexl-backward-char], \\[hexl-forward-char], \\[hexl-next-line], and \\[hexl-previous-line]
to move the cursor left, right, down, and up.

Advanced cursor movement commands (ala \\[hexl-beginning-of-line], \\[hexl-end-of-line], \\[hexl-beginning-of-buffer], and \\[hexl-end-of-buffer]) are
also supported.

There are several ways to change text in hexl mode:

Self-inserting characters are bound to `hexl-self-insert' so you
can simply type the character and it will insert itself (actually
overstrike) into the buffer.  However, inserting non-ASCII characters
requires caution: the buffer's coding-system should correspond to
the encoding on disk, and multibyte characters should be inserted
with cursor on the first byte of a multibyte sequence whose length
is identical to the length of the multibyte sequence to be inserted,
otherwise this could produce invalid multibyte sequences.  Non-ASCII
characters in ISO-2022 encodings should preferably inserted byte by
byte, to avoid problems caused by the designation sequences before
the actual characters.

\\[hexl-quoted-insert] followed by another keystroke allows you to insert the key even if
it isn't bound to self-insert.  An octal number can be supplied in place
of another key to insert the octal number's ASCII representation.

\\[hexl-insert-hex-char] will insert a given hexadecimal value
into the buffer at the current address.

\\[hexl-insert-octal-char] will insert a given octal value
into the buffer at the current address.

\\[hexl-insert-decimal-char] will insert a given decimal value
into the buffer at the current address..

\\[hexl-mode-exit] will exit `hexl-mode'.

Note: saving the file with any of the usual Emacs commands
will actually convert it back to binary format while saving.

You can use \\[hexl-find-file] to visit a file in Hexl mode.

Toggle selective highlighting of patterns (Hi Lock mode).

Hi Lock mode is automatically enabled when you invoke any of the
highlighting commands listed below, such as \\[highlight-regexp].
To enable Hi Lock mode in all buffers, use `global-hi-lock-mode'
or add (global-hi-lock-mode 1) to your init file.

In buffers where Font Lock mode is enabled, patterns are
highlighted using font lock.  In buffers where Font Lock mode is
disabled, patterns are applied using overlays; in this case, the
highlighting will not be updated as you type.  The Font Lock mode
is considered \"enabled\" in a buffer if its `major-mode'
causes `font-lock-specified-p' to return non-nil, which means
the major mode specifies support for Font Lock.

When Hi Lock mode is enabled, a \"Regexp Highlighting\" submenu
is added to the \"Edit\" menu.  The commands in the submenu,
which can be called interactively, are:

\\[highlight-regexp] REGEXP FACE
  Highlight matches of pattern REGEXP in current buffer with FACE.

\\[highlight-phrase] PHRASE FACE
  Highlight matches of phrase PHRASE in current buffer with FACE.
  (PHRASE can be any REGEXP, but spaces will be replaced by matches
  to whitespace and initial lower-case letters will become case insensitive.)

\\[highlight-lines-matching-regexp] REGEXP FACE
  Highlight lines containing matches of REGEXP in current buffer with FACE.

\\[highlight-symbol-at-point]
  Highlight the symbol found near point without prompting, using the next
  available face automatically.

\\[unhighlight-regexp] REGEXP
  Remove highlighting on matches of REGEXP in current buffer.

\\[hi-lock-write-interactive-patterns]
  Write active REGEXPs into buffer as comments (if possible).  They may
  be read the next time file is loaded or when the \\[hi-lock-find-patterns] command
  is issued.  The inserted regexps are in the form of font lock keywords.
  (See `font-lock-keywords'.)  They may be edited and re-loaded with \\[hi-lock-find-patterns],
  any valid `font-lock-keywords' form is acceptable.  When a file is
  loaded the patterns are read if `hi-lock-file-patterns-policy' is
  `always', or if it's `ask' and the user responds y to the prompt,
  or if `hi-lock-file-patterns-policy' is bound to a function and that
  function returns t.

\\[hi-lock-find-patterns]
  Re-read patterns stored in buffer (in the format produced by \\[hi-lock-write-interactive-patterns]).

When hi-lock is started and if the mode is not excluded or patterns
rejected, the beginning of the buffer is searched for lines of the
form:
  Hi-lock: (FOO ...)

where (FOO ...) is a list of patterns.  The patterns must start before
position (number of characters into buffer)
`hi-lock-file-patterns-range'.  Patterns will be read until
Hi-lock: end is found.  A mode is excluded if it's in the list
`hi-lock-exclude-modes'.

This is a minor mode.  If called interactively, toggle the `Hi-Lock

Toggle features to hide/show #ifdef blocks (Hide-Ifdef mode).

\\<hide-ifdef-mode-map>Hide-Ifdef mode is a buffer-local minor mode for use with C and
C-like major modes.  When enabled, code within #ifdef constructs
that the C preprocessor would eliminate may be hidden from view.

Use \\[hide-ifdefs] to hide ifdefs and \\[hide-ifdefs] to show them.
Use  \\[hif-show-all] to show all ifdefs.

Several variables affect how the hiding is done:

`hide-ifdef-env'
        An association list of defined and undefined symbols for the
        current project.  Use \\[hide-ifdef-define] and \\[hide-ifdef-undef] to update the value of
        this list with defined or undefined symbols.
        We've extended hideif to support parsing a C/C++ project
        containing multiple C/C++ source files opened simultaneously in
        different buffers.  Therefore `hide-ifdef-env' can no longer be
        buffer local but must be global.

`hide-ifdef-initially'
        Customize this to a non-nil value to cause ifdefs be hidden as
        soon as `hide-ifdef-mode' is turned on.

`hide-ifdef-lines'
        Customize to non-nil to hide the #if, #ifdef, #ifndef, #else,
        and #endif lines when hiding ifdefs.

`hide-ifdef-define-alist'
        An association list of defined symbol lists.
        Use `hide-ifdef-set-define-alist' to save the current `hide-ifdef-env'
        and `hide-ifdef-use-define-alist' to set the current `hide-ifdef-env'
        from one of the lists in `hide-ifdef-define-alist'.

`hide-ifdef-read-only'
        Set to non-nil if you want to make buffers read only while hiding.
        After `show-ifdefs', read-only status is restored to previous value.

\\{hide-ifdef-mode-map}

disabled.

ARGS becomes the formal parameters of the function.
DOCUMENTATION becomes the docstring of the function.

MARK describes which type of mark (:deletion, or nil) this operation

deletion, otherwise it acts on normally marked buffers.
MODIFIER-P describes how the function modifies buffers.  This is used
to set the modification flag of the Ibuffer buffer itself.  Valid
values are:
 nil - the function never modifiers buffers
 t - the function it always modifies buffers
 :maybe - attempt to discover this information by comparing the
  buffer's modification flag.
DANGEROUS is a boolean which should be set if the user should be
prompted before performing this operation.

CHOICES is a list of strings which are the possible completions.
PREDICATE and INHERIT-INPUT-METHOD are currently ignored; they are included
 to be compatible with `completing-read'.
If REQUIRE-MATCH is non-nil, the user is not allowed to exit unless
 the input is (or completes to) an element of CHOICES or is null.
 If the input is null, `ido-completing-read' returns DEF, or an empty
 string if DEF is nil, regardless of the value of REQUIRE-MATCH.
If INITIAL-INPUT is non-nil, insert it in the minibuffer initially,
 with point positioned at the end.
HIST, if non-nil, specifies a history list.
DEF, if non-nil, is the default value.

element are put in the top level of the buffer index) or a
string (which specifies the title of a submenu into which the
matches are put).
REGEXP is a regular expression matching a definition construct
which is to be displayed in the menu.  REGEXP may also be a
function of no arguments.  If REGEXP is a function, it is
expected to search backwards, return non-nil if it finds a
definition construct, and set `match-data' for that construct.
INDEX is an integer specifying which subexpression of REGEXP
matches the definition's name; this subexpression is displayed as
the menu item.
FUNCTION, if present, specifies a function to call when the index
item is selected by the user.  This function is called with
arguments consisting of the item name, the buffer position, and
the ARGUMENTS.

The variable `imenu-case-fold-search' determines whether or not
the regexp matches are case sensitive, and `imenu-syntax-alist'
can be used to alter the syntax table for the search.

If non-nil this pattern is passed to `imenu--generic-function' to
create a buffer index.

For example, see the value of `fortran-imenu-generic-expression'
used by `fortran-mode' with `imenu-syntax-alist' set locally so that
characters which normally have \"symbol\" syntax are considered to have
\"word\" syntax during matching.")

Selecting other nodes:
\\[Info-mouse-follow-nearest-node]
	Follow a node reference you click on.
	  This works with menu items, cross references, and
	  the \"next\", \"previous\" and \"up\", depending on where you click.

\\[Info-prev]	Move to the \"previous\" node of this node.
\\[Info-up]	Move \"up\" from this node.
\\[Info-menu]	Pick menu item specified by name (or abbreviation).
	  Picking a menu item causes another node to be selected.
\\[Info-directory]	Go to the Info directory node.
\\[Info-top-node]	Go to the Top node of this file.
\\[Info-final-node]	Go to the final node in this file.
\\[Info-backward-node]	Go backward one node, considering all nodes as forming one sequence.

\\[Info-history]	Go to menu of visited nodes.
\\[Info-toc]	Go to table of contents of the current Info file.

Moving within a node:
\\[Info-scroll-up]	Normally, scroll forward a full screen.
	  Once you scroll far enough in a node that its menu appears on the
	  screen but after point, the next scroll moves into its first
	  subnode.  When after all menu items (or if there is no menu),

\\[Info-scroll-down]	Normally, scroll backward.  If the beginning of the buffer is
	  already visible, try to go to the previous menu entry, or up
	  if there is none.
\\[beginning-of-buffer]	Go to beginning of node.
\\[end-of-buffer]	Go to end of node.

Advanced commands:
\\[Info-search]	Search through this Info file for specified regexp,
	  and select the node in which the next occurrence is found.
\\[Info-search-case-sensitively]	Search through this Info file for specified regexp case-sensitively.
\\[isearch-forward], \\[isearch-forward-regexp]	Use Isearch to search through multiple Info nodes.
\\[Info-index]	Search for a topic in this manual's Index and go to index entry.
\\[Info-index-next]	(comma) Move to the next match from a previous \\<Info-mode-map>\\[Info-index] command.
\\[Info-virtual-index]	Look for a string and display the index node with results.

\\[Info-goto-node]	Move to node specified by name.
	  You may include a filename as well, as (FILENAME)NODENAME.
1 .. 9	Pick first ... ninth item in node's menu.
	  Every third `*' is highlighted to help pick the right number.
\\[Info-copy-current-node-name]	Put name of current Info node in the kill ring.
\\[clone-buffer]	Select a new cloned Info buffer in another window.
\\[universal-argument] \\[info]	Move to new Info file with completion.
\\[universal-argument] N \\[info]	Select Info buffer with prefix number in the name *info*<N>.

Let-bind dotted symbols to their cdrs in ALIST and execute BODY.
Dotted symbol is any symbol starting with a `.'.  Only those present

For instance, the following code

  (let-alist alist

essentially expands to

Major mode for editing standard Makefiles.

If you are editing a file for a different make, try one of the

`makefile-makepp-mode', `makefile-bsdmake-mode' or,
`makefile-imake-mode'.  All but the last should be correctly

It is strongly recommended to use `font-lock-mode', because that
provides additional parsing information.  This is used for
example to see that a rule action `echo foo: bar' is a not rule
dependency, despite the colon.

\\{makefile-mode-map}

Makefile mode can be configured by modifying the following variables:

`makefile-target-colon':
    The string that gets appended to all target names
    inserted by `makefile-insert-target'.
    \":\" or \"::\" are quite common values.

`makefile-macro-assign':
   The string that gets appended to all macro names
   inserted by `makefile-insert-macro'.
   The normal value should be \" = \", since this is what
   standard make expects.  However, newer makes such as dmake
   allow a larger variety of different macro assignments, so you
   might prefer to use \" += \" or \" := \" .

`makefile-tab-after-target-colon':
   If you want a TAB (instead of a space) to be appended after the
   target colon, then set this to a non-nil value.

`makefile-pickup-everything-picks-up-filenames-p':
   If this variable is set to a non-nil value then
   `makefile-pickup-everything' also picks up filenames as targets
   (i.e. it calls `makefile-pickup-filenames-as-targets'), otherwise
   filenames are omitted.

`makefile-cleanup-continuations':
   If this variable is set to a non-nil value then Makefile mode
   will assure that no line in the file ends with a backslash
   (the continuation character) followed by any whitespace.
   This is done by silently removing the trailing whitespace, leaving
   the backslash itself intact.
   IMPORTANT: Please note that enabling this option causes Makefile mode
   to MODIFY A FILE WITHOUT YOUR CONFIRMATION when \"it seems necessary\".

Minibuffer Depth Indication mode is a global minor mode.  When

This is a global minor mode.  If called interactively, toggle the

Ranges
======
Many commands that operate on individual messages, such as
`mh-forward' or `mh-refile-msg' take a RANGE argument. This argument
can be used in several ways.

If you provide the prefix argument (\\[universal-argument]) to
these commands, then you will be prompted for the message range.
This can be any valid MH range which can include messages,
sequences, and the abbreviations (described in the mh(1) man
page):

<num1>-<num2>
    Indicates all messages in the range <num1> to <num2>, inclusive.
    The range must be nonempty.

<num>:N
<num>:+N
<num>:-N
    Up to N messages beginning with (or ending with) message num. Num
    may be any of the predefined symbols: first, prev, cur, next or
    last.

first:N
prev:N
next:N
last:N
    The first, previous, next or last messages, if they exist.

all
    All of the messages.

For example, a range that shows all of these things is `1 2 3
5-10 last:5 unseen'.

If the option `transient-mark-mode' is set to t and you set a
region in the MH-Folder buffer, then the MH-E command will
perform the operation on all messages in that region.

(autoload 'open-network-stream "network-stream" "\
Open a TCP connection to HOST, optionally with encryption.
Normally, return a network process object; with a non-nil
:return-list parameter, return a list instead (see below).
Input and output work as for subprocesses; `delete-process'
closes it.

NAME is the name for the process.  It is modified if necessary to
 make it unique.
BUFFER is a buffer or buffer name to associate with the process.
 Process output goes at end of that buffer.  BUFFER may be nil,
 meaning that the process is not associated with any buffer.
HOST is the name or IP address of the host to connect to.
SERVICE is the name of the service desired, or an integer or
 integer string specifying a port number to connect to.

The remaining PARAMETERS should be a sequence of keywords and
values:

:type specifies the connection type, one of the following:
  nil or `network'
             -- Begin with an ordinary network connection, and if
                the parameters :success and :capability-command
                are also supplied, try to upgrade to an encrypted
                connection via STARTTLS.  Even if that
                fails (e.g. if HOST does not support TLS), retain
                an unencrypted connection.
  `plain'    -- An ordinary, unencrypted network connection.
  `starttls' -- Begin with an ordinary connection, and try
                upgrading via STARTTLS.  If that fails for any
                reason, drop the connection; in that case the
                returned object is a killed process.
  `tls'      -- A TLS connection.
  `ssl'      -- Equivalent to `tls'.
  `shell'    -- A shell connection.

:coding is a symbol or a cons used to specify the coding systems
used to decode and encode the data which the process reads and
writes.  See `make-network-process' for details.

:return-list controls the form of the function's return value.
  If omitted or nil, return a process object.  Anything else means to
  return (PROC . PROPS), where PROC is a process object, and PROPS is a
  plist of connection properties, which may include the following
  keywords:
   :greeting -- the greeting returned by HOST (a string), or nil.
   :capabilities -- a string representing HOST's capabilities,
                    or nil if none could be found.
   :type -- the resulting connection type; `plain' (unencrypted)
            or `tls' (TLS-encrypted).
   :error -- A string describing any error when attempting
             to negotiate STARTTLS.

:end-of-command specifies a regexp matching the end of a command.

:end-of-capability specifies a regexp matching the end of the
  response to the command specified for :capability-command.
  It defaults to the regexp specified for :end-of-command.

:success specifies a regexp matching a message indicating a
  successful STARTTLS negotiation.  For instance, the default
  should be \"^3\" for an NNTP connection.

:capability-command specifies a command used to query the HOST
  for its capabilities.  For instance, for IMAP this should be
  \"1 CAPABILITY\\r\\n\".  This can either be a string (which will
  then be sent verbatim to the server), or a function (called with
  a single parameter; the \"greeting\" from the server when connecting),
  and should return a string to send to the server.

:starttls-function specifies a function for handling STARTTLS.
  This function should take one parameter, the response to the
  capability command, and should return the command to switch on
  STARTTLS if the server supports STARTTLS, and nil otherwise.

:always-query-capabilities says whether to query the server for
  capabilities, even if we're doing a `plain' network connection.

:client-certificate should either be a list where the first
  element is the certificate key file name, and the second
  element is the certificate file name itself, or t, which means
  that `auth-source' will be queried for the key and the
  certificate.  This parameter will only be used when doing TLS
  or STARTTLS connections.  To enable automatic queries of
  `auth-source' when `:client-certificate' is not specified
  customize `network-stream-use-client-certificates' to t.

:use-starttls-if-possible is a boolean that says to do opportunistic
STARTTLS upgrades even if Emacs doesn't have built-in TLS functionality.

:warn-unless-encrypted, if non-nil, warn the user if the connection
isn't encrypted (i.e. STARTTLS failed).  Additionally, setting
:return-list non-nil allows capturing any error response.

:nogreeting is a boolean that can be used to inhibit waiting for
a greeting from the server.

:nowait, if non-nil, says the connection should be made
asynchronously, if possible.

:noquery - when exiting Emacs and the network process is running,
don't query the user if it's non-nil.

:shell-command is a `format-spec' string that can be used if
:type is `shell'.  It has two specs, %s for host and %p for port
number.  Example: \"ssh gateway nc %s %p\".

:tls-parameters is a list that should be supplied if you're
opening a TLS connection.  The first element is the TLS
type (either `gnutls-x509pki' or `gnutls-anon'), and the
remaining elements should be a keyword list accepted by
gnutls-boot (as returned by `gnutls-boot-parameters').

\\[nxml-finish-element] finishes the current element by inserting an end-tag.

C-c C-i closes a start-tag with `>' and then inserts a balancing end-tag
leaving point between the start-tag and end-tag.
\\[nxml-balanced-close-start-tag-block] is similar but for block rather than inline elements:
the start-tag, point, and end-tag are all left on separate lines.
If `nxml-slash-auto-complete-flag' is non-nil, then inserting a `</'
automatically inserts the rest of the end-tag.

\\[completion-at-point] performs completion on the symbol preceding point.

\\[nxml-dynamic-markup-word] uses the contents of the current buffer
to choose a tag to put around the word preceding point.

Sections of the document can be displayed in outline form.  The
variable `nxml-section-element-name-regexp' controls when an element
is recognized as a section.  The same key sequences that change
visibility in outline mode are used except that they start with C-c C-o
instead of C-c.

Validation is provided by the related minor-mode `rng-validate-mode'.
This also makes completion schema- and context- sensitive.  Element
names, attribute names, attribute values and namespace URIs can all be
completed. By default, `rng-validate-mode' is automatically enabled.
You can toggle it using \\[rng-validate-mode] or change the default by
customizing `rng-nxml-auto-validate-flag'.

\\[indent-for-tab-command] indents the current line appropriately.
This can be customized using the variable `nxml-child-indent'
and the variable `nxml-attribute-indent'.

\\[nxml-insert-named-char] inserts a character reference using
the character's name (by default, the Unicode name).
\\[universal-argument] \\[nxml-insert-named-char] inserts the character directly.

The Emacs commands that normally operate on balanced expressions will
operate on XML markup items.  Thus \\[forward-sexp] will move forward
across one markup item; \\[backward-sexp] will move backward across
one markup item; \\[kill-sexp] will kill the following markup item;
\\[mark-sexp] will mark the following markup item.  By default, the
complete element is treated as a single markup item; to make each tag be
treated as a separate markup item, set the variable `nxml-sexp-element-flag'
to nil.  For more details, see the function `nxml-forward-balanced-item'.

\\[nxml-backward-up-element] and \\[nxml-down-element] move up and down the element structure.

Many aspects this mode can be customized using
\\[customize-group] nxml RET.

In addition to any hooks its parent mode `text-mode' might have run,
this mode runs the hook `nxml-mode-hook', as the final or penultimate
step during initialization." t)

Show all entries that contain a phrase or words or regular expressions.

TODO entries.  The argument STRING can be used to pass a default search
string into this function.  If EDIT-AT is non-nil, it means that the
user should get a chance to edit this string, with cursor at position
EDIT-AT.

The search string can be viewed either as a phrase that should be found as
is, or it can be broken into a number of snippets, each of which must match
in a Boolean way to select an entry.  The default depends on the variable
`org-agenda-search-view-always-boolean'.
Even if this is turned off (the default) you can always switch to
Boolean search dynamically by preceding the first word with  \"+\" or \"-\".

The default is a direct search of the whole phrase, where each space in
the search string can expand to an arbitrary amount of whitespace,
including newlines.

If using a Boolean search, the search string is split on whitespace and
each snippet is searched separately, with logical AND to select an entry.
Words prefixed with a minus must *not* occur in the entry.  Words without
a prefix or prefixed with a plus must occur in the entry.  Matching is
case-insensitive.  Words are enclosed by word delimiters (i.e. they must
match whole words, not parts of a word) if
`org-agenda-search-view-force-full-words' is set (default is nil).

Boolean search snippets enclosed by curly braces are interpreted as
regular expressions that must or (when preceded with \"-\") must not
match in the entry.  Snippets enclosed into double quotes will be taken
as a whole, to include whitespace.

- If the search string starts with an asterisk, search only in headlines.
- If (possibly after the leading star) the search string starts with an
  exclamation mark, this also means to look at TODO entries only, an effect
  that can also be achieved with a prefix argument.
- If (possibly after star and exclamation mark) the search string starts
  with a colon, this will mean that the (non-regexp) snippets of the
  Boolean search must match as full words.

When point is at the beginning of an empty headline and the variable

When there is a numeric prefix, go up to a heading with level ARG, do

Fetch a package described by PACKAGE and set it up for use with Emacs.

PACKAGE specifies which package to install, where to find its

If PACKAGE is a symbol, install the package with that name
according to metadata that package archives provide for it.  This
is the simplest way to call this function, but it only works if
the package you want to install is listed in a package archive
you have configured.

If PACKAGE is a string, it specifies the URL of the package
repository.  In this case, optional argument BACKEND specifies
the VC backend to use for cloning the repository; if it's nil,
this function tries to infer which backend to use according to
the value of `vc-clone-heuristic-alist' and if that fails it
uses `package-vc-default-backend'.  Optional argument NAME
specifies the package name in this case; if it's nil, this
package uses `file-name-base' on the URL to obtain the package
name, otherwise NAME is the package name as a symbol.

PACKAGE can also be a cons cell (PNAME . SPEC) where PNAME is the
package name as a symbol, and SPEC is a plist that specifies how
to fetch and build the package.  For possible values, see the
subsection \"Specifying Package Sources\" in the Info
node `(emacs)Fetching Package Sources'.

By default, this function installs the last revision of the
package available from its repository.  If REV is a string, it
describes the revision to install, as interpreted by the relevant
VC backend.  The special value `:last-release' (interactively,
the prefix argument), says to use the commit of the latest
release, if it exists.  The last release is the latest revision
which changed the \"Version:\" header of the package's main Lisp
file.

installs takes precedence.

The values returned are identical to those of `decode-time', but
any unknown values other than DST are returned as nil, and an
unknown DST value is returned as -1.
Note that, unlike `decode-time', this function does not interpret
the time string, and in particular the values of DST and TZ do not
affect the returned value of date and time, they only affect the
last two members of the returned value.  This function simply
parses the textual representation of date and time into separate
numerical values, and doesn't care whether the time is local or UTC.

Evaluate EXP to get EXPVAL; try passing control to one of CASES.
CASES is a list of elements of the form (PATTERN CODE...).
For the first CASE whose PATTERN \"matches\" EXPVAL,
evaluate its CODE..., and return the value of the last form.
If no CASE has a PATTERN that matches, return nil.

Each PATTERN expands, in essence, to a predicate to call
on EXPVAL.  When the return value of that call is non-nil,
PATTERN matches.  PATTERN can take one of the forms:

  _                matches anything.
  \\='VAL             matches if EXPVAL is `equal' to VAL.
  KEYWORD          shorthand for \\='KEYWORD
  INTEGER          shorthand for \\='INTEGER
  STRING           shorthand for \\='STRING
  SYMBOL           matches anything and binds it to SYMBOL.
                   If a SYMBOL is used twice in the same pattern
                   the second occurrence becomes an `eq'uality test.
  (pred FUN)       matches if FUN called on EXPVAL returns non-nil.
  (pred (not FUN)) matches if FUN called on EXPVAL returns nil.
  (app FUN PAT)    matches if FUN called on EXPVAL matches PAT.
  (guard BOOLEXP)  matches if BOOLEXP evaluates to non-nil.
  (and PAT...)     matches if all the patterns match.
  (or PAT...)      matches if any of the patterns matches.

FUN in `pred' and `app' can take one of the forms:
  SYMBOL  or  (lambda ARGS BODY)
     call it with one argument
  (F ARG1 .. ARGn)
     call F with ARG1..ARGn and EXPVAL as n+1'th argument
  (F ARG1 .. _ .. ARGn)
     call F, passing EXPVAL at the _ position.

FUN, BOOLEXP, and subsequent PAT can refer to variables
bound earlier in the pattern by a SYMBOL pattern.

Additional patterns can be defined using `pcase-defmacro'.

Emacs Lisp manual for more information and examples.

Variables controlling indentation style:
 `perl-tab-always-indent'
    Non-nil means TAB in Perl mode should always indent the current line,
    regardless of where in the line point is when the TAB command is used.
 `perl-tab-to-comment'
    Non-nil means that for lines which don't need indenting, TAB will
    either delete an empty comment, indent an existing comment, move
    to end-of-line, or if at end-of-line already, create a new comment.
 `perl-nochange'
    Lines starting with this regular expression are not auto-indented.
 `perl-indent-level'
    Indentation of Perl statements within surrounding block.
    The surrounding block's indentation is the indentation
    of the line on which the open-brace appears.
 `perl-continued-statement-offset'
    Extra indentation given to a substatement, such as the
    then-clause of an if or body of a while.
 `perl-continued-brace-offset'
    Extra indentation given to a brace that starts a substatement.
    This is in addition to `perl-continued-statement-offset'.
 `perl-brace-offset'
    Extra indentation for line if it starts with an open brace.
 `perl-brace-imaginary-offset'
    An open brace following other text is treated as if it were
    this far to the right of the start of its line.
 `perl-label-offset'
    Extra indentation for line that is a label.
 `perl-indent-continued-arguments'
    Offset of argument lines relative to usual indentation.

      current active printer.

   \\[universal-argument] 1 \\[pr-ps-fast-fire]
      The command prompts the user for a N-UP value and also for a file name,
      and saves the PostScript image in that file instead of sending it to the
      printer.

   \\[universal-argument] 2 \\[pr-ps-fast-fire]

      PostScript printer and, finally, for a file name.  Then change the active
      printer to that chosen by user and saves the PostScript image in
      that file instead of sending it to the printer.


Noninteractively, the argument N-UP should be a positive integer greater than
zero and the argument SELECT is treated as follows:

   If it's nil, send the image to the printer.

   If it's a list or an integer lesser or equal to zero, the command prompts
   the user for a current PostScript printer, then printing will immediately
   be done using the new current active printer.

   If it's an integer equal to 1, the command prompts the user for a file name
   and saves the PostScript image in that file instead of sending it to the
   printer.

   If it's an integer greater or equal to 2, the command prompts the user for a
   current PostScript printer and for a file name.  Then change the active
   printer to that chosen by user and saves the PostScript image in that file
   instead of sending it to the printer.

   If it's a symbol which it's defined in `pr-ps-printer-alist', it's the new
   active printer and printing will immediately be done using the new active
   printer.

 FORGET-LAST-SELECTION, DETERMINISTIC, KBD-TRANSLATE, SHOW-LAYOUT,
 CREATE-DECODE-MAP, MAXIMUM-SHORTEST, OVERLAY-PLIST,
 UPDATE-TRANSLATION-FUNCTION, CONVERSION-KEYS and SIMPLE.

GUIDANCE specifies how a guidance string is shown in echo area.
If it is t, list of all possible translations for the current key is shown
 with the currently selected translation being highlighted.
If it is an alist, the element has the form (CHAR . STRING).  Each character
 in the current key is searched in the list and the corresponding string is
 shown.
If it is nil, the current key is shown.

DOCSTRING is the documentation string of this package.  The command
`describe-input-method' shows this string while replacing the form
\\=\\=\\=\\<VAR> in the string by the value of VAR.  That value should be a
string.  For instance, the form \\=\\=\\=\\<quail-translation-docstring> is
replaced by a description about how to select a translation from a
list of candidates.

TRANSLATION-KEYS specifies additional key bindings used while translation
region is active.  It is an alist of single key character vs. corresponding
command to be called.

FORGET-LAST-SELECTION non-nil means a selected translation is not kept
for the future to translate the same key.  If this flag is nil, a
translation selected for a key is remembered so that it can be the
first candidate when the same key is entered later.

DETERMINISTIC non-nil means the first candidate of translation is
selected automatically without allowing users to select another
translation for a key.  In this case, unselected translations are of
no use for an interactive use of Quail but can be used by some other
programs.  If this flag is non-nil, FORGET-LAST-SELECTION is also set
to t.

KBD-TRANSLATE non-nil means input characters are translated from a
user's keyboard layout to the standard keyboard layout.  See the
documentation of `quail-keyboard-layout' and
`quail-keyboard-layout-standard' for more detail.

SHOW-LAYOUT non-nil means the function `quail-help' (as used by
the command `describe-input-method') should show the user's keyboard
layout visually with translated characters.  If KBD-TRANSLATE is
set, it is desirable to also set this flag, unless this package
defines no translations for single character keys.

CREATE-DECODE-MAP non-nil means decode map is also created.  A decode
map is an alist of translations and corresponding original keys.
Although this map is not used by Quail itself, it can be used by some
other programs.  For instance, Vietnamese supporting needs this map to
convert Vietnamese text to VIQR format which uses only ASCII
characters to represent Vietnamese characters.

MAXIMUM-SHORTEST non-nil means break key sequence to get maximum
length of the shortest sequence.  When we don't have a translation of
key \"..ABCD\" but have translations of \"..AB\" and \"CD..\", break
the key at \"..AB\" and start translation of \"CD..\".  Hangul
packages, for instance, use this facility.  If this flag is nil, we
break the key just at \"..ABC\" and start translation of \"D..\".

OVERLAY-PLIST if non-nil is a property list put on an overlay which
covers Quail translation region.

UPDATE-TRANSLATION-FUNCTION if non-nil is a function to call to update
the current translation region according to a new translation data.  By
default, a translated text or a user's key sequence (if no translation
for it) is inserted.

CONVERSION-KEYS specifies additional key bindings used while
conversion region is active.  It is an alist of single key character
vs. corresponding command to be called.

If SIMPLE is non-nil, then we do not alter the meanings of
commands such as \\[forward-char], \\[backward-char], \\[next-line], \\[previous-line] and \\[indent-for-tab-command]; they are treated as
non-Quail commands.

goes to the first error in the buffer.  If the buffer changes, then it
will be automatically rechecked when Emacs becomes idle; the
rechecking will be paused whenever there is input pending.

By default, uses a vacuous schema that allows any well-formed XML
document.  A schema can be specified explicitly using
\\[rng-set-schema-file-and-validate], or implicitly based on the buffer's

If `mail-archive-file-name' is non-nil, an Fcc field with that file name
is inserted.

The normal hook `mail-setup-hook' is run after the message is
initialized.  It can add more default fields to the message.

The first argument, NOERASE, determines what to do when there is
an existing modified `*mail*' buffer.  If NOERASE is nil, the
existing mail buffer is used, and the user is prompted whether to
keep the old contents or to erase them.  If NOERASE has the value
`new', a new mail buffer will be created instead of using the old
one.  Any other non-nil value means to always select the old
buffer without erasing the contents.

The second through fifth arguments,
 TO, SUBJECT, IN-REPLY-TO and CC, specify if non-nil
 the initial contents of those header fields.
 These arguments should not have final newlines.
The sixth argument REPLYBUFFER is a buffer which contains an
 original message being replied to, or else an action
 of the form (FUNCTION . ARGS) which says how to insert the original.

The seventh argument ACTIONS is a list of actions to take

Major mode for Simple Emacs Spreadsheet.

When you invoke SES in a new buffer, it is divided into cells
that you can enter data into.  You can navigate the cells with
the arrow keys and add more cells with the tab key.  The contents
of these cells can be numbers, text, or Lisp expressions.  (To
enter text, enclose it in double quotes.)

In an expression, you can use cell coordinates to refer to the
contents of another cell.  For example, you can sum a range of
cells with `(+ A1 A2 A3)'.  There are specialized functions like
`ses+' (addition for ranges with empty cells), `ses-average' (for
performing calculations on cells), and `ses-range' and `ses-select'
(for extracting ranges of cells).

Each cell also has a print function that controls how it is
displayed.

Each SES buffer is divided into a print area and a data area.
Normally, you can simply use SES to look at and manipulate the print
area, and let SES manage the data area outside the visible region.

See \"ses-example.ses\" (in `data-directory') for an example
spreadsheet, and the Info node `(ses)Top.'

To write fairly well formatted pages you only need to know few things.  Most
browsers have a function to read the source code of the page being seen, so
you can imitate various tricks.  Here's a very short HTML primer which you
can also view with a browser to see what happens:

<title>A Title Describing Contents</title> should be on every page.  Pages can
have <h1>Very Major Headlines</h1> through <h6>Very Minor Headlines</h6>
<hr> Parts can be separated with horizontal rules.

<p>Paragraphs only need an opening tag.  Line breaks and multiple
spaces are ignored unless the text is <pre>preformatted.</pre>
Text can be marked as <strong>bold</strong>, <em>italic</em> or
<u>underlined</u> using the facemenu M-o or Edit/Text
Properties/Face commands.

Pages can have <a name=\"SOMENAME\">named points</a> and can link other points
to them with <a href=\"#SOMENAME\">see also somename</a>.  In the same way <a
href=\"URL\">see also URL</a> where URL is a filename relative to current
directory, or absolute as in `https://www.cs.indiana.edu/elisp/w3/docs.html'.

Images in many formats can be inlined with <img src=\"URL\">.

If you mainly create your own documents, `sgml-specials' might be
interesting.  But note that some HTML 2 browsers can't handle `&apos;'.

Major mode for editing shell scripts.
This mode works for many shells, since they all have roughly the same syntax,
as far as commands, arguments, variables, pipes, comments etc. are concerned.
Unless the file's magic number indicates the shell, your usual shell is
assumed.  Since filenames rarely give a clue, they are not further analyzed.

This mode adapts to the variations between shells (see `sh-set-shell') by
means of an inheritance based feature lookup (see `sh-feature').  This
mechanism applies to all variables (including skeletons) that pertain to
shell-specific features.  Shell script files can use the `sh-shell' local
variable to indicate the shell variant to be used for the file.

The default style of this mode is that of Rosenblatt's Korn shell book.
The syntax of the statements varies with the shell being used.  The
following commands are available, based on the current shell's syntax:
\\<sh-mode-map>
\\[sh-case]	 case statement
\\[sh-for]	 for loop
\\[sh-function]	 function definition
\\[sh-if]	 if statement
\\[sh-indexed-loop]	 indexed loop from 1 to n
\\[sh-while-getopts]	 while getopts loop
\\[sh-repeat]	 repeat loop
\\[sh-select]	 select loop
\\[sh-until]	 until loop
\\[sh-while]	 while loop

For sh and rc shells indentation commands are:
\\[smie-config-show-indent]	Show the rules controlling this line's indentation.
\\[smie-config-set-indent]	Change the rules controlling this line's indentation.
\\[smie-config-guess]  Try to tweak the indentation rules so the
buffer indents as it currently is indented.


\\[backward-delete-char-untabify]	 Delete backward one position, even if it was a tab.
\\[sh-end-of-command]	 Go to end of successive commands.
\\[sh-beginning-of-command]	 Go to beginning of successive commands.
\\[sh-set-shell]	 Set this buffer's shell, and maybe its magic number.
\\[sh-execute-region]	 Have optional header and region be executed in a subshell.

`sh-electric-here-document-mode' controls whether insertion of two
unquoted < insert a here document.  You can control this behavior by
modifying `sh-mode-hook'.

If you generally program a shell different from your login shell you can
set `sh-shell-file' accordingly.  If your shell's file name doesn't correctly
indicate what shell it is use `sh-alias-alist' to translate.

If your shell gives error messages with line numbers, you can use \\[executable-interpret]

(autoload 'list-load-path-shadows "shadow" "\
Display a list of Emacs Lisp files that shadow other files.

If STRINGP is non-nil, returns any shadows as a string.
Otherwise, if interactive shows any shadows in a `*Shadows*' buffer;
else prints messages listing any shadows.

This function lists potential load path problems.  Directories in
the `load-path' variable are searched, in order, for Emacs Lisp
files.  When a previously encountered file name is found again, a
message is displayed indicating that the later file is \"hidden\" by
the earlier.

For example, suppose `load-path' is set to

(\"/usr/share/emacs/site-lisp\" \"/usr/share/emacs/24.3/lisp\")

and that each of these directories contains a file called XXX.el.  Then
XXX.el in the site-lisp directory is referred to by all of:
(require \\='XXX), (autoload .... \"XXX\"), (load-library \"XXX\") etc.

The first XXX.el file prevents Emacs from seeing the second (unless
the second is loaded explicitly via `load-file').

When not intended, such shadowings can be the source of subtle
problems.  For example, the above situation may have arisen because the
XXX package was not distributed with versions of Emacs prior to
24.3.  A system administrator downloaded XXX from elsewhere and installed
it.  Later, XXX was updated and included in the Emacs distribution.
Unless the system administrator checks for this, the new version of XXX
will be hidden behind the old (which may no longer work with the new
Emacs version).

This function performs these checks and flags all possible
shadowings.  Because a .el file may exist without a corresponding .elc
(or vice-versa), these suffixes are essentially ignored.  A file
XXX.elc in an early directory (that does not contain XXX.el) is
considered to shadow a later file XXX.el, and vice-versa.

Shadowings are located by calling the (non-interactive) companion
function, `load-path-shadows-find'.

An interregion is the stretch of text between two contiguous marked

alphabetical order, the 3 interregions are simply the last 3 regions.
But if you marked B A [] C, the interregions are B-A, A-[], []-C.

The optional third argument STR, if specified, is the value for the

interactor gets ignored, and this should be a valid skeleton element.

When done with skeleton, but before going back to `_'-point, add
a newline (unless `skeleton-end-newline' is nil) and run the hook
`skeleton-end-hook'.

SKELETON is made up as (INTERACTOR ELEMENT ...).  INTERACTOR may be nil if
not needed, a prompt-string or an expression for complex read functions.

If ELEMENT is a string or a character it gets inserted (see also
`skeleton-transformation-function').  Other possibilities are:

	\\n	go to next line and indent according to mode, unless
                this is the first/last element of a skeleton and point
                is at bol/eol

		interesting point set by _
	>	indent line (or interregion if > _) according to major mode
	@	add position to `skeleton-positions'
	&	do next ELEMENT if previous moved point
	|	do next ELEMENT if previous didn't move point
	-NUM	delete NUM preceding characters (see `skeleton-untabify')
	resume:	skipped, continue here if quit is signaled
	nil	skipped

After termination, point will be positioned at the last occurrence of -
or at the first occurrence of _ or at the end of the inserted text.

Note that \\n as the last element of the skeleton only inserts a
newline if not at eol.  If you want to unconditionally insert a newline
at the end of the skeleton, use \"\\n\" instead.  Likewise with \\n
as the first element when at bol.

Further elements can be defined via `skeleton-further-elements'.
ELEMENT may itself be a SKELETON with an INTERACTOR.  The user is prompted
repeatedly for different inputs.  The SKELETON is processed as often as
the user enters a non-empty string.  \\[keyboard-quit] terminates skeleton insertion, but
continues after `resume:' and positions at `_' if any.  If INTERACTOR in
such a subskeleton is a prompt-string which contains a \".. %s ..\" it is
formatted with `skeleton-subprompt'.  Such an INTERACTOR may also be a list
of strings with the subskeleton being repeated once for each string.

Quoted Lisp expressions are evaluated for their side-effects.
Other Lisp expressions are evaluated and the value treated as above.
Note that expressions may not return t since this implies an
endless loop.  Modes can define other symbols by locally setting them
to any valid skeleton element.  The following local variables are
available:

	str	first time: read a string according to INTERACTOR

Toggle automated performance mitigation for files with long lines.

Many Emacs modes struggle with buffers which contain excessively long lines,
and may consequently cause unacceptable performance issues.

This is commonly on account of \"minified\" code (i.e. code that has been
compacted into the smallest file size possible, which often entails removing
newlines should they not be strictly necessary).

When such files are detected by `so-long-predicate', we invoke the selected
`so-long-action' to mitigate potential performance problems in the buffer.

Use \\[so-long-commentary] for more information.

Use \\[so-long-customize] to open the customization group `so-long' to
configure the behavior.

This is a global minor mode.  If called interactively, toggle the
`Global So-Long mode' mode.  If the prefix argument is positive, enable
the mode, and if it is zero or negative, disable the mode.

If called from Lisp, toggle the mode if ARG is `toggle'.  Enable the
mode if ARG is nil, omitted, or is a positive number.  Disable the mode
if ARG is a negative number.

To check whether the minor mode is enabled in the current buffer,
evaluate `(default-value \\='global-so-long-mode)'.

The mode's hook is called both when the mode is enabled and when it is
disabled.

What is Solitaire?

I don't know who invented this game, but it seems to be rather old and
its origin seems to be northern Africa.  Here's how to play:
Initially, the board will look similar to this:

	Le Solitaire
	============

		o   o   o

		o   o   o

	o   o   o   o   o   o   o

	o   o   o   .   o   o   o

	o   o   o   o   o   o   o

		o   o   o

		o   o   o

Let's call the o's stones and the .'s holes.  One stone fits into one
hole.  As you can see, all holes but one are occupied by stones.  The
aim of the game is to get rid of all but one stone, leaving that last
one in the middle of the board if you're cool.

A stone can be moved if there is another stone next to it, and a hole
after that one.  Thus there must be three fields in a row, either
horizontally or vertically, up, down, left or right, which look like
this:  o  o  .

Then the first stone is moved to the hole, jumping over the second,
which therefore is taken away.  The above thus `evaluates' to:  .  .  o

That's all.  Here's the board after two moves:

		o   o   o

		.   o   o

	o   o   .   o   o   o   o

	o   .   o   o   o   o   o

	o   o   o   o   o   o   o

		o   o   o

		o   o   o

General text sorting routine to divide buffer into records and sort them.

We divide the accessible portion of the buffer into disjoint pieces
called sort records.  A portion of each sort record (perhaps all of
it) is designated as the sort key.  The records are rearranged in the
buffer in order by their sort keys.  The records may or may not be
contiguous.

Usually the records are rearranged in order of ascending sort key.
If REVERSE is non-nil, they are rearranged in order of descending sort key.
The variable `sort-fold-case' determines whether alphabetic case affects
the sort order.

The next four arguments are functions to be called to move point
across a sort record.  They will be called many times from within `sort-subr'.

NEXTRECFUN is called with point at the end of the previous record.
It moves point to the start of the next record.
It should move point to the end of the buffer if there are no more records.
The first record is assumed to start at the position of point when `sort-subr'
is called.

ENDRECFUN is called with point within the record.
It should move point to the end of the record.

STARTKEYFUN moves from the start of the record to the start of the key.
It may return either a non-nil value to be used as the key, or
else the key is the substring between the values of point after
STARTKEYFUN and ENDKEYFUN are called.  If STARTKEYFUN is nil, the key
starts at the beginning of the record.

ENDKEYFUN moves from the start of the sort key to the end of the sort key.
ENDKEYFUN may be nil if STARTKEYFUN returns a value or if it would be the
same as ENDRECFUN.

PREDICATE, if non-nil, is the predicate function for comparing
keys; it is called with two arguments, the keys to compare, and
should return non-nil if the first key should sort before the
second key.  If PREDICATE is nil, comparison is done with `<' if
the keys are numbers, with `compare-buffer-substrings' if the
keys are cons cells (the car and cdr of each cons cell are taken
as start and end positions), and with `string<' otherwise.

RECORD-REGEXP specifies the textual units to be sorted.
  For example, to sort lines, RECORD-REGEXP would be \"^.*$\".

KEY-REGEXP specifies the part of each record (i.e. each match for
  RECORD-REGEXP) to be used for sorting.
  If it is \"\\\\digit\", use the digit'th \"\\\\(...\\\\)\"
  match field specified by RECORD-REGEXP.
  If it is \"\\\\&\", use the whole record.
  Otherwise, KEY-REGEXP should be a regular expression with which

The variable `sort-fold-case' determines whether alphabetic case affects

For example: to sort lines in the region by the first word on each line

Toggle mouse support in GNU/Linux consoles (GPM Mouse mode).

This allows the use of the mouse when operating on a GNU/Linux console,

It relies on the `gpm' daemon being activated.

Note that when `gpm-mouse-mode' is enabled, you cannot use the

Insert an editable text table.
Insert a table of specified number of COLUMNS and ROWS.  Optional

\\[table-insert] inserts a table at the current point location.

Suppose we have the following situation where `-!-' indicates the
location of point.

Type \\[table-insert] and hit ENTER key.  As it asks table

Travel cells forward while inserting a specified sequence string in each cell.
STR is the base string from which the sequence starts.  When STR is an
empty string then each cell content is erased.  When STR ends with
numerical characters (they may optionally be surrounded by a pair of
parentheses) they are incremented as a decimal number.  Otherwise the
last character in STR is incremented in ASCII code order.  N is the
number of sequence elements to insert.  When N is negative the cell
traveling direction is backward.  When N is zero it travels forward
entire table.  INCREMENT is the increment between adjacent sequence
elements and can be a negative number for effectively decrementing.
INTERVAL is the number of cells to travel between sequence element
insertion which is normally 1.  When zero or less is given for
INTERVAL it is interpreted as number of cells per row so that sequence
is placed straight down vertically as long as the table's cell
structure is uniform.  JUSTIFY is a symbol `left', `center' or
`right' that specifies justification of the inserted string.

specified as 5.

+-----+-----+-----+-----+
|  1  |  2  |  3  |  4  |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+
|  5  |  6  |  7  |  8  |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+
|     |  9  | 10  |     |
+-----+-----+-----+-----+

Note:

In case the function is called interactively user must use \\[quoted-insert] `quoted-insert'
in order to enter \"\\n\" successfully.  COL-DELIM-REGEXP at the end
of each row is optional.


Example 2:

This example shows how a table can be used for text layout editing.
Let `table-capture' capture the following region starting from
-!- and ending at -*-, that contains three paragraphs and two item
name headers.  This time specify empty string for both
COL-DELIM-REGEXP and ROW-DELIM-REGEXP.

-!-`table-capture' is a powerful command however mastering its power
requires some practice.  Here is a list of items what it can do.

Parse Cell Items      By using column delimiter regular
		      expression and raw delimiter regular
		      expression, it parses the specified text
		      area and extracts cell items from
		      non-table text and then forms a table out
		      of them.

Capture Text Area     When no delimiters are specified it
		      creates a single cell table.  The text in
		      the specified region is placed in that
		      cell.-*-

Now the entire content is captured in a cell which is itself a table
like this.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------+

By splitting the cell appropriately we now have a table consisting of
paragraphs occupying its own cell.  Each cell can now be edited
independently.

Major mode for editing Texinfo files.

  It has these extra commands:
\\{texinfo-mode-map}

  These are files that are used as input for TeX to make printed manuals
and also to be turned into Info files with \\[makeinfo-buffer] or
the `makeinfo' program.  These files must be written in a very restricted and
modified version of TeX input format.

  Editing commands are like `text-mode' except that the syntax table is
set up so expression commands skip Texinfo bracket groups.  To see
what the Info version of a region of the Texinfo file will look like,
use \\[makeinfo-region], which runs `makeinfo' on the current region.

  You can show the structure of a Texinfo file with \\[texinfo-show-structure].
This command shows the structure of a Texinfo file by listing the
lines with the @-sign commands for @chapter, @section, and the like.
These lines are displayed in another window called the *Occur* window.
In that window, you can position the cursor over one of the lines and
use \\[occur-mode-goto-occurrence], to jump to the corresponding spot
in the Texinfo file.

  In addition, Texinfo mode provides commands that insert various
frequently used @-sign commands into the buffer.  You can use these
commands to save keystrokes.  And you can insert balanced braces with
\\[texinfo-insert-braces] and later use the command \\[up-list] to
move forward past the closing brace.

Also, Texinfo mode provides functions for automatically creating or
updating menus and node pointers.  These functions

  * insert the `Next', `Previous' and `Up' pointers of a node,
  * insert or update the menu for a section, and
  * create a master menu for a Texinfo source file.

Here are the functions:

    `texinfo-update-node'                \\[texinfo-update-node]
    `texinfo-every-node-update'          \\[texinfo-every-node-update]
    `texinfo-sequential-node-update'

    `texinfo-make-menu'                  \\[texinfo-make-menu]
    `texinfo-all-menus-update'           \\[texinfo-all-menus-update]
    `texinfo-master-menu'

    `texinfo-indent-menu-description' (column &optional region-p)

The `texinfo-column-for-description' variable specifies the column to
which menu descriptions are indented.

Passed an argument (a prefix argument, if interactive), the
`texinfo-update-node' and `texinfo-make-menu' functions do their jobs
in the region.

To use the updating commands, you must structure your Texinfo file
hierarchically, such that each `@node' line, with the exception of the
Top node, is accompanied by some kind of section line, such as an
`@chapter' or `@section' line.

If the file has a `top' node, it must be called `top' or `Top' and
be the first node in the file.

Entering Texinfo mode calls the value of `text-mode-hook', and then the
value of `texinfo-mode-hook'." t)

Enable or disable typing-break mode.

This is a minor mode, but it is global to all buffers by default.

When this mode is enabled, the user is encouraged to take typing breaks at
appropriate intervals; either after a specified amount of time or when the
user has exceeded a keystroke threshold.  When the time arrives, the user
is asked to take a break.  If the user refuses at that time, Emacs will ask
again in a short period of time.  The idea is to give the user enough time
to find a good breaking point in his or her work, but be sufficiently
annoying to discourage putting typing breaks off indefinitely.

The user may enable or disable this mode by setting the variable of the
same name, though setting it in that way doesn't reschedule a break or
reset the keystroke counter.

If the mode was previously disabled and is enabled as a consequence of
calling this function, it schedules a break with `type-break-schedule' to
make sure one occurs (the user can call that command to reschedule the
break at any time).  It also initializes the keystroke counter.

The variable `type-break-interval' specifies the number of seconds to
schedule between regular typing breaks.  This variable doesn't directly
affect the time schedule; it simply provides a default for the
`type-break-schedule' command.

If set, the variable `type-break-good-rest-interval' specifies the minimum
amount of time which is considered a reasonable typing break.  Whenever
that time has elapsed, typing breaks are automatically rescheduled for
later even if Emacs didn't prompt you to take one first.  Also, if a break
is ended before this much time has elapsed, the user will be asked whether
or not to continue.  A nil value for this variable prevents automatic
break rescheduling, making `type-break-interval' an upper bound on the time
between breaks.  In this case breaks will be prompted for as usual before
the upper bound if the keystroke threshold is reached.

If `type-break-good-rest-interval' is nil and
`type-break-good-break-interval' is set, then confirmation is required to
interrupt a break before `type-break-good-break-interval' seconds
have passed.  This provides for an upper bound on the time between breaks
together with confirmation of interruptions to these breaks.

The variable `type-break-keystroke-threshold' is used to determine the
thresholds at which typing breaks should be considered.  You can use
the command `type-break-guesstimate-keystroke-threshold' to try to
approximate good values for this.

There are several variables that affect how or when warning messages about
imminent typing breaks are displayed.  They include:

        `type-break-mode-line-message-mode'
        `type-break-time-warning-intervals'
        `type-break-keystroke-warning-intervals'
        `type-break-warning-repeat'
        `type-break-warning-countdown-string'
        `type-break-warning-countdown-string-type'

There are several variables that affect if, how, and when queries to begin
a typing break occur.  They include:

        `type-break-query-mode'
        `type-break-query-function'
        `type-break-query-interval'

The command `type-break-statistics' prints interesting things.

Finally, a file (named `type-break-file-name') is used to store information
across Emacs sessions.  This provides recovery of the break status between
sessions and after a crash.  Manual changes to the file may result in
problems.

This is a global minor mode.  If called interactively, toggle the
`Type-Break mode' mode.  If the prefix argument is positive, enable the
mode, and if it is zero or negative, disable the mode.

If called from Lisp, toggle the mode if ARG is `toggle'.  Enable the
mode if ARG is nil, omitted, or is a positive number.  Disable the mode
if ARG is a negative number.

To check whether the minor mode is enabled in the current buffer,
evaluate `(default-value \\='type-break-mode)'.

The mode's hook is called both when the mode is enabled and when it is
disabled.

Guess values for the minimum/maximum keystroke threshold for typing breaks.

If called interactively, the user is prompted for their guess as to how
many words per minute they usually type.  This value should not be your
maximum WPM, but your average.  Of course, this is harder to gauge since it
can vary considerably depending on what you are doing.  For example, one
tends to type less when debugging a program as opposed to writing
documentation.  (Perhaps a separate program should be written to estimate
average typing speed.)

From that, this command sets the values in `type-break-keystroke-threshold'
based on a fairly simple algorithm involving assumptions about the average
length of words (5).  For the minimum threshold, it uses about a fifth of
the computed maximum threshold.

When called from Lisp programs, the optional args WORDLEN and FRAC can be
used to override the default assumption about average word length and the
fraction of the maximum threshold to which to set the minimum threshold.
FRAC should be the inverse of the fractional value; for example, a value of
2 would mean to use one half, a value of 4 would mean to use one quarter, etc.

:bind-keymap*    Like `:bind-keymap', but overrides all minor mode bindings

:disabled        The package is ignored completely if this keyword is present.
:defines         Declare certain variables to silence the byte-compiler.
:functions       Declare certain functions to silence the byte-compiler.
:load-path       Add to the `load-path' before attempting to load the package.
:diminish        Support for diminish.el (if installed).

For modern merging-based version control systems:
  If every file in the fileset is not registered for version

This command creates a buffer that shows, for each line of the current

youngest, and intermediate colors indicate intermediate ages.  By
default, the time scale stretches back one year into the past;
everything that is older than that is shown in blue.

With a prefix argument, this command asks two questions in the
minibuffer.  First, you may enter a revision number REV; then the buffer
displays and annotates that revision instead of the working revision
(type RET in the minibuffer to leave that default unchanged).  Then,
you are prompted for the time span in days which the color range
should cover.  For example, a time span of 20 days means that changes
over the past 20 days are shown in red to blue, according to their
age, and everything that is older than that is shown in blue.

Usage:
------

  INDENTATION:  Typing `TAB' at the beginning of a line indents the line.
    The amount of indentation is specified by option `vera-basic-offset'.
    Indentation can be done for an entire region (`M-C-\\') or buffer (menu).
    `TAB' always indents the line if option `vera-intelligent-tab' is nil.

  WORD/COMMAND COMPLETION:  Typing `TAB' after a (not completed) word looks
    for a word in the buffer or a Vera keyword that starts alike, inserts it
    and adjusts case.  Re-typing `TAB' toggles through alternative word
    completions.

    Typing `TAB' after a non-word character inserts a tabulator stop (if not
    at the beginning of a line).  `M-TAB' always inserts a tabulator stop.

  COMMENTS:  `C-c C-c' comments out a region if not commented out, and
    uncomments a region if already commented out.

  HIGHLIGHTING (fontification):  Vera keywords, predefined types and
    constants, function names, declaration names, directives, as well as
    comments and strings are highlighted using different colors.

  VERA VERSION:  OpenVera 1.4 and Vera version 6.2.8.

   the begin is lined up with the preceding token.  If t, you get:
      if (a)
         begin // amount of indent based on `verilog-cexp-indent'
   otherwise you get:
      if (a)
      begin
 `verilog-indent-class-inside-pkg'  (default t)
   Non-nil means indent classes inside packages.
   Otherwise, classes have zero indentation.
 `verilog-auto-endcomments'         (default t)
   Non-nil means a comment /* ... */ is set after the ends which ends
   cases, tasks, functions and modules.
   The type and name of the object will be set between the braces.
 `verilog-minimum-comment-distance' (default 10)
   Minimum distance (in lines) between begin and end required before a comment
   will be inserted.  Setting this variable to zero results in every
   end acquiring a comment; the default avoids too many redundant
   comments in tight quarters.
 `verilog-align-decl-expr-comments' (default t)
   Non-nil means align declaration and expressions comments.
 `verilog-align-comment-distance'   (default 1)
   Distance (in spaces) between longest declaration and comments.
   Only works if `verilog-align-decl-expr-comments' is non-nil.
 `verilog-align-assign-expr'        (default nil)
   Non-nil means align expressions of continuous assignments.
 `verilog-align-typedef-regexp'     (default nil)
   Regexp that matches user typedefs for declaration alignment.
 `verilog-align-typedef-words'      (default nil)
   List of words that match user typedefs for declaration alignment.
 `verilog-auto-lineup'              (default `declarations')
   List of contexts where auto lineup of code should be done.

Variables controlling other actions:

 `verilog-linter'                   (default `none')
   Unix program to call to run the lint checker.  This is the default
   command for \\[compile-command] and \\[verilog-auto-save-compile].

;;; Generated autoloads from progmodes/vhdl-mode.el

(autoload 'vhdl-mode "vhdl-mode" "\
Major mode for editing VHDL code.

Usage:
------

  TEMPLATE INSERTION (electrification):
    After typing a VHDL keyword and entering `SPC', you are prompted for
    arguments while a template is generated for that VHDL construct.  Typing
    `RET' or `C-g' at the first (mandatory) prompt aborts the current
    template generation.  Optional arguments are indicated by square
    brackets and removed if the queried string is left empty.  Prompts for
    mandatory arguments remain in the code if the queried string is left
    empty.  They can be queried again by `C-c C-t C-q'.  Enabled
    electrification is indicated by `/e' in the mode line.

      Typing `M-SPC' after a keyword inserts a space without calling the
    template generator.  Automatic template generation (i.e.
    electrification) can be disabled (enabled) by typing `C-c C-m C-e' or by
    setting option `vhdl-electric-mode' (see OPTIONS).

      Template generators can be invoked from the VHDL menu, by key
    bindings, by typing `C-c C-i C-c' and choosing a construct, or by typing
    the keyword (i.e. first word of menu entry not in parenthesis) and
    `SPC'.  The following abbreviations can also be used: arch, attr, cond,
    conf, comp, cons, func, inst, pack, sig, var.

      Template styles can be customized in customization group
    `vhdl-template' (see OPTIONS).


  HEADER INSERTION:
    A file header can be inserted by `C-c C-t C-h'.  A file footer
    (template at the end of the file) can be inserted by `C-c C-t C-f'.
    See customization group `vhdl-header'.


  STUTTERING:
    Double striking of some keys inserts cumbersome VHDL syntax elements.
    Stuttering can be disabled (enabled) by typing `C-c C-m C-s' or by
    option `vhdl-stutter-mode'.  Enabled stuttering is indicated by `/s' in
    the mode line.  The stuttering keys and their effects are:

      ;;   -->  \" : \"       [   -->  (        --    -->  comment
      ;;;  -->  \" := \"      [[  -->  [        --CR  -->  comment-out code
      ..   -->  \" => \"      ]   -->  )        ---   -->  horizontal line
      ,,   -->  \" <= \"      ]]  -->  ]        ----  -->  display comment
      ==   -->  \" == \"      \\='\\='  -->  \\\"


  WORD COMPLETION:
    Typing `TAB' after a (not completed) word looks for a VHDL keyword or a
    word in the buffer that starts alike, inserts it and adjusts case.
    Re-typing `TAB' toggles through alternative word completions.  This also
    works in the minibuffer (i.e. in template generator prompts).

      Typing `TAB' after `(' looks for and inserts complete parenthesized
    expressions (e.g. for array index ranges).  All keywords as well as
    standard types and subprograms of VHDL have predefined abbreviations
    (e.g., type \"std\" and `TAB' will toggle through all standard types
    beginning with \"std\").

      Typing `TAB' after a non-word character indents the line if at the
    beginning of a line (i.e. no preceding non-blank characters), and
    inserts a tabulator stop otherwise.  `M-TAB' always inserts a tabulator
    stop.


  COMMENTS:
        `--'       puts a single comment.
        `---'      draws a horizontal line for separating code segments.
        `----'     inserts a display comment, i.e. two horizontal lines
                   with a comment in between.
        `--CR'     comments out code on that line.  Re-hitting CR comments
                   out following lines.
        `C-c C-c'  comments out a region if not commented out,
                   uncomments a region if already commented out.  Option
                   `comment-style' defines where the comment characters
                   should be placed (beginning of line, indent, etc.).

      You are prompted for comments after object definitions (i.e. signals,
    variables, constants, ports) and after subprogram and process
    specifications if option `vhdl-prompt-for-comments' is non-nil.
    Comments are automatically inserted as additional labels (e.g. after
    begin statements) and as help comments if `vhdl-self-insert-comments' is
    non-nil.

      Inline comments (i.e. comments after a piece of code on the same line)
    are indented at least to `vhdl-inline-comment-column'.  Comments go at
    maximum to `vhdl-end-comment-column'.  `RET' after a space in a comment
    will open a new comment line.  Typing beyond `vhdl-end-comment-column'
    in a comment automatically opens a new comment line.  `M-q' re-fills
    multi-line comments.


  INDENTATION:
    `TAB' indents a line if at the beginning of the line.  The amount of
    indentation is specified by option `vhdl-basic-offset'.  `C-c C-i C-l'
    always indents the current line (is bound to `TAB' if option
    `vhdl-intelligent-tab' is nil).  If a region is active, `TAB' indents
    the entire region.

      Indentation can be done for a group of lines (`C-c C-i C-g'), a region
    (`M-C-\\') or the entire buffer (menu).  Argument and port lists are
    indented normally (nil) or relative to the opening parenthesis (non-nil)
    according to option `vhdl-argument-list-indent'.

      If option `vhdl-indent-tabs-mode' is nil, spaces are used instead of
    tabs.  \\[tabify] and \\[untabify] allow the conversion of spaces to
    tabs and vice versa.

      Syntax-based indentation can be very slow in large files.  Option
    `vhdl-indent-syntax-based' allows you to use faster but simpler indentation.

      Option `vhdl-indent-comment-like-next-code-line' controls whether
    comment lines are indented like the preceding or like the following code
    line.


  ALIGNMENT:
    The alignment functions align operators, keywords, and inline comments
    to beautify the code.  `C-c C-a C-a' aligns a group of consecutive lines
    separated by blank lines, `C-c C-a C-i' a block of lines with same
    indent.  `C-c C-a C-l' aligns all lines belonging to a list enclosed by
    a pair of parentheses (e.g. port clause/map, argument list), and `C-c
    C-a C-d' all lines within the declarative part of a design unit.  `C-c
    C-a M-a' aligns an entire region.  `C-c C-a C-c' aligns inline comments
    for a group of lines, and `C-c C-a M-c' for a region.

      If option `vhdl-align-groups' is non-nil, groups of code lines
    separated by special lines (see option `vhdl-align-group-separate') are
    aligned individually.  If option `vhdl-align-same-indent' is non-nil,
    blocks of lines with same indent are aligned separately.  Some templates
    are automatically aligned after generation if option `vhdl-auto-align'
    is non-nil.

      Alignment tries to align inline comments at
    `vhdl-inline-comment-column' and tries inline comment not to exceed
    `vhdl-end-comment-column'.

      `C-c C-x M-w' fixes up whitespace in a region.  That is, operator
    symbols are surrounded by one space, and multiple spaces are eliminated.


  CODE FILLING:
    Code filling allows you to condense code (e.g. sensitivity lists or port
    maps) by removing comments and newlines and re-wrapping so that all
    lines are maximally filled (block filling).  `C-c C-f C-f' fills a list
    enclosed by parenthesis, `C-c C-f C-g' a group of lines separated by
    blank lines, `C-c C-f C-i' a block of lines with same indent, and
    `C-c C-f M-f' an entire region.


  CODE BEAUTIFICATION:
    `C-c M-b' and `C-c C-b' beautify the code of a region or of the entire
    buffer respectively.  This includes indentation, alignment, and case
    fixing.  Code beautification can also be run non-interactively using the
    command:

      emacs -batch -l ~/.emacs filename.vhd -f vhdl-beautify-buffer


  PORT TRANSLATION:
    Generic and port clauses from entity or component declarations can be
    copied (`C-c C-p C-w') and pasted as entity and component declarations,
    as component instantiations and corresponding internal constants and
    signals, as a generic map with constants as actual generics, and as
    internal signal initializations (menu).

      To include formals in component instantiations, see option
    `vhdl-association-list-with-formals'.  To include comments in pasting,
    see options `vhdl-include-...-comments'.

      A clause with several generic/port names on the same line can be
    flattened (`C-c C-p C-f') so that only one name per line exists.  The
    direction of ports can be reversed (`C-c C-p C-r'), i.e., inputs become
    outputs and vice versa, which can be useful in testbenches.  (This
    reversion is done on the internal data structure and is only reflected
    in subsequent paste operations.)

      Names for actual ports, instances, testbenches, and
    design-under-test instances can be derived from existing names according
    to options `vhdl-...-name'.  See customization group `vhdl-port'.


  SUBPROGRAM TRANSLATION:
    Similar functionality exists for copying/pasting the interface of
    subprograms (function/procedure).  A subprogram interface can be copied
    and then pasted as a subprogram declaration, body or call (uses
    association list with formals).


  TESTBENCH GENERATION:
    A copied port can also be pasted as a testbench.  The generated
    testbench includes an entity, an architecture, and an optional
    configuration.  The architecture contains the component declaration and
    instantiation of the DUT as well as internal constant and signal
    declarations.  Additional user-defined templates can be inserted.  The
    names used for entity/architecture/configuration/DUT as well as the file
    structure to be generated can be customized. See customization group
   `vhdl-testbench'.


  KEY BINDINGS:
    Key bindings (`C-c ...') exist for most commands (see in menu).


  VHDL MENU:
    All commands can be found in the VHDL menu including their key bindings.


  FILE BROWSER:
    The speedbar allows browsing of directories and file contents.  It can
    be accessed from the VHDL menu and is automatically opened if option
    `vhdl-speedbar-auto-open' is non-nil.

      In speedbar, open files and directories with `mouse-2' on the name and
    browse/rescan their contents with `mouse-2'/`S-mouse-2' on the `+'.


  DESIGN HIERARCHY BROWSER:
    The speedbar can also be used for browsing the hierarchy of design units
    contained in the source files of the current directory or the specified
    projects (see option `vhdl-project-alist').

      The speedbar can be switched between file, directory hierarchy and
    project hierarchy browsing mode in the speedbar menu or by typing `f',
    `h' or `H' in speedbar.

      In speedbar, open design units with `mouse-2' on the name and browse
    their hierarchy with `mouse-2' on the `+'.  Ports can directly be copied
    from entities and components (in packages).  Individual design units and
    complete designs can directly be compiled (\"Make\" menu entry).

      The hierarchy is automatically updated upon saving a modified source
    file when option `vhdl-speedbar-update-on-saving' is non-nil.  The
    hierarchy is only updated for projects that have been opened once in the
    speedbar.  The hierarchy is cached between Emacs sessions in a file (see
    options in group `vhdl-speedbar').

      Simple design consistency checks are done during scanning, such as
    multiple declarations of the same unit or missing primary units that are
    required by secondary units.


  STRUCTURAL COMPOSITION:
    Enables simple structural composition.  `C-c C-m C-n' creates a skeleton
    for a new component.  Subcomponents (i.e. component declaration and
    instantiation) can be automatically placed from a previously read port
    (`C-c C-m C-p') or directly from the hierarchy browser (`P').  Finally,
    all subcomponents can be automatically connected using internal signals
    and ports (`C-c C-m C-w') following these rules:
      - subcomponent actual ports with same name are considered to be
        connected by a signal (internal signal or port)
      - signals that are only inputs to subcomponents are considered as
        inputs to this component -> input port created
      - signals that are only outputs from subcomponents are considered as
        outputs from this component -> output port created
      - signals that are inputs to AND outputs from subcomponents are
        considered as internal connections -> internal signal created

      Purpose:  With appropriate naming conventions it is possible to
    create higher design levels with only a few mouse clicks or key
    strokes.  A new design level can be created by simply generating a new
    component, placing the required subcomponents from the hierarchy
    browser, and wiring everything automatically.

      Note: Automatic wiring only works reliably on templates of new
    components and component instantiations that were created by VHDL mode.

      Component declarations can be placed in a components package (option
    `vhdl-use-components-package') which can be automatically generated for
    an entire directory or project (`C-c C-m M-p').  The VHDL'93 direct
    component instantiation is also supported (option
    `vhdl-use-direct-instantiation').

      Configuration declarations can automatically be generated either from
    the menu (`C-c C-m C-f') (for the architecture the cursor is in) or from
    the speedbar menu (for the architecture under the cursor).  The
    configurations can optionally be hierarchical (i.e. include all
    component levels of a hierarchical design, option
    `vhdl-compose-configuration-hierarchical') or include subconfigurations
    (option `vhdl-compose-configuration-use-subconfiguration').  For
    subcomponents in hierarchical configurations, the most-recently-analyzed
    (mra) architecture is selected.  If another architecture is desired, it
    can be marked as most-recently-analyzed (speedbar menu) before
    generating the configuration.

      Note: Configurations of subcomponents (i.e. hierarchical configuration
    declarations) are currently not considered when displaying
    configurations in speedbar.

      See the options group `vhdl-compose' for all relevant user options.


  SOURCE FILE COMPILATION:
    The syntax of the current buffer can be analyzed by calling a VHDL
    compiler (menu, `C-c C-k').  The compiler to be used is specified by
    option `vhdl-compiler'.  The available compilers are listed in option
    `vhdl-compiler-alist' including all required compilation command,
    command options, compilation directory, and error message syntax
    information.  New compilers can be added.

      All the source files of an entire design can be compiled by the `make'
    command (menu, `C-c M-C-k') if an appropriate Makefile exists.


  MAKEFILE GENERATION:
    Makefiles can be generated automatically by an internal generation
    routine (`C-c M-k').  The library unit dependency information is
    obtained from the hierarchy browser.  Makefile generation can be
    customized for each compiler in option `vhdl-compiler-alist'.

      Makefile generation can also be run non-interactively using the
    command:

        emacs -batch -l ~/.emacs -l vhdl-mode
              [-compiler compilername] [-project projectname]
              -f vhdl-generate-makefile

      The Makefile's default target \"all\" compiles the entire design, the
    target \"clean\" removes it and the target \"library\" creates the
    library directory if not existent.  These target names can be customized
    by option `vhdl-makefile-default-targets'.  The Makefile also includes a
    target for each primary library unit which allows selective compilation
    of this unit, its secondary units and its subhierarchy (example:
    compilation of a design specified by a configuration).  User specific
    parts can be inserted into a Makefile with option
    `vhdl-makefile-generation-hook'.

    Limitations:
      - Only library units and dependencies within the current library are
        considered.  Makefiles for designs that span multiple libraries are
        not (yet) supported.
      - Only one-level configurations are supported (also hierarchical),
        but configurations that go down several levels are not.
      - The \"others\" keyword in configurations is not supported.


  PROJECTS:
    Projects can be defined in option `vhdl-project-alist' and a current
    project be selected using option `vhdl-project' (permanently) or from
    the menu or speedbar (temporarily).  For each project, title and
    description strings (for the file headers), source files/directories
    (for the hierarchy browser and Makefile generation), library name, and
    compiler-dependent options, exceptions and compilation directory can be
    specified.  Compilation settings overwrite the settings of option
    `vhdl-compiler-alist'.

      Project setups can be exported (i.e. written to a file) and imported.
    Imported setups are not automatically saved in `vhdl-project-alist' but
    can be saved afterwards in its customization buffer.  When starting
    Emacs with VHDL Mode (i.e. load a VHDL file or use \"emacs -l
    vhdl-mode\") in a directory with an existing project setup file, it is
    automatically loaded and its project activated if option
    `vhdl-project-autoload' is non-nil.  Names/paths of the project setup
    files can be specified in option `vhdl-project-file-name'.  Multiple
    project setups can be automatically loaded from global directories.
    This is an alternative to specifying project setups with option
    `vhdl-project-alist'.


  SPECIAL MENUS:
    As an alternative to the speedbar, an index menu can be added (set
    option `vhdl-index-menu' to non-nil) or made accessible as a mouse menu
    (e.g. add \"(global-set-key [S-down-mouse-3] \\='imenu)\" to your start-up
    file) for browsing the file contents (is not populated if buffer is
    larger than 256000).  Also, a source file menu can be
    added (set option `vhdl-source-file-menu' to non-nil) for browsing the
    current directory for VHDL source files.


  VHDL STANDARDS:
    The VHDL standards to be used are specified in option `vhdl-standard'.
    Available standards are: VHDL'87/'93(02)/'08, VHDL-AMS, and Math Packages.


  KEYWORD CASE:
    Lower and upper case for keywords and standardized types, attributes,
    and enumeration values is supported.  If the option
    `vhdl-upper-case-keywords' is set to non-nil, keywords can be typed in
    lower case and are converted into upper case automatically (not for
    types, attributes, and enumeration values).  The case of keywords,
    types, attributes,and enumeration values can be fixed for an entire
    region (menu) or buffer (`C-c C-x C-c') according to the options
    `vhdl-upper-case-{keywords,types,attributes,enum-values}'.


  HIGHLIGHTING (fontification):
    Keywords and standardized types, attributes, enumeration values, and
    function names (controlled by option `vhdl-highlight-keywords'), as well
    as comments, strings, and template prompts are highlighted using
    different colors.  Unit, subprogram, signal, variable, constant,
    parameter and generic/port names in declarations as well as labels are
    highlighted if option `vhdl-highlight-names' is non-nil.

      Additional reserved words or words with a forbidden syntax (e.g. words
    that should be avoided) can be specified in option
    `vhdl-forbidden-words' or `vhdl-forbidden-syntax' and be highlighted in
    a warning color (option `vhdl-highlight-forbidden-words').  Verilog
    keywords are highlighted as forbidden words if option
    `vhdl-highlight-verilog-keywords' is non-nil.

      Words with special syntax can be highlighted by specifying their
    syntax and color in option `vhdl-special-syntax-alist' and by setting
    option `vhdl-highlight-special-words' to non-nil.  This allows you to
    establish some naming conventions (e.g. to distinguish different kinds
    of signals or other objects by using name suffices) and to support them
    visually.

      Option `vhdl-highlight-case-sensitive' can be set to non-nil in order
    to support case-sensitive highlighting.  However, keywords are then only
    highlighted if written in lower case.

      Code between \"translate_off\" and \"translate_on\" pragmas is
    highlighted using a different background color if option
    `vhdl-highlight-translate-off' is non-nil.

      For documentation and customization of the used colors see
    customization group `vhdl-highlight-faces' (\\[customize-group]).  For
    highlighting of matching parenthesis, see customization group
    `paren-showing'.  Automatic buffer highlighting is turned on/off by
    option `global-font-lock-mode' (`font-lock-auto-fontify' in XEmacs).


  USER MODELS:
    VHDL models (templates) can be specified by the user and made accessible
    in the menu, through key bindings (`C-c C-m ...'), or by keyword
    electrification.  See option `vhdl-model-alist'.


  HIDE/SHOW:
    The code of blocks, processes, subprograms, component declarations and
    instantiations, generic/port clauses, and configuration declarations can
    be hidden using the `Hide/Show' menu or by pressing `S-mouse-2' within
    the code (see customization group `vhdl-menu').  XEmacs: limited
    functionality due to old `hideshow.el' package.


  CODE UPDATING:
    - Sensitivity List: `C-c C-u C-s' updates the sensitivity list of the
      current process, `C-c C-u M-s' of all processes in the current buffer.
      Limitations:
        - Only declared local signals (ports, signals declared in
          architecture and blocks) are automatically inserted.
        - Global signals declared in packages are not automatically inserted.
          Insert them once manually (will be kept afterwards).
        - Out parameters of procedures are considered to be read.
      Use option `vhdl-entity-file-name' to specify the entity file name
      (used to obtain the port names).
      Use option `vhdl-array-index-record-field-in-sensitivity-list' to
      specify whether to include array indices and record fields in
      sensitivity lists.


  CODE FIXING:
    `C-c C-x C-p' fixes the closing parenthesis of a generic/port clause
    (e.g., if the closing parenthesis is on the wrong line or is missing).


  PRINTING:
    PostScript printing with different faces (an optimized set of faces is
    used if `vhdl-print-customize-faces' is non-nil) or colors (if
    `ps-print-color-p' is non-nil) is possible using the standard Emacs
    PostScript printing commands.  Option `vhdl-print-two-column' defines
    appropriate default settings for nice landscape two-column printing.
    The paper format can be set by option `ps-paper-type'.  Do not forget to
    switch `ps-print-color-p' to nil for printing on black-and-white
    printers.


  OPTIONS:
    User options allow customization of VHDL Mode.  All options are
    accessible from the \"Options\" menu entry.  Simple options (switches
    and choices) can directly be changed, while for complex options a
    customization buffer is opened.  Changed options can be saved for future
    sessions using the \"Save Options\" menu entry.

      Options and their detailed descriptions can also be accessed by using
    the \"Customize\" menu entry or the command \\[customize-option]
    (\\[customize-group] for groups).  Some customizations only take effect
    after some action (read the NOTE in the option documentation).
    Customization can also be done globally (i.e. site-wide, read the
    INSTALL file).

      Not all options are described in this documentation, so go and see
    what other useful user options there are (\\[vhdl-customize] or menu)!


  FILE EXTENSIONS:
    As default, files with extensions \".vhd\" and \".vhdl\" are
    automatically recognized as VHDL source files.  To add an extension
    \".xxx\", add the following line to your Emacs start-up file (`.emacs'):

      (push \\='(\"\\\\.xxx\\\\\\='\" . vhdl-mode) auto-mode-alist)


  HINTS:
    - To start Emacs with open VHDL hierarchy browser without having to load
      a VHDL file first, use the command:

        emacs -l vhdl-mode -f speedbar-frame-mode

    - Type `C-g C-g' to interrupt long operations or if Emacs hangs.

    - Some features only work on properly indented code.

H, h, ?	 This message.
Digits	provide prefix arguments.
\\[negative-argument]	negative prefix argument.
\\[beginning-of-buffer]	move to the beginning of buffer.

\\[View-scroll-to-buffer-end]	scroll so that buffer end is at last line of window.
SPC	scroll forward \"page size\" lines.
	  With prefix scroll forward prefix lines.
DEL, S-SPC  scroll backward \"page size\" lines.
	      With prefix scroll backward prefix lines.
\\[View-scroll-page-forward-set-page-size]	like  \\[View-scroll-page-forward]  but with prefix sets \"page size\" to prefix.
\\[View-scroll-page-backward-set-page-size]	like  \\[View-scroll-page-backward]  but with prefix sets \"page size\" to prefix.
\\[View-scroll-half-page-forward]	scroll forward \"half page size\" lines.  With prefix, sets
	  \"half page size\" to prefix lines and scrolls forward that much.
\\[View-scroll-half-page-backward]	scroll backward \"half page size\" lines.  With prefix, sets
	  \"half page size\" to prefix lines and scrolls backward that much.
RET, LFD  scroll forward one line.  With prefix scroll forward prefix line(s).

	  ! and @ have a special meaning at the beginning of the regexp.
	  ! means search for a line with no match for regexp.  @ means start

\\[View-leave]	quit View mode and maybe switch buffers, but don't kill this buffer.
\\[View-kill-and-leave]	quit View mode, kill current buffer and go back to other buffer.

The effect of \\[View-leave], \\[View-quit] and \\[View-kill-and-leave] depends on how view-mode was entered.  If it was
entered by view-file, view-file-other-window, view-file-other-frame, or
\\[dired-view-file] (\\[view-file], \\[view-file-other-window],
\\[view-file-other-frame], or the Dired mode v command),

If view-mode was entered from another buffer, by \\[view-buffer],
\\[view-buffer-other-window], \\[view-buffer-other frame], \\[view-file],
\\[view-file-other-window], or \\[view-file-other-frame],
then \\[View-leave], \\[View-quit] and \\[View-kill-and-leave] will return to that buffer.

Toggle XTerm mouse mode.

Turn it on to use Emacs mouse commands, and off to use xterm mouse
commands.  This works in terminal emulators compatible with xterm.  When
turned on, the normal xterm mouse functionality for such clicks is still
available by holding down the SHIFT key while pressing the mouse button.

On text terminals that Emacs knows are compatible with the mouse as well
as other critical editing functionality, this is automatically turned on
at startup.  See Info node `(elisp)Terminal-Specific' and `xterm--init'.

This is a global minor mode.  If called interactively, toggle the
`Xterm-Mouse mode' mode.  If the prefix argument is positive, enable the
mode, and if it is zero or negative, disable the mode.

If called from Lisp, toggle the mode if ARG is `toggle'.  Enable the
mode if ARG is nil, omitted, or is a positive number.  Disable the mode
if ARG is a negative number.

To check whether the minor mode is enabled in the current buffer,
evaluate `(default-value \\='xterm-mouse-mode)'.

The mode's hook is called both when the mode is enabled and when it is
disabled.
