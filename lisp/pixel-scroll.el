;; Usage:
;;
;; To interactively toggle the mode:
;;
;;   M-x pixel-scroll-mode RET
;;
;; To make the mode permanent, put these in your init file:
;;
;;   (require 'pixel-scroll)
;;   (pixel-scroll-mode 1)

;;; Commentary:

;; This package offers a global minor mode which makes mouse-wheel
;; scroll a line smoothly.
;;
;; Scrolling a line up by `set-window-vscroll' and that by `scroll-up'
;; give similar display as shown below.
;;
;;  A: (scroll-up 1)
;;  B: (set-window-vscroll nil (frame-char-height) t)
;;
;; Also scrolling a pixel up by `set-window-vscroll' and that by
;; `scroll-up' give similar display, when vscroll is the last pixel of
;; the line, as shown below.
;;
;;  A: (scroll-up 1)
;;  B: (set-window-vscroll nil (1- (frame-char-height) t)) (scroll-up 1)
;;
;; When point reaches to the top of a window on scroll by
;; `set-window-vscroll', vscroll is set to zero.  To scroll a line
;; smoothly and continuously, this package scrolls a line by following
;; sequences.
;;
;;  (vertical-motion 1)
;;  (dolist (vs (number-sequence 1 (1- (frame-char-height))))
;;    (set-window-vscroll nil vs t) (sit-for 0))
;;  (scroll-up 1)

;;; Todo:
;;
;; Allowing pixel-level scrolling in Emacs requires a thorough review
;; of the related functionalities, to make sure none of them zeroes
;; out vscroll where users won't want that.
