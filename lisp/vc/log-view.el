;; Major mode to browse revision log histories.
;; Currently supports the format output by:
;; SCCS, RCS, CVS, Subversion, DaRCS, and Mercurial.

;; Examples of log output:

;;;; SCCS:

;; branches:  1.34.2;
;; Change release version from 21.4 to 22.1 throughout.
;; Change development version from 21.3.50 to 22.0.50.

;;;; Darcs:

;; Changes to darcsum.el:
;;
;; Mon Nov 28 15:19:38 GMT 2005  Dave Love <fx@gnu.org>
;;   * Abstract process startup into darcsum-start-process.  Use TERM=dumb.
;;   TERM=dumb avoids escape characters, at least, for any old darcs that
;;   doesn't understand DARCS_DONT_COLOR & al.
;;
;; Thu Nov 24 15:20:45 GMT 2005  Dave Love <fx@gnu.org>
;;   * darcsum-mode-related changes.
;;   Don't call font-lock-mode (unnecessary) or use-local-map (redundant).
;;   Use mode-class 'special.  Add :group.
;;   Add trailing-whitespace option to mode hook and fix
;;   darcsum-display-changeset not to use trailing whitespace.

;;; Todo:

;; - add ability to modify a log-entry (via cvs-mode-admin ;-)
;; - remove references to cvs-*
;; - make it easier to add support for new backends without changing the code.
