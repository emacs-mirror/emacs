;; quotes, e.g., "I'm a string" and 'I too am a string'.
;; In addition a string can have either a 'r' and/or 'u' prefix.
;; The 'r' prefix means raw, i.e., normal backslash substitutions are
;; to be suppressed.  For example, r"01\n34" is a string with six
;; characters 0, 1, \, n, 3 and 4.  The 'u' prefix means the following
