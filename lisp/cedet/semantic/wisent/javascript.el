  "Return protection information about TAG with optional PARENT.
This function returns on of the following symbols:
   nil         - No special protection.  Language dependent.
   `public'    - Anyone can access this TAG.
   `private'   - Only methods in the local scope can access TAG.
   `protected' - Like private for outside scopes, like public for child
                 classes.
Some languages may choose to provide additional return symbols specific
to themselves.  Use of this function should allow for this.

The default behavior (if not overridden with `tag-protection'
is to return a symbol based on type modifiers."

  "Calculate the access class for TYPE as defined by the current SCOPE.
Access is related to the :parents in SCOPE.  If type is a member of SCOPE
then access would be 'private.  If TYPE is inherited by a member of SCOPE,
the access would be 'protected.  Otherwise, access is 'public."

(define-mode-local-override semantic-ctxt-current-symbol javascript-mode (&optional point)
  "Return the current symbol the cursor is on at POINT in a list.
This is a very simple implementation for Javascript symbols.  It
will at maximum do one split, so that the first part is seen as
one type.  For example:  $('#sel').foo.bar will return (\"$('sel').foo\" \"bar\").
This is currently needed for the mozrepl omniscient database."
