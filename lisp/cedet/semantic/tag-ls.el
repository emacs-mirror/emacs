;;; Commentary:
;;
;; There are some features of tags that are too language dependent to
;; put in the core `semantic-tag' functionality.  For instance, the
;; protection of a tag (as specified by UML) could be almost anything.
;; In Java, it is a type specifier.  In C, there is a label.  This
;; information can be derived, and thus should not be stored in the tag
;; itself.  These are the functions that languages can use to derive
;; the information.

;;; TAG SIMILARITY:

;; Two tags that represent the same thing are "similar", but not the "same".
;; Similar tags might have the same name, but one is a :prototype, while
;; the other is an implementation.
;;
;; Each language will have different things that can be ignored
;; between two "similar" tags, so similarity checks involve a series
;; of mode overridable features.  Some are "internal" features.
