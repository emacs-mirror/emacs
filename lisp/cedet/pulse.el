;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Manage temporary pulsing of faces and overlays.
;;
;; This is a temporal decoration technique where something is to be
;; highlighted briefly.  This adds a gentle pulsing style to the text
;; decorated this way.
;;
;; The following are useful entry points:
;;
;; `pulse-tick' - Cause `pulse-highlight-face' to shift toward background color.
;;      Assumes you are using a version of Emacs that supports pulsing.
;;
;; `pulse-momentary-highlight-one-line' - Pulse a single line at POINT.
;; `pulse-momentary-highlight-region' - Pulse a region.
;; `pulse-momentary-highlight-overlay' - Pulse an overlay.
;;      These three functions will just blink the specified area if
;;      the version of Emacs you are using doesn't support pulsing.
;;
;; `pulse-line-hook-function' - A simple function that can be used in a
;;      hook that will pulse whatever line the cursor is on.
;;
;;; History:
;;
;; The original pulse code was written for semantic tag highlighting.
;; It has been extracted, and adapted for general purpose pulsing.
;;
;; Pulse is a part of CEDET.  https://cedet.sourceforge.net

Pulsing involves a bright highlight that slowly shifts to the
background color.

If the value is nil, highlight with an unchanging color until a

If the value is `never', do no coloring at all.
Any other value means to do the default pulsing behavior.
