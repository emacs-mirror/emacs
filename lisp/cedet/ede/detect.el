;; Project detection for EDE;
;;
;; Detection comes in multiple forms:
;;
;; `ede-detect-scan-directory-for-project' -
;;        Scan for a project via the file system.
;; `ede-detect-directory-for-project' -
;;        Check our file cache for a project.  If that fails, use
;;        the scan fcn above.
