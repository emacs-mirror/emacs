;;; Commentary:

;; This file provides a set of operations to save a frameset (the state
;; of all or a subset of the existing frames and windows), both
;; in-session and persistently, and restore it at some point in the
;; future.
;;
;; It should be noted that restoring the frames' windows depends on
;; the buffers they are displaying, but this package does not provide
;; any way to save and restore sets of buffers (see desktop.el for
;; that).  So, it's up to the user of frameset.el to make sure that
;; any relevant buffer is loaded before trying to restore a frameset.
;; When a window is restored and a buffer is missing, the window will
;; be deleted unless it is the last one in the frame, in which case
;; some previous buffer will be shown instead.

  "A frameset encapsulates a serializable view of a set of frames and windows.

It contains the following slots, which can be accessed with
\(frameset-SLOT fs) and set with (setf (frameset-SLOT fs) VALUE):

  version      A read-only version number, identifying the format
		 of the frameset struct.  Currently its value is 1.
  timestamp    A read-only timestamp, the output of `current-time'.
  app          A symbol, or a list whose first element is a symbol, which
		 identifies the creator of the frameset and related info;
		 for example, desktop.el sets this slot to a list
		 `(desktop . ,desktop-file-version).
  name         A string, the name of the frameset instance.
  description  A string, a description for user consumption (to show in
		 menus, messages, etc).
  properties   A property list, to store both frameset-specific and
		 user-defined serializable data.
  states       A list of items (FRAME-PARAMETERS . WINDOW-STATE), in no
		 particular order.  Each item represents a frame to be
		 restored.  FRAME-PARAMETERS is a frame's parameter alist,
		 extracted with (frame-parameters FRAME) and filtered
		 through `frameset-filter-params'.
		 WINDOW-STATE is the output of `window-state-get' applied
		 to the root window of the frame.

To avoid collisions, it is recommended that applications wanting to add
private serializable data to `properties' either store all info under a
single, distinctive name, or use property names with a well-chosen prefix.

A frameset is intended to be used through the following simple API:

 - `frameset-save', the type's constructor, captures all or a subset of the
   live frames, and returns a serializable snapshot of them (a frameset).
 - `frameset-restore' takes a frameset, and restores the frames and windows
   it describes, as faithfully as possible.
 - `frameset-p' is the predicate for the frameset type.
 - `frameset-valid-p' checks a frameset's validity.
 - `frameset-copy' returns a deep copy of a frameset.
 - `frameset-prop' is a `setf'able accessor for the contents of the
   `properties' slot.
 - The `frameset-SLOT' accessors described above."

;; Filtering

;; What's the deal with these "filter alists"?
;;
;; Let's say that Emacs' frame parameters were never designed as a tool to
;; precisely record (or restore) a frame's state.  They grew organically,
;; and their uses and behaviors reflect their history.  In using them to
;; implement framesets, the unwary implementer, or the prospective package
;; writer willing to use framesets in their code, might fall victim of some
;; unexpected... oddities.
;;
;; You can find frame parameters that:
;;
;; - can be used to get and set some data from the frame's current state
;;   (`height', `width')
;; - can be set at creation time, and setting them afterwards has no effect
;;   (`window-state', `minibuffer')
;; - can be set at creation time, and setting them afterwards will fail with
;;   an error, *unless* you set it to the same value, a noop (`border-width')
;; - act differently when passed at frame creation time, and when set
;;   afterwards (`height')
;; - affect the value of other parameters (`name', `visibility')
;; - can be ignored by window managers (most positional args, like `height',
;;   `width', `left' and `top', and others, like `auto-raise', `auto-lower')
;; - can be set externally in X resources or Window registry (again, most
;;   positional parameters, and also `toolbar-lines', `menu-bar-lines' etc.)
;, - can contain references to live objects (`buffer-list', `minibuffer') or
;;   code (`buffer-predicate')
;; - are set automatically, and cannot be changed (`window-id', `parent-id'),
;;   but setting them produces no error
;; - have a noticeable effect in some window managers, and are ignored in
;;   others (`menu-bar-lines')
;; - can not be safely set in a tty session and then copied back to a GUI
;;   session (`font', `background-color', `foreground-color')
;;
;; etc etc.
;;
;; Which means that, in order to save a parameter alist to disk and read it
;; back later to reconstruct a frame, some processing must be done.  That's
;; what `frameset-filter-params' and the `frameset-*-filter-alist' variables
;; are for.
;;
;; First, a clarification.  The word "filter" in these names refers to both
;; common meanings of filter: to filter out (i.e., to remove), and to pass
;; through a transformation function (think `filter-buffer-substring').
;;
;; `frameset-filter-params' takes a parameter alist PARAMETERS, a filtering
;; alist FILTER-ALIST, and a flag SAVING to indicate whether we are filtering
;; parameters with the intent of saving a frame or restoring it.  It then
;; accumulates an output alist, FILTERED, by checking each parameter in
;; PARAMETERS against FILTER-ALIST and obeying any rule found there.  The
;; absence of a rule just means the parameter/value pair (called CURRENT in
;; filtering functions) is copied to FILTERED as is.  Keyword values :save,
;; :restore and :never tell the function to copy CURRENT to FILTERED in the
;; respective situations, that is, when saving, restoring, or never at all.
;; Values :save and :restore can be useful, for example, if you already
;; have a saved frameset created with some intent, and want to reuse it for
;; a different objective where the expected parameter list has different
;; requirements.
;;
;; Finally, the value can also be a filtering function, or a filtering
;; function plus some arguments.  The function is called for each matching
;; parameter, and receives CURRENT (the parameter/value pair being processed),
;; FILTERED (the output alist so far), PARAMETERS (the full parameter alist),
;; SAVING (the save/restore flag), plus any additional ARGS set along the
;; function in the `frameset-*-filter-alist' entry.  The filtering function
;; then has the possibility to pass along CURRENT, or reject it altogether,
;; or pass back a (NEW-PARAM . NEW-VALUE) pair, which does not even need to
;; refer to the same parameter (so you can filter `width' and return `height'
;; and vice versa, if you're feeling silly and want to mess with the user's
;; mind).  As a help in deciding what to do, the filtering function has
;; access to PARAMETERS, but must not change it in any way.  It also has
;; access to FILTERED, which can be modified at will.  This allows two or
;; more filters to coordinate themselves, because in general there's no way
;; to predict the order in which they will be run.
;;
;; So, which parameters are filtered by default, and why? Let's see.
;;
;; - `buffer-list', `buried-buffer-list', `buffer-predicate': They contain
;;   references to live objects, or in the case of `buffer-predicate', it
;;   could also contain an fbound symbol (a predicate function) that could
;;   not be defined in a later session.
;;
;; - `window-id', `outer-window-id', `parent-id': They are assigned
;;   automatically and cannot be set, so keeping them is harmless, but they
;;   add clutter.  `window-system' is similar: it's assigned at frame
;;   creation, and does not serve any useful purpose later.
;;
;; - `left', `top': Only problematic when saving an iconified frame, because
;;   when the frame is iconified they are set to (- 32000), which doesn't
;;   really help in restoring the frame.  Better to remove them and let the
;;   window manager choose a default position for the frame.
;;
;; - `background-color', `foreground-color': In tty frames they can be set
;;   to "unspecified-bg" and "unspecified-fg", which aren't understood on
;;   GUI sessions.  They have to be filtered out when switching from tty to
;;   a graphical display.
;;
;; - `tty', `tty-type': These are tty-specific.  When switching to a GUI
;;   display they do no harm, but they clutter the parameter alist.
;;
;; - `minibuffer': It can contain a reference to a live window, which cannot
;;   be serialized.  Because of Emacs' idiosyncratic treatment of this
;;   parameter, frames created with (minibuffer . t) have a parameter
;;   (minibuffer . #<window...>), while frames created with
;;   (minibuffer . #<window...>) have (minibuffer . nil), which is madness
;;   but helps to differentiate between minibufferless and "normal" frames.
;;   So, changing (minibuffer . #<window...>) to (minibuffer . t) allows
;;   Emacs to set up the new frame correctly.  Nice, uh?
;;
;; - `name': If this parameter is directly set, `explicit-name' is
;;   automatically set to t, and then `name' no longer changes dynamically.
;;   So, in general, not saving `name' is the right thing to do, though
;;   surely there are applications that will want to override this filter.
;;
;; - `frameset--text-pixel-height', `frameset--text-pixel-width': These are used to
;;   save the pixel width and height of a frame. They are necessary
;;   during restore, but should not be set on the actual frame after
;;   restoring, so `:save' is used to ensure they are only saved.
;;
;; - `font', `fullscreen', `height' and `width': These parameters suffer
;;   from the fact that they are badly mangled when going through a
;;   tty session, though not all in the same way.  When saving a GUI frame
;;   and restoring it in a tty, the height and width of the new frame are
;;   those of the tty screen (let's say 80x25, for example); going back
;;   to a GUI session means getting frames of the tty screen size (so all
;;   your frames are 80 cols x 25 rows).  For `fullscreen' there's a
;;   similar problem, because a tty frame cannot really be fullscreen or
;;   maximized, so the state is lost.  The problem with `font' is a bit
;;   different, because a valid GUI font spec in `font' turns into
;;   (font . "tty") in a tty frame, and when read back into a GUI session
;;   it fails because `font's value is no longer a valid font spec.
;;
;; In most cases, the filtering functions just do the obvious thing: remove
;; CURRENT when it is meaningless to keep it, or pass a modified copy if
;; that helps (as in the case of `minibuffer').
;;
;; The exception are the parameters in the last set, which should survive
;; the roundtrip though tty-land.  The answer is to add "stashing
;; parameters", working in pairs, to shelve the GUI-specific contents and
;; restore it once we're back in pixel country.  That's what functions
;; `frameset-filter-shelve-param' and `frameset-filter-unshelve-param' do.
;;
;; Basically, if you set `frameset-filter-shelve-param' as the filter for
;; a parameter P, it will detect when it is restoring a GUI frame into a
;; tty session, and save P's value in the custom parameter X:P, but only
;; if X:P does not exist already (so it is not overwritten if you enter
;; the tty session more than once).  If you're not switching to a tty
;; frame, the filter just passes CURRENT along.
;;
;; The parameter X:P, on the other hand, must have been setup to be
;; filtered by `frameset-filter-unshelve-param', which unshelves the
;; value: if we're entering a GUI session, returns P instead of CURRENT,
;; while in other cases it just passes it along.
;;
;; The only additional trick is that `frameset-filter-shelve-param' does
;; not set P if switching back to GUI and P already has a value, because
;; it assumes that `frameset-filter-unshelve-param' did set it up.  And
;; `frameset-filter-unshelve-param', when unshelving P, must look into
;; FILTERED to determine if P has already been set and if so, modify it;
;; else just returns P.
;;
;; Currently, the value of X in X:P is `GUI', but you can use any prefix,
;; by passing its symbol as argument in the filter:
;;
;;   (my-parameter frameset-filter-shelve-param MYPREFIX)
;;
;; instead of
;;
;;   (my-parameter . frameset-filter-shelve-param)
;;
;; Note that `frameset-filter-unshelve-param' does not need MYPREFIX
;; because it is available from the parameter name in CURRENT.  Also note
;; that the colon between the prefix and the parameter name is hardcoded.
;; The reason is that X:P is quite readable, and that the colon is a
;; very unusual character in symbol names, other than in initial position
;; in keywords (emacs -Q has only two such symbols, and one of them is a
;; URL).  So the probability of a collision with existing or future
;; symbols is quite insignificant.
;;
;; Now, what about the filter alist variables? There are three of them,
;; though only two sets of parameters:
;;
;; - `frameset-session-filter-alist' contains these filters that allow
;;   saving and restoring framesets in-session, without the need to
;;   serialize the frameset or save it to disk (for example, to save a
;;   frameset in a register and restore it later).  Filters in this
;;   list do not remove live objects, except in `minibuffer', which is
;;   dealt especially by `frameset-save' / `frameset-restore'.
;;
;; - `frameset-persistent-filter-alist' is the whole deal.  It does all
;;   the filtering described above, and the result is ready to be saved on
;;   disk without loss of information.  That's the format used by the
;;   desktop.el package, for example.
;;
;; IMPORTANT: These variables share structure and should NEVER be modified.
;;
;; - `frameset-filter-alist': The value of this variable is the default
;;   value for the FILTERS arguments of `frameset-save' and
;;   `frameset-restore'.  It is set to `frameset-persistent-filter-alist',
;;   though it can be changed by specific applications.
;;
;; How to use them?
;;
;; The simplest way is just do nothing.  The default should work
;; reasonably and sensibly enough.  But, what if you really need a
;; customized filter alist?  Then you can create your own variable
;;
;;   (defvar my-filter-alist
;;     '((my-param1 . :never)
;;       (my-param2 . :save)
;;       (my-param3 . :restore)
;;       (my-param4 . my-filtering-function-without-args)
;;       (my-param5   my-filtering-function-with arg1 arg2)
;;       ;;; many other parameters
;;       )
;;     "My customized parameter filter alist.")
;;
;; or, if you're only changing a few items,
;;
;;   (defvar my-filter-alist
;;     (nconc '((my-param1 . :never)
;;              (my-param2 . my-filtering-function))
;;            frameset-filter-alist)
;;     "My brief customized parameter filter alist.")
;;
;; and pass it to the FILTER arg of the save/restore functions,
;; ALWAYS taking care of not modifying the original lists; if you're
;; going to do any modifying of my-filter-alist, please use
;;
;;   (nconc '((my-param1 . :never) ...)
;;          (copy-sequence frameset-filter-alist))
;;
;; One thing you shouldn't forget is that they are alists, so searching
;; in them is sequential.  If you just want to change the default of
;; `name' to allow it to be saved, you can set (name . nil) in your
;; customized filter alist; it will take precedence over the latter
;; setting.  In case you decide that you *always* want to save `name',
;; you can add it to `frameset-filter-alist':
;;
;;   (push '(name . nil) frameset-filter-alist)
;;
;; In certain applications, having a parameter filtering function like
;; `frameset-filter-params' can be useful, even if you're not using
;; framesets.  The interface of `frameset-filter-params' is generic
;; and does not depend of global state, with one exception: it uses
;; the dynamically bound variable `frameset--target-display' to decide
;; if, and how, to modify the `display' parameter of FILTERED.  That
;; should not represent a problem, because it's only meaningful when
;; restoring, and customized uses of `frameset-filter-params' are
;; likely to use their own filter alist and just call
;;
;;   (setq my-filtered (frameset-filter-params my-params my-filters t))
;;
;; In case you want to use it with the standard filters, you can
;; wrap the call to `frameset-filter-params' in a let form to bind
;; `frameset--target-display' to nil or the desired value.

  "Alist of frame parameters and filtering functions.

This alist is the default value of the FILTERS argument of
`frameset-save' and `frameset-restore' (which see).

Initially, `frameset-filter-alist' is set to, and shares the value of,
`frameset-persistent-filter-alist'.  You can override any item in
this alist by `push'ing a new item onto it.  If, for some reason, you
intend to modify existing values, do

  (setq frameset-filter-alist (copy-tree frameset-filter-alist))

before changing anything.

On saving, PARAMETERS is the parameter alist of each frame processed,
and FILTERED is the parameter alist that gets saved to the frameset.

On restoring, PARAMETERS is the parameter alist extracted from the
frameset, and FILTERED is the resulting frame parameter alist used
to restore the frame.

Elements of `frameset-filter-alist' are conses (PARAM . ACTION),
where PARAM is a parameter name (a symbol identifying a frame
parameter), and ACTION can be:

 nil       The parameter is copied to FILTERED.
 :never    The parameter is never copied to FILTERED.
 :save     The parameter is copied only when saving the frame.
 :restore  The parameter is copied only when restoring the frame.
 FILTER    A filter function.

FILTER can be a symbol FILTER-FUN, or a list (FILTER-FUN ARGS...).
FILTER-FUN is invoked with

  (apply FILTER-FUN CURRENT FILTERED PARAMETERS SAVING ARGS)

where

 CURRENT     A cons (PARAM . VALUE), where PARAM is the one being
	     filtered and VALUE is its current value.
 FILTERED    The resulting alist (so far).
 PARAMETERS  The complete alist of parameters being filtered,
 SAVING      Non-nil if filtering before saving state, nil if filtering
	       before restoring it.
 ARGS        Any additional arguments specified in the ACTION.

  "Restore a FRAMESET into the current display(s).

PREDICATE is a function called with two arguments, the parameter alist
and the window-state of the frame being restored, in that order (see
the docstring of the `frameset' defstruct for additional details).
If PREDICATE returns nil, the frame described by that parameter alist
and window-state is not restored.

FILTERS is an alist of parameter filters; if nil, the value of
`frameset-filter-alist' is used instead.

REUSE-FRAMES selects the policy to reuse frames when restoring:
  t        All existing frames can be reused.
  nil      No existing frame can be reused.
  match    Only frames with matching frame ids can be reused.
  PRED     A predicate function; it receives as argument a live frame,
             and must return non-nil to allow reusing it, nil otherwise.

FORCE-DISPLAY can be:
  t        Frames are restored in the current display.
  nil      Frames are restored, if possible, in their original displays.
  delete   Frames in other displays are deleted instead of restored.
  PRED     A function called with two arguments, the parameter alist and
	     the window state (in that order).  It must return t, nil or
	     `delete', as above but affecting only the frame that will
	     be created from that parameter alist.

FORCE-ONSCREEN can be:
  t        Force onscreen only those frames that are fully offscreen.
  nil      Do not force any frame back onscreen.
  all      Force onscreen any frame fully or partially offscreen.
  PRED     A function called with three arguments,
	   - the live frame just restored,
	   - a list (LEFT TOP WIDTH HEIGHT), describing the frame,
	   - a list (LEFT TOP WIDTH HEIGHT), describing the workarea.
	   It must return non-nil to force the frame onscreen, nil otherwise.

CLEANUP-FRAMES allows \"cleaning up\" the frame list after restoring a frameset:
  t        Delete all frames that were not created or restored upon.
  nil      Keep all frames.
  FUNC     A function called with two arguments:
           - FRAME, a live frame.
           - ACTION, which can be one of
             :rejected  Frame existed, but was not a candidate for reuse.
             :ignored   Frame existed, was a candidate, but wasn't reused.
             :reused    Frame existed, was a candidate, and restored upon.
             :created   Frame didn't exist, was created and restored upon.
           Return value is ignored.

Note the timing and scope of the operations described above: REUSE-FRAMES
affects existing frames; PREDICATE, FILTERS and FORCE-DISPLAY affect the frame
being restored before that happens; FORCE-ONSCREEN affects the frame once
it has been restored; and CLEANUP-FRAMES affects all frames alive after the
restoration, including those that have been reused or created anew.

All keyword parameters default to nil."
