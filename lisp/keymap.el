 a string (treated as a keyboard macro),
 a keymap (to define a prefix key),
 a symbol (when the key is looked up, the symbol will stand for its

 a cons (STRING . DEFN), meaning that DEFN is the definition

  "Return non-nil if KEYS, a string, is a valid key sequence.
KEYS should be a string consisting of one or more key strokes,
with a single space character separating one key stroke from another.

Each key stroke is either a single character, or the name of an
event, surrounded by angle brackets <like-this>.  In addition, any
key stroke may be preceded by one or more modifier keys.  Finally,
a limited number of characters have a special shorthand syntax.

Here are some example of valid key sequences.

  \"f\"           (the key `f')
  \"S o m\"       (a three-key sequence of the keys `S', `o' and `m')
  \"C-c o\"       (a two-key sequence: the key `c' with the control modifier

  \"M-RET\"       (the \"return\" key with a meta modifier)
  \"C-M-<space>\" (the \"space\" key with both the control and meta modifiers)

These are the characters that have special shorthand syntax:

keymap(s) will be consulted.

The binding is probably a symbol with a function definition.

Normally, `keymap-lookup' ignores bindings for t, which act as
default bindings, used when nothing else in the keymap applies;
this makes it usable as a general function for probing keymaps.
However, if the optional second argument ACCEPT-DEFAULT is
non-nil, `keymap-lookup' does recognize the default bindings,
just as `read-key-sequence' does.

Like the normal command loop, `keymap-lookup' will remap the
command resulting from looking up KEY by looking up the command
in the current keymaps.  However, if the optional third argument
NO-REMAP is non-nil, `keymap-lookup' returns the unmapped
command.

If KEY is a mouse gesture, the keymaps used depend on the clicked
mouse position with regards to the buffer, and local keymaps, if any,
on display and overlay strings.

If the optional argument POSITION is non-nil, it specifies a mouse
position as returned by `event-start' and `event-end', and the lookup
occurs in the keymaps associated with it instead of KEY.  It can also
be a number or marker, in which case the keymap properties at the

  "Create a new keymap and define KEY/DEFINITION pairs as key bindings.
Return the new keymap.

Options can be given as keywords before the KEY/DEFINITION
pairs.  Available keywords are:

:full      If non-nil, create a chartable alist (see `make-keymap').
             If nil (i.e., the default), create a sparse keymap (see
             `make-sparse-keymap').

:suppress  If non-nil, the keymap will be suppressed (see `suppress-keymap').
             If `nodigits', treat digits like other chars.

:parent    If non-nil, this should be a keymap to use as the parent
             (see `set-keymap-parent').

:keymap    If non-nil, instead of creating a new keymap, the given keymap
             will be destructively modified instead.

:name      If non-nil, this should be a string to use as the menu for
             the keymap in case you use it as a menu with `x-popup-menu'.

:prefix    If non-nil, this should be a symbol to be used as a prefix
             command (see `define-prefix-command').  If this is the case,
             this symbol is returned instead of the map itself.

KEY/DEFINITION pairs are as KEY and DEF in `keymap-set'.  KEY can
also be the special symbol `:menu', in which case DEFINITION
should be a MENU form as accepted by `easy-menu-define'.

(defmacro defvar-keymap (variable-name &rest defs)
  "Define VARIABLE-NAME as a variable with a keymap definition.
See `define-keymap' for an explanation of the keywords and KEY/DEFINITION.

In addition to the keywords accepted by `define-keymap', this
macro also accepts a `:doc' keyword, which (if present) is used
as the variable documentation string.

The `:repeat' keyword can also be specified; it controls the
`repeat-mode' behavior of the bindings in the keymap.  When it is
non-nil, all commands in the map will have the `repeat-map'
symbol property.

More control is available over which commands are repeatable; the
value can also be a property list with properties `:enter' and
`:exit', for example:

     :repeat (:enter (commands ...) :exit (commands ...))

`:enter' specifies the list of additional commands that only
enter `repeat-mode'.  When the list is empty, then by default all
commands in the map enter `repeat-mode'.  This is useful when
there is a command that has the `repeat-map' symbol property, but
doesn't exist in this specific map.  `:exit' is a list of
commands that exit `repeat-mode'.  When the list is empty, no
commands in the map exit `repeat-mode'.  This is useful when a
command exists in this specific map, but it doesn't have the
`repeat-map' symbol property on its symbol.
