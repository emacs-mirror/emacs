;;; Commentary:

;; This uses xmltok.el to do XML parsing. The fundamental problem is
;; how to handle changes. We don't want to maintain a complete parse
;; tree.  We also don't want to reparse from the start of the document
;; on every keystroke.  However, it is not possible in general to
;; parse an XML document correctly starting at a random point in the
;; middle.  The main problems are comments, CDATA sections and
;; processing instructions: these can all contain things that are
;; indistinguishable from elements. Literals in the prolog are also a
;; problem.  Attribute value literals are not a problem because
;; attribute value literals cannot contain less-than signs.
;;
;; Our strategy is to keep track of just the problematic things.
;; Specifically, we keep track of all comments, CDATA sections and
;; processing instructions in the instance.  We do this by marking all
;; except the first character of these with a non-nil nxml-inside text
;; property. The value of the nxml-inside property is comment,
;; cdata-section or processing-instruction.  The first character does
;; not have the nxml-inside property so we can find the beginning of
;; the construct by looking for a change in a text property value
;; (Emacs provides primitives for this).  We use text properties
;; rather than overlays, since the implementation of overlays doesn't
;; look like it scales to large numbers of overlays in a buffer.
;;
;; We don't in fact track all these constructs, but only track them in
;; some initial part of the instance.
;;
;; Thus to parse some random point in the file we first ensure that we
;; have scanned up to that point.  Then we search backwards for a
;; <. Then we check whether the < has an nxml-inside property. If it
;; does we go backwards to first character that does not have an
;; nxml-inside property (this character must be a <).  Then we start
;; parsing forward from the < we have found.
;;
;; The prolog has to be parsed specially, so we also keep track of the
;; end of the prolog in `nxml-prolog-end'. The prolog is reparsed on
;; every change to the prolog.  This won't work well if people try to
;; edit huge internal subsets. Hopefully that will be rare.
;;
;; We keep track of the changes by adding to the buffer's
;; after-change-functions hook.  Scanning is also done as a
;; prerequisite to fontification by adding to fontification-functions
;; (in the same way as jit-lock).  This means that scanning for these
;; constructs had better be quick.  Fortunately it is. Firstly, the
;; typical proportion of comments, CDATA sections and processing
;; instructions is small relative to other things.  Secondly, to scan
;; we just search for the regexp <[!?].
