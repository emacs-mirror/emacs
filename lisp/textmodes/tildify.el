;;; Commentary:

;; This package can be typically used for adding forgotten tildes in TeX
;; sources or adding `&nbsp;' sequences in SGML (e.g. HTML) texts.
;;
;; For example, the Czech orthography requires avoiding one letter
;; prepositions at line endings.  So they should be connected with the
;; following words by a tilde.  Some users forget to do this all the
;; time.  The purpose of this program is to check the text and suggest
;; adding of missing tildes on some places.  It works in a similar
;; manner to `query-replace-regexp'.
;;
;; The functionality of this program is actually performing query
;; replace on certain regions, but for historical reasons explained
;; above it is called `tildify'.
;;
;; The default variable settings are suited for Czech, so do not try to
;; understand them if you are not familiar with Czech grammar and spelling.
;;
;; The algorithm was inspired by Petr Olšák's program `vlna'.  Abilities of
;; `tildify.el' are a little limited; if you have improvement suggestions, let
;; me know.
