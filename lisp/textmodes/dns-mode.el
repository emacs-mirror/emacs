Replace the address by its ip6.arpa-representation for use in
reverse zone files, placing the original address in the kill ring.

The address can be: a complete address (no prefix designator);
with a normal prefix designator (e.g. /48), in which case only
the required number of nibbles are output; or with a negative
prefix designator (e.g. /-112), in which case only the part of
the address *not* covered by the absolute value of the prefix
length is output, as a relative address (without \".ip6.arpa.\" at
the end).  This is useful when $ORIGIN is specified in the zone file.

Optional prefix argument NEGATE-PREFIX negates the value of the
detected prefix length.
