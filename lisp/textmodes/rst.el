;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides major mode rst-mode, which supports documents marked
;; up using the reStructuredText format.  Support includes font locking as well
;; as a lot of convenience functions for editing.  It does this by defining a
;; Emacs major mode: rst-mode (ReST).  This mode is derived from text-mode.
;; This package also contains:
;;
;; - Functions to automatically adjust and cycle the section underline
;;   adornments;
;; - A mode that displays the table of contents and allows you to jump anywhere
;;   from it;
;; - Functions to insert and automatically update a TOC in your source
;;   document;
;; - Function to insert list, processing item bullets and enumerations
;;   automatically;
;; - Font-lock highlighting of most reStructuredText structures;
;; - Indentation and filling according to reStructuredText syntax;
;; - Cursor movement according to reStructuredText syntax;
;; - Some other convenience functions.
;;
;; See the accompanying document in the docutils documentation about
;; the contents of this package and how to use it.
;;
;; For more information about reStructuredText, see
;; http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html
;;
;; For full details on how to use the contents of this file, see
;; http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/emacs.html
;;
;;
;; There are a number of convenient key bindings provided by rst-mode.
;; For more on bindings, see rst-mode-map below.  There are also many variables
;; that can be customized, look for defcustom in this file.
;;
;; If you use the table-of-contents feature, you may want to add a hook to
;; update the TOC automatically every time you adjust a section title::
;;
;;   (add-hook 'rst-adjust-hook 'rst-toc-update)
;;
;; Syntax highlighting: font-lock is enabled by default.  If you want to turn
;; off syntax highlighting to rst-mode, you can use the following::
;;
;;   (setq font-lock-global-modes '(not rst-mode ...))
;;
;;
;;
;; Customization is done by customizable variables contained in customization
;; group "rst" and subgroups.  Group "rst" is contained in the "wp" group.
;;

;;; DOWNLOAD

;; The latest release of this file lies in the docutils source code repository:
;;   http://docutils.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/docutils/trunk/docutils/tools/editors/emacs/rst.el

;;; INSTALLATION

;; Add the following lines to your init file:
;;
;;   (require 'rst)
;;
;; If you are using `.txt' as a standard extension for reST files as
;; http://docutils.sourceforge.net/FAQ.html#what-s-the-standard-filename-extension-for-a-restructuredtext-file
;; suggests you may use one of the `Local Variables in Files' mechanism Emacs
;; provides to set the major mode automatically.  For instance you may use::
;;
;;    .. -*- mode: rst -*-
;;
;; in the very first line of your file.  The following code is useful if you
;; want automatically enter rst-mode from any file with compatible extensions:
;;
;; (setq auto-mode-alist
;;       (append '(("\\.txt\\'" . rst-mode)
;;                 ("\\.rst\\'" . rst-mode)
;;                 ("\\.rest\\'" . rst-mode)) auto-mode-alist))

;; Section Adornment Adjustment
;; ============================
;;
;; The following functions implement a smart automatic title sectioning feature.
;; The idea is that with the cursor sitting on a section title, we try to get as
;; much information from context and try to do the best thing automatically.
;; This function can be invoked many times and/or with prefix argument to rotate
;; between the various sectioning adornments.
;;
;; Definitions: the two forms of sectioning define semantically separate section
;; levels.  A sectioning ADORNMENT consists in:
;;
;;   - a CHARACTER
;;
;;   - a STYLE which can be either of 'simple' or 'over-and-under'.
;;
;;   - an INDENT (meaningful for the over-and-under style only) which determines
;;     how many characters and over-and-under style is hanging outside of the
;;     title at the beginning and ending.
;;
;; Here are two examples of adornments (| represents the window border, column
;; 0):
;;
;;                                  |
;; 1. char: '-'   e                 |Some Title
;;    style: simple                 |----------
;;                                  |
;; 2. char: '='                     |==============
;;    style: over-and-under         |  Some Title
;;    indent: 2                     |==============
;;                                  |
;;
;; Some notes:
;;
;; - The underlining character that is used depends on context. The file is
;;   scanned to find other sections and an appropriate character is selected.
;;   If the function is invoked on a section that is complete, the character is
;;   rotated among the existing section adornments.
;;
;;   Note that when rotating the characters, if we come to the end of the
;;   hierarchy of adornments, the variable rst-preferred-adornments is
;;   consulted to propose a new underline adornment, and if continued, we cycle
;;   the adornments all over again.  Set this variable to nil if you want to
;;   limit the underlining character propositions to the existing adornments in
;;   the file.
;;
;; - An underline/overline that is not extended to the column at which it should
;;   be hanging is dubbed INCOMPLETE.  For example::
;;
;;      |Some Title
;;      |-------
;;
;; Examples of default invocation:
;;
;;   |Some Title       --->    |Some Title
;;   |                         |----------
;;
;;   |Some Title       --->    |Some Title
;;   |-----                    |----------
;;
;;   |                         |------------
;;   | Some Title      --->    | Some Title
;;   |                         |------------
;;
;; In over-and-under style, when alternating the style, a variable is
;; available to select how much default indent to use (it can be zero).  Note
;; that if the current section adornment already has an indent, we don't
;; adjust it to the default, we rather use the current indent that is already
;; there for adjustment (unless we cycle, in which case we use the indent
;; that has been found previously).

This function is meant to be invoked possibly multiple times, and
can vary its behavior with a true TOGGLE-STYLE argument, or with
a REVERSE-DIRECTION argument.

General Behavior
================

The next action it takes depends on context around the point, and
it is meant to be invoked possibly more than once to rotate among
the various possibilities.  Basically, this function deals with:

- adding a adornment if the title does not have one;

- adjusting the length of the underline characters to fit a
  modified title;

- rotating the adornment in the set of already existing
  sectioning adornments used in the file;

- switching between simple and over-and-under styles.

You should normally not have to read all the following, just
invoke the method and it will do the most obvious thing that you
would expect.


Adornment Definitions
=====================

The adornments consist in

1. a CHARACTER

2. a STYLE which can be either `simple' or `over-and-under'.

3. an INDENT (meaningful for the over-and-under style only)
   which determines how many characters and over-and-under
   style is hanging outside of the title at the beginning and
   ending.

See source code for mode details.


Detailed Behavior Description
=============================

Here are the gory details of the algorithm (it seems quite
complicated, but really, it does the most obvious thing in all
the particular cases):

Before applying the adornment change, the cursor is placed on
the closest line that could contain a section title.

Case 1: No Adornment
--------------------

If the current line has no adornment around it,

- search backwards for the last previous adornment, and apply
  the adornment one level lower to the current line.  If there
  is no defined level below this previous adornment, we suggest
  the most appropriate of the `rst-preferred-adornments'.

  If REVERSE-DIRECTION is true, we simply use the previous
  adornment found directly.

- if there is no adornment found in the given direction, we use
  the first of `rst-preferred-adornments'.

TOGGLE-STYLE forces a toggle of the prescribed adornment style.

Case 2: Incomplete Adornment
----------------------------

If the current line does have an existing adornment, but the
adornment is incomplete, that is, the underline/overline does
not extend to exactly the end of the title line (it is either
too short or too long), we simply extend the length of the
underlines/overlines to fit exactly the section title.

If TOGGLE-STYLE we toggle the style of the adornment as well.

REVERSE-DIRECTION has no effect in this case.

Case 3: Complete Existing Adornment
-----------------------------------

If the adornment is complete (i.e. the underline (overline)
length is already adjusted to the end of the title line), we
search/parse the file to establish the hierarchy of all the
adornments (making sure not to include the adornment around
point), and we rotate the current title's adornment from within
that list (by default, going *down* the hierarchy that is present
in the file, i.e. to a lower section level).  This is meant to be
used potentially multiple times, until the desired adornment is
found around the title.

If we hit the boundary of the hierarchy, exactly one choice from
the list of preferred adornments is suggested/chosen, the first
of those adornment that has not been seen in the file yet (and
not including the adornment around point), and the next
invocation rolls over to the other end of the hierarchy (i.e. it
cycles).  This allows you to avoid having to set which character
to use.

If REVERSE-DIRECTION is true, the effect is to change the
direction of rotation in the hierarchy of adornments, thus
instead going *up* the hierarchy.

However, if TOGGLE-STYLE, we do not rotate the adornment, but
instead simply toggle the style of the current adornment (this
should be the most common way to toggle the style of an existing
complete adornment).


Point Location
==============

The invocation of this function can be carried out anywhere
within the section title line, on an existing underline or
overline, as well as on an empty line following a section title.
This is meant to be as convenient as possible.


Indented Sections
=================

Indented section titles such as ::

   My Title
   --------

are invalid in reStructuredText and thus not recognized by the
parser.  This code will thus not work in a way that would support
indented sections (it would be ambiguous anyway).


Joint Sections
==============

Section titles that are right next to each other may not be
treated well.  More work might be needed to support those, and
special conditions on the completeness of existing adornments
might be required to make it non-ambiguous.

For now we assume that the adornments are disjoint, that is,
there is at least a single line between the titles/adornment
lines."
