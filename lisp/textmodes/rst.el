;;; Commentary:

;; This package provides major mode rst-mode, which supports documents marked
;; up using the reStructuredText format.  Support includes font locking as well
;; as a lot of convenience functions for editing.  It does this by defining a
;; Emacs major mode: rst-mode (ReST).  This mode is derived from text-mode.
;; This package also contains:
;;
;; - Functions to automatically adjust and cycle the section underline
;;   adornments;
;; - A mode that displays the table of contents and allows you to jump anywhere
;;   from it;
;; - Functions to insert and automatically update a TOC in your source
;;   document;
;; - Function to insert list, processing item bullets and enumerations
;;   automatically;
;; - Font-lock highlighting of most reStructuredText structures;
;; - Indentation and filling according to reStructuredText syntax;
;; - Cursor movement according to reStructuredText syntax;
;; - Some other convenience functions.
;;
;; See the accompanying document in the docutils documentation about
;; the contents of this package and how to use it.
;;
;; For more information about reStructuredText, see
;; http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html
;;
;; For full details on how to use the contents of this file, see
;; http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/user/emacs.html
;;
;; There are a number of convenient key bindings provided by rst-mode.  For the
;; bindings, try C-c C-h when in rst-mode.  There are also many variables that
;; can be customized, look for defcustom in this file or look for the "rst"
;; customization group contained in the "wp" group.
;;
;; If you use the table-of-contents feature, you may want to add a hook to
;; update the TOC automatically every time you adjust a section title::
;;
;;   (add-hook 'rst-adjust-hook 'rst-toc-update)
;;
;; Syntax highlighting: font-lock is enabled by default.  If you want to turn
;; off syntax highlighting to rst-mode, you can use the following::
;;
;;   (setq font-lock-global-modes '(not rst-mode ...))
;;

;;; DOWNLOAD

;; The latest release of this file lies in the docutils source code repository:
;;   http://docutils.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/docutils/trunk/docutils/tools/editors/emacs/rst.el

;;; INSTALLATION

;; Add the following lines to your init file:
;;
;;   (require 'rst)
;;
;; If you are using `.txt' as a standard extension for reST files as
;; http://docutils.sourceforge.net/FAQ.html#what-s-the-standard-filename-extension-for-a-restructuredtext-file
;; suggests you may use one of the `Local Variables in Files' mechanism Emacs
;; provides to set the major mode automatically.  For instance you may use::
;;
;;    .. -*- mode: rst -*-
;;
;; in the very first line of your file.  The following code is useful if you
;; want automatically enter rst-mode from any file with compatible extensions:
;;
;; (setq auto-mode-alist
;;       (append '(("\\.txt\\'" . rst-mode)
;;                 ("\\.rst\\'" . rst-mode)
;;                 ("\\.rest\\'" . rst-mode)) auto-mode-alist))

A list with a keyword in the car.  Each element of the cdr of such

;; Section adornment adjustment

;; The following functions implement a smart automatic title sectioning feature.
;; The idea is that with the cursor sitting on a section title, we try to get as
;; much information from context and try to do the best thing automatically.
;; This function can be invoked many times and/or with prefix argument to rotate
;; between the various sectioning adornments.
;;
;; Some notes:
;;
;; - The underlining character that is used depends on context. The file is
;;   scanned to find other sections and an appropriate character is selected.
;;   If the function is invoked on a section that is complete, the character is
;;   rotated among the existing section adornments.
;;
;;   Note that when rotating the characters, if we come to the end of the
;;   hierarchy of adornments, the variable `rst-preferred-adornments' is
;;   consulted to propose a new underline adornment, and if continued, we cycle
;;   the adornments all over again.  Set this variable to nil if you want to
;;   limit the underlining character propositions to the existing adornments in
;;   the file.
;;
;; - An underline/overline that is not extended to the column at which it should
;;   be hanging is dubbed INCOMPLETE.  For example::
;;
;;      |Some Title
;;      |-------
;;
;; Examples of default invocation:
;;
;;   |Some Title       --->    |Some Title
;;   |                         |----------
;;
;;   |Some Title       --->    |Some Title
;;   |-----                    |----------
;;
;;   |                         |------------
;;   | Some Title      --->    | Some Title
;;   |                         |------------
;;
;; In over-and-under style, when alternating the style, a variable is
;; available to select how much default indent to use (it can be zero).  Note
;; that if the current section adornment already has an indent, we don't
;; adjust it to the default, we rather use the current indent that is already
;; there for adjustment (unless we cycle, in which case we use the indent
;; that has been found previously).

  "Adjust/rotate the section adornment for the section title around point.
The action this function takes depends on context around the
point, and it is meant to be invoked possibly more than once to
rotate among the various possibilities.  Basically, this function
deals with:

- adding an adornment if the title does not have one;

- adjusting the length of the underline characters to fit a
  modified title;

- rotating the adornment in the set of already existing
  sectioning adornments used in the file;

- switching between simple and over-and-under styles by giving
  TOGGLE-STYLE.

Return nil if the function did something.  If the function were
not able to do something return an argument list for `message' to
inform the user about what failed.

The following is a detailed description but you should normally
not have to read it.

Before applying the adornment change, the cursor is placed on the
closest line that could contain a section title if such is found
around the cursor.  Then the following cases are distinguished.

* Case 1: No Adornment

  If the current line has no adornment around it,

  - search for a previous adornment, and apply this adornment (unless
    `rst-new-adornment-down') or one level lower (otherwise) to the current
    line.  If there is no defined level below this previous adornment, we
    suggest the most appropriate of the `rst-preferred-adornments'.

    If REVERSE is true, we simply use the previous adornment found
    directly.

  - if there is no adornment found in the given direction, we use the first of
    `rst-preferred-adornments'.

  TOGGLE-STYLE forces a toggle of the prescribed adornment style.

* Case 2: Incomplete Adornment

  If the current line does have an existing adornment, but the adornment is
  incomplete, that is, the underline/overline does not extend to exactly the
  end of the title line (it is either too short or too long), we simply extend
  the length of the underlines/overlines to fit exactly the section title.

  If TOGGLE-STYLE we toggle the style of the adornment as well.

  REVERSE has no effect in this case.

* Case 3: Complete Existing Adornment

  If the adornment is complete (i.e. the underline (overline) length is already
  adjusted to the end of the title line), we rotate the current title's
  adornment according to the adornment hierarchy found in the buffer.  This is
  meant to be used potentially multiple times, until the desired adornment is
  found around the title.

  If we hit the boundary of the hierarchy, exactly one choice from the list of
  preferred adornments is suggested/chosen, the first of those adornment that
  has not been seen in the buffer yet, and the next invocation rolls over to
  the other end of the hierarchy (i.e. it cycles).

  If REVERSE is we go up in the hierarchy.  Otherwise we go down.

  However, if TOGGLE-STYLE, we do not rotate the adornment, but instead simply
  toggle the style of the current adornment."

  "Insert a list item at the current point.

The command can insert a new list or a continuing list.  When it is called at a
non-list line, it will promote to insert new list.  When it is called at a list
line, it will insert a list with the same list style.

1. When inserting a new list:

User is asked to select the item style first, for example (a), i), +.  Use TAB
for completion and choices.

 (a) If user selects bullets or #, it's just added.
 (b) If user selects enumerations, a further prompt is given.  User needs to
     input a starting item, for example `e' for `A)' style.

The position of the new list is arranged according to whether or not the
current line and the previous line are blank lines.

2. When continuing a list, one thing needs to be noticed:

List style alphabetical list, such as `a.', and roman numerical list, such as
`i.', have some overlapping items, for example `v.' The function can deal with
the problem elegantly in most situations.  But when those overlapped list are
preceded by a blank line, it is hard to determine which type to use
automatically.  The function uses alphabetical list by default.  If you want
roman numerical list, just use a prefix to set PREFER-ROMAN."
