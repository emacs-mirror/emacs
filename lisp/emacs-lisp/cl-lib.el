;;; Commentary:

;; These are extensions to Emacs Lisp that provide a degree of
;; Common Lisp compatibility, beyond what is already built-in
;; in Emacs Lisp.
;;
;; This package was written by Dave Gillespie; it is a complete
;; rewrite of Cesar Quiroz's original cl.el package of December 1986.
;;
;; Bug reports, comments, and suggestions are welcome!

;; This file contains the portions of the Common Lisp extensions
;; package which should always be present.


;;; Change Log:

;; Version 2.02 (30 Jul 93):
;;  * Added "cl-compat.el" file, extra compatibility with old package.
;;  * Added `lexical-let' and `lexical-let*'.
;;  * Added `define-modify-macro', `callf', and `callf2'.
;;  * Added `ignore-errors'.
;;  * Changed `(setf (nthcdr N PLACE) X)' to work when N is zero.
;;  * Merged `*gentemp-counter*' into `*gensym-counter*'.
;;  * Extended `subseq' to allow negative START and END like `substring'.
;;  * Added `in-ref', `across-ref', `elements of-ref' loop clauses.
;;  * Added `concat', `vconcat' loop clauses.
;;  * Cleaned up a number of compiler warnings.

;; Version 2.01 (7 Jul 93):
;;  * Added support for FSF version of Emacs 19.
;;  * Added `add-hook' for Emacs 18 users.
;;  * Added `defsubst*' and `symbol-macrolet'.
;;  * Added `maplist', `mapc', `mapl', `mapcan', `mapcon'.
;;  * Added `map', `concatenate', `reduce', `merge'.
;;  * Added `revappend', `nreconc', `tailp', `tree-equal'.
;;  * Added `assert', `check-type', `typecase', `typep', and `deftype'.
;;  * Added destructuring and `&environment' support to `defmacro*'.
;;  * Added destructuring to `loop', and added the following clauses:
;;      `elements', `frames', `overlays', `intervals', `buffers', `key-seqs'.
;;  * Renamed `delete' to `delete*' and `remove' to `remove*'.
;;  * Completed support for all keywords in `remove*', `substitute', etc.
;;  * Added `most-positive-float' and company.
;;  * Fixed hash tables to work with latest Lucid Emacs.
;;  * `proclaim' forms are no longer compile-time-evaluating; use `declaim'.
;;  * Syntax for `warn' declarations has changed.
;;  * Improved implementation of `random*'.
;;  * Moved most sequence functions to a new file, cl-seq.el.
;;  * Moved `eval-when' into cl-macs.el.
;;  * Moved `pushnew' and `adjoin' to cl.el for most common cases.
;;  * Moved `provide' forms down to ends of files.
;;  * Changed expansion of `pop' to something that compiles to better code.
;;  * Changed so that no patch is required for Emacs 19 byte compiler.
;;  * Made more things dependent on `optimize' declarations.
;;  * Added a partial implementation of struct print functions.
;;  * Miscellaneous minor changes.

;; Version 2.00:
;;  * First public release of this package.
