  "Search for the next region of text whose PROPERTY matches VALUE.

If not found, return nil and don't move point.
If found, move point to end of the region and return a `prop-match'
object describing the match.  To access the details of the match,
use `prop-match-beginning' and `prop-match-end' for the buffer
positions that limit the region, and `prop-match-value' for the
value of PROPERTY in the region.

PREDICATE is used to decide whether a value of PROPERTY should be
considered as matching VALUE.
If PREDICATE is t, that means a value must `equal' VALUE to be
considered a match.
If PREDICATE is nil, a value will match if it is non-nil and
is NOT `equal' to VALUE.
If PREDICATE is a function, it will be called with two arguments:
VALUE and the value of PROPERTY.  The function should return
non-nil if these two values are to be considered a match.

If NOT-CURRENT is non-nil, the function will search for the first
region that doesn't include point and has a value of PROPERTY
that matches VALUE."
