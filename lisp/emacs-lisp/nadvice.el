;;; Commentary:

;; This package lets you add behavior (which we call "piece of advice") to
;; existing functions, like the old `advice.el' package, but with much fewer
;; bells and whistles.  It comes in 2 parts:
;;
;; - The first part lets you add/remove functions, similarly to
;;   add/remove-hook, from any "place" (i.e. as accepted by `setf') that
;;   holds a function.
;;   This part provides mainly 2 macros: `add-function' and `remove-function'.
;;
;; - The second part provides `advice-add' and `advice-remove' which are
;;   refined version of the previous macros specially tailored for the case
;;   where the place that we want to modify is a `symbol-function'.

;;; Code:

  "Add a piece of advice on the function stored at PLACE.
FUNCTION describes the code to add.  WHERE describes where to add it.
WHERE can be explained by showing the resulting new function, as the
result of combining FUNCTION and the previous value of PLACE, which we
call OLDFUN here:
`:before'	(lambda (&rest r) (apply FUNCTION r) (apply OLDFUN r))
`:after'	(lambda (&rest r) (prog1 (apply OLDFUN r) (apply FUNCTION r)))
`:around'	(lambda (&rest r) (apply FUNCTION OLDFUN r))

`:filter-args'	(lambda (&rest r) (apply OLDFUN (funcall FUNCTION r)))
`:filter-return'(lambda (&rest r) (funcall FUNCTION (apply OLDFUN r)))
If FUNCTION was already added, do nothing.
PROPS is an alist of additional properties, among which the following have
a special meaning:
- `name': a string or symbol.  It can be used to refer to this piece of advice.
- `depth': a number indicating a preference w.r.t ordering.
  The default depth is 0.  By convention, a depth of 100 means that
  the advice  should be innermost (i.e. at the end of the list),
  whereas a depth of -100 means that the advice should be outermost.

If PLACE is a symbol, its `default-value' will be affected.
Use (local \\='SYMBOL) if you want to apply FUNCTION to SYMBOL buffer-locally.
Use (var VAR) if you want to apply FUNCTION to the (lexical) VAR.

If one of FUNCTION or OLDFUN is interactive, then the resulting function
is also interactive.  There are 3 cases:
- FUNCTION is not interactive: the interactive spec of OLDFUN is used.
- The interactive spec of FUNCTION is itself a function: it should take one
  argument (the interactive spec of OLDFUN, which it can pass to
  `advice-eval-interactive-spec') and return the list of arguments to use.
- Else, use the interactive spec of FUNCTION and ignore the one of OLDFUN."
