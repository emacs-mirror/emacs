;;; Commentary:

;; While packages managed by package.el use tarballs for distributing
;; the source code, this extension allows for packages to be fetched
;; and updated directly from a version control system.
;;
;; To install a package from source use `package-vc-install'.  If you
;; aren't interested in activating a package, you can use
;; `package-vc-checkout' instead, which will prompt you for a target
;; directory.  If you wish to re-use an existing checkout, the command
;; `package-vc-install-from-checkout' will create a symbolic link and
;; prepare the package.
;;
;; If you make local changes that you wish to share with an upstream
;; maintainer, the command `package-vc-prepare-patch' can prepare
;; these as patches to send via Email.

;;; TODO:

;; - Allow maintaining patches that are ported back onto regular
;;   packages and maintained between versions.
;;
;; - Add a heuristic for guessing a `:lisp-dir' when cloning directly
;;  from a URL.

If PACKAGE is a string containing an URL, download the package

the name of the package from the URL.  This can be overridden by
passing the optional argument NAME.  If PACKAGE is a cons-cell,
it should have the form (NAME . SPEC), where NAME is a symbol
indicating the package name and SPEC is a plist as described in
`package-vc-selected-packages'.  Otherwise PACKAGE should be a
symbol whose name is the package name, and the URL for the
package will be taken from the package's metadata.

By default, this function installs the last version of the package
available from its repository, but if REV is given and non-nil, it
specifies the revision to install.  If REV has the special value
`:last-release' (interactively, the prefix argument), that stands
for the last released version of the package.

Optional argument BACKEND specifies the VC backend to use for cloning
the package's repository; this is only possible if NAME-OR-URL is a URL,
a string.  If BACKEND is omitted or nil, the function
uses `package-vc-heuristic-alist' to guess the backend.
Note that by default, a VC package will be prioritized over a
