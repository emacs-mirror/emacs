;;; Commentary:

;; This file dumps a backtrace on stderr when an error is thrown.  It
;; has no dependencies on any Lisp libraries and is thus used for
;; generating backtraces for bugs in the early parts of bootstrapping.
;; It is also always used in batch model.  It was introduced in Emacs
;; 29, before which there was no backtrace available during early
;; bootstrap.

function, intended for use in debugging the early parts
of the build process."

  "Print an error message with a backtrace of active Lisp function calls.
The output stream used is the value of `standard-output'.

The Emacs core calls this function after an error has been
signaled, and supplies two ARGS.  These are the symbol
`error' (which is ignored) and a cons of the error symbol and the
error data.

`debug-early' is a simplified version of `debug', and is
available during the early parts of the build process.  It is
superseded by `debug' after enough Lisp has been loaded to
support the latter, except in batch mode which always uses
`debug-early'.

\(In versions of Emacs prior to Emacs 29, no backtrace was
available before `debug' was usable.)"
