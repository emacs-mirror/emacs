;;; Commentary:

;; * Use `testcover-start' to instrument a Lisp file for coverage testing.
;; * Use `testcover-mark-all' to add overlay "splotches" to the Lisp file's
;;   buffer to show where coverage is lacking.  Normally, a red splotch
;;   indicates the form was never evaluated; a brown splotch means it always
;;   evaluated to the same value.
;; * Use `testcover-next-mark' (bind it to a key!) to jump to the next spot
;;   that has a splotch.

;; * Basic algorithm: use `edebug' to mark up the function text with
;;   instrumentation callbacks, walk the instrumented code looking for
;;   forms which don't return or always return the same value, then use
;;   Edebug's before and after hooks to replace its code coverage with ours.
;; * To show good coverage, we want to see two values for every form, except
;;   functions that always return the same value and `defconst' variables
;;   need show only one value for good coverage.  To avoid the brown
;;   splotch, the definitions for constants and 1-valued functions must
;;   precede the references.
;; * Use the macro `1value' in your Lisp code to mark spots where the local
;;   code environment causes a function or variable to always have the same
;;   value, but the function or variable is not intrinsically 1-valued.
;; * Use the macro `noreturn' in your Lisp code to mark function calls that
;;   never return, because of the local code environment, even though the
;;   function being called is capable of returning in other cases.

;; Problems:
;; * `equal', which is used to compare the results of repeatedly executing
;;   a form, has a couple of shortcomings.  It considers strings to be the same
;;   if they only differ in properties, and it raises an error when asked to
;;   compare circular lists.
;; * Because we have only a "1value" class and no "always nil" class, we have
;;   to treat as potentially 1-valued any `and' whose last term is 1-valued,
;;   in case the last term is always nil.  Example:
;;     (and (< (point) 1000) (forward-char 10))
;;   This form always returns nil.  Similarly, `or', `if', and `cond' are
;;   treated as potentially 1-valued if all clauses are, in case those
;;   values are always nil.  Unlike truly 1-valued functions, it is not an
;;   error if these "potentially" 1-valued forms actually return differing
;;   values.

;;; Coverage Analysis

;; The top level function for initializing code coverage is
;; `testcover-analyze-coverage', which recursively walks the form it is
;; passed, which should have already been instrumented by
;; edebug-read-and-maybe-wrap-form, and initializes the associated
;; code coverage vectors, which should have already been created by
;; `edebug-clear-coverage'.
;;
;; The purpose of the analysis is to identify forms which can only
;; ever return a single value.  These forms can be considered to have
;; adequate code coverage even if only executed once.  In addition,
;; forms which will never return, such as error signals, can be
;; identified and treated correctly.
;;
;; The code coverage vector entries for the beginnings of forms will
;; be changed to `ok-coverage.', except for the beginnings of forms
;; which should never return, which will be changed to
;; (noreturn . AFTER-INDEX) so that testcover-before can set the entry
;; for the end of the form just before it is executed.
;;
;; Entries for the ends of forms may be changed to `1value' if
;; analysis determines the form will only ever return a single value,
;; or `maybe' if the form could potentially only ever return a single
;; value.
;;
;; An example of a potentially 1-valued form is an `and' whose last
;; term is 1-valued, in case the last term is always nil.  Example:
;;
;; (and (< (point) 1000) (forward-char 10))
;;
;; This form always returns nil.  Similarly, `or', `if', and `cond'
;; are treated as potentially 1-valued if all clauses are, in case
;; those values are always nil.  Unlike truly 1-valued functions, it
;; is not an error if these "potentially" 1-valued forms actually
;; return differing values.
