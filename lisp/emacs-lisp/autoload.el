;;; Commentary:

;; This code helps GNU Emacs maintainers keep the loaddefs.el file up to
;; date.  It interprets magic cookies of the form ";;;###autoload" in
;; lisp source files in various useful ways.  To learn more, read the
;; source; if you're going to use this, you'd better be able to.

;;; Code:

(require 'lisp-mode)			;for `doc-string-elt' properties.
(require 'lisp-mnt)

  "File into which to write autoload definitions.
A Lisp file can set this in its local variables section to make
its autoloads go somewhere else.

follows:
 - If a Lisp file defined `generated-autoload-file' as a
   file-local variable, use its containing directory.
 - Otherwise use the \"lisp\" subdirectory of `source-directory'.

The autoload file is assumed to contain a trailer starting with a
FormFeed character.")

We use these in incremental updates of the output file to decide
if we need to rescan an input file.  If you set this to nil,
then we use the timestamp of the output file instead.  As a result:
 - for fixed inputs, the output will be the same every time
 - incremental updates of the output file might not be correct if:
   i) the timestamp of the output file cannot be trusted (at least
     relative to that of the input files)
   ii) any of the input files can be modified during the time it takes
      to create the output
   iii) only a subset of the input files are scanned
   These issues are unlikely to happen in practice, and would arguably
   represent bugs in the build system.  Item iii) will happen if you
   use a command like `update-file-autoloads', though, since it only
   checks a single input file.")
