;;; Commentary:
;;
;; If you want to profile a bunch of functions, set elp-function-list
;; to the list of symbols, then do a M-x elp-instrument-list.  This
;; hacks those functions so that profiling information is recorded
;; whenever they are called.  To print out the current results, use
;; M-x elp-results.  If you want output to go to standard-output
;; instead of a separate buffer, setq elp-use-standard-output to
;; non-nil.  With elp-reset-after-results set to non-nil, profiling
;; information will be reset whenever the results are displayed.  You
;; can also reset all profiling info at any time with M-x
;; elp-reset-all.
;;
;; You can also instrument all functions in a package, provided that
;; the package follows the GNU coding standard of a common textual
;; prefix.  Use M-x elp-instrument-package for this.
;;
;; If you want to sort the results, set elp-sort-by-function to some
;; predicate function.  The three most obvious choices are predefined:
;; elp-sort-by-call-count, elp-sort-by-average-time, and
;; elp-sort-by-total-time.  Also, you can prune from the output, all
;; functions that have been called fewer than a given number of times
;; by setting elp-report-limit.
;;
;; Elp can instrument byte-compiled functions just as easily as
;; interpreted functions, but it cannot instrument macros.  However,
;; when you redefine a function (e.g. with eval-defun), you'll need to
;; re-instrument it with M-x elp-instrument-function.  This will also
;; reset profiling information for that function.  Elp can handle
;; interactive functions (i.e. commands), but of course any time spent
;; idling for user prompts will show up in the timing results.
;;
;; You can also designate a `master' function.  Profiling times will
;; be gathered for instrumented functions only during execution of
;; this master function.  Thus, if you have some defuns like:
;;
;;  (defun foo () (do-something-time-intensive))
;;  (defun bar () (foo))
;;  (defun baz () (bar) (foo))
;;
;; and you want to find out the amount of time spent in bar and foo,
;; but only during execution of bar, make bar the master.  The call of
;; foo from baz will not add to foo's total timing sums.  Use M-x
;; elp-set-master and M-x elp-unset-master to utilize this feature.
;; Only one master function can be set at a time.

;; You can restore any function's original function definition with
;; elp-restore-function.  The other instrument, restore, and reset
;; functions are provided for symmetry.

;; Here is a list of variable you can use to customize elp:
;;   elp-function-list
;;   elp-reset-after-results
;;   elp-sort-by-function
;;   elp-report-limit
;;
;; Here is a list of the interactive commands you can use:
;;   elp-instrument-function
;;   elp-restore-function
;;   elp-instrument-list
;;   elp-restore-list
;;   elp-instrument-package
;;   elp-restore-all
;;   elp-reset-function
;;   elp-reset-list
;;   elp-reset-all
;;   elp-set-master
;;   elp-unset-master
;;   elp-results

;; Note that there are plenty of factors that could make the times
;; reported unreliable, including the accuracy and granularity of your
;; system clock, and the overhead spent in lisp calculating and
;; recording the intervals.  I figure the latter is pretty constant,
;; so while the times may not be entirely accurate, I think they'll
;; give you a good feel for the relative amount of work spent in the
;; various lisp routines you are profiling.  Note further that times
;; are calculated using wall-clock time, so other system load will
;; affect accuracy too.

;;; Background:

;; This program was inspired by the only two existing Emacs Lisp
;; profilers that I'm aware of, Boaz Ben-Zvi's profile.el, and Root
;; Boy Jim's profiler.el. Both were written for Emacs 18 and both were
;; pretty good first shots at profiling, but I found that they didn't
;; provide the functionality or interface that I wanted, so I wrote
;; this.  I've tested elp in XEmacs 19 and Emacs 19.  There's no point
;; in even trying to make this work with Emacs 18.

;; Unlike previous profilers, elp uses Emacs 19's built-in function
;; current-time to return interval times.  This obviates the need for
;; both an external C program and Emacs processes to communicate with
;; such a program, and thus simplifies the package as a whole.

;; TBD:
;; Make this act like a real profiler, so that it records time spent
;; in all branches of execution.
