;;; Commentary:

;; This package generates the main lisp/loaddefs.el file, as well as
;; all the other loaddefs files, like calendar/diary-loaddefs.el, etc.

;; The main entry point is `loaddefs-generate' (normally called
;; from loaddefs-generate-batch via lisp/Makefile).
;;
;; The "other" loaddefs files are specified either via a file-local
;; setting of `generated-autoload-file', or by specifying
;;
;;   ;;;###foo-autoload
;;
;; This makes the autoload go to foo-loaddefs.el in the current directory.
;; Normal ;;;###autoload specs go to the main loaddefs file.

;;; Code:
