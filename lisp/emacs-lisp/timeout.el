;;; Commentary:

;; timeout is a small Elisp library that provides higher order functions to
;; throttle or debounce Elisp functions.  This is useful for corralling
;; over-eager code that:
;; (i) is slow and blocks Emacs, and
;; (ii) does not provide customization options to limit how often it runs,
;;
;; To throttle a function FUNC to run no more than once every 2 seconds, run
;; (timeout-throttle 'func 2.0)
;;
;; To debounce a function FUNC to run after a delay of 0.3 seconds, run
;; (timeout-debounce 'func 0.3)
;;
;; To create a new throttled or debounced version of FUNC instead, run
;;
;; (timeout-throttled-func 'func 2.0)
;; (timeout-debounced-func 'func 0.3)
;;
;; You can bind this via fset or defalias:
;;
;; (defalias 'throttled-func (timeout-throttled-func 'func 2.0))
;; (fset     'throttled-func (timeout-throttled-func 'func 2.0))
;;
;; Dynamic duration is supported by passing a symbol or function instead of
;; a number:
;;
;; (defvar my-timeout 1.5)
;; (timeout-throttle 'func 'my-timeout)  ; uses value of my-timeout
;; (timeout-throttle 'func (lambda () (if busy-p 0.1 2.0)))  ; conditional
;;
;; The interactive spec and documentation of FUNC is carried over to the new
;; function.
