;;; Commentary:

;; This takes a piece of Elisp code, and eliminates all free variables from
;; lambda expressions.  The user entry point is `cconv-closure-convert'.
;; All macros should be expanded beforehand.
;;
;; Here is a brief explanation how this code works.
;; Firstly, we analyze the tree by calling `cconv-analyze-form'.
;; This function finds all mutated variables, all functions that are suitable
;; for lambda lifting and all variables captured by closure.  It passes the tree
;; once, returning a list of three lists.
;;
;; Then we calculate the intersection of the first and third lists returned by
;; `cconv-analyze-form' to find all mutated variables that are captured by
;; closure.

;; Armed with this data, we call `cconv-convert', that rewrites the
;; tree recursively, lifting lambdas where possible, building closures where it
;; is needed and eliminating mutable variables used in closure.
;;
;; We do following replacements :
;; (lambda (v1 ...) ... fv1 fv2 ...) => (lambda (v1 ... fv1 fv2 ) ... fv1 fv2 .)
;; if the function is suitable for lambda lifting (if all calls are known)
;;
;; (lambda (v0 ...) ... fv0 .. fv1 ...)  =>
;; (internal-make-closure (v0 ...) (fv0 ...) <doc>
;;   ... (internal-get-closed-var 0) ...  (internal-get-closed-var 1) ...)
;;
;; If the function has no free variables, we don't do anything.
;;
;; If a variable is mutated (updated by setq), and it is used in a closure
;; we wrap its definition with list: (list val) and we also replace
;; var => (car-safe var) wherever this variable is used, and also
;; (setq var value) => (setcar var value) where it is updated.
;;
;; If defun argument is closure mutable, we letbind it and wrap it's
;; definition with list.
;; (defun foo (... mutable-arg ...) ...) =>
;; (defun foo (... m-arg ...) (let ((m-arg (list m-arg))) ...))
;;
;;; Code:

;; TODO: (not just for cconv but also for the lexbind changes in general)
;; - let (e)debug find the value of lexical variables from the stack.
;; - make eval-region do the eval-sexp-add-defvars dance.
;; - byte-optimize-form should be applied before cconv.
;;   OTOH, the warnings emitted by cconv-analyze need to come before optimize
;;   since afterwards they can become obnoxious (warnings about an "unused
;;   variable" should not be emitted when the variable use has simply been
;;   optimized away).
;; - let macros specify that some let-bindings come from the same source,
;;   so the unused warning takes all uses into account.
;; - let interactive specs return a function to build the args (to stash into
;;   command-history).
;; - canonize code in macro-expand so we don't have to handle (let (var) body)
;;   and other oddities.
;; - new byte codes for unwind-protect so that closures aren't needed at all.
;; - Since we know here when a variable is not mutated, we could pass that
;;   info to the byte-compiler, e.g. by using a new `immutable-let'.
;; - call known non-escaping functions with `goto' rather than `call'.
