;;; Commentary:

;; Sequence-manipulation functions that complement basic functions
;; provided by subr.el.
;;
;; All functions are prefixed with "seq-".
;;
;; All provided functions work on lists, strings and vectors.
;;
;; Functions taking a predicate or iterating over a sequence using a
;; function as argument take the function as their first argument and
;; the sequence as their second argument.  All other functions take
;; the sequence as their first argument.
;;
;; While seq.el version 1.8 is in GNU ELPA for convenience, seq.el
;; version 2.0 requires Emacs>=25.1.
;;
;; seq.el can be extended to support new type of sequences.  Here are
;; the generic functions that must be implemented by new seq types:
;; - `seq-elt'
;; - `seq-length'
;; - `seq-do'
;; - `seq-p'
;; - `seq-subseq'
;; - `seq-into-sequence'
;; - `seq-copy'
;; - `seq-into'
;;
;; All functions are tested in test/automated/seq-tests.el
