;;; Commentary:

;; This program was inspired by the behavior of the "mouse documentation
;; window" on many Lisp Machine systems; as you type a function's symbol
;; name as part of a sexp, it will print the argument list for that
;; function.  Behavior is not identical; for example, you need not actually
;; type the function name, you need only move point around in a sexp that
;; calls it.  Also, if point is over a documented variable, it will print
;; the one-line documentation for that variable instead, to remind you of
;; that variable's meaning.

;; This mode is now enabled by default in all major modes that provide
;; support for it, such as `emacs-lisp-mode'.
;; This is controlled by `global-eldoc-mode'.

;; Major modes for other languages may use ElDoc by adding an
;; appropriate function to the buffer-local value of
;; `eldoc-documentation-functions'.

  "Hook of functions that produce doc strings.

A doc string is typically relevant if point is on a function-like
name, inside its arg list, or on any object with some associated
information.

Each hook function is called with at least one argument CALLBACK,
a function, and decides whether to display a doc short string
about the context around point.

- If that decision can be taken quickly, the hook function may
  call CALLBACK immediately following the protocol described
  below.  Alternatively it may ignore CALLBACK entirely and
  return either the doc string, or nil if there's no doc
  appropriate for the context.

- If the computation of said doc string (or the decision whether
  there is one at all) is expensive or can't be performed
  directly, the hook function should return a non-nil, non-string
  value and arrange for CALLBACK to be called at a later time,
  using asynchronous processes or other asynchronous mechanisms.

To call the CALLBACK function, the hook function must pass it an
obligatory argument DOCSTRING, a string containing the
documentation, followed by an optional list of arbitrary
keyword-value pairs of the form (:KEY VALUE :KEY2 VALUE2...).
The information contained in these pairs is understood by members
of `eldoc-display-functions', allowing the
documentation-producing backend to cooperate with specific
documentation-displaying frontends.  For example, KEY can be:

* `:thing', VALUE being a short string or symbol designating what
  is being reported on.  It can, for example be the name of the
  function whose signature is being documented, or the name of
  the variable whose docstring is being documented.
  `eldoc-display-in-echo-area', a member of
  `eldoc-display-functions', sometimes omits this information
  depending on space constraints;

* `:face', VALUE being a symbol designating a face which both
  `eldoc-display-in-echo-area' and `eldoc-display-in-buffer' will
  use when displaying `:thing''s value.

Finally, major modes should modify this hook locally, for
example:
  (add-hook \\='eldoc-documentation-functions #\\='foo-mode-eldoc nil t)
so that the global value (i.e. the default value of the hook) is
taken into account if the major mode specific function does not
return any documentation.")

- `eldoc-documentation-compose': calls all functions in the
  special hook and displays all of the resulting doc strings

- `eldoc-documentation-compose-eagerly': calls all functions in

  relative order of doc strings;

- `eldoc-documentation-enthusiast': calls all functions in the

returns something other than a string or nil and allows for some

other variable's protocol closely and endeavor to display the
resulting doc strings itself.
