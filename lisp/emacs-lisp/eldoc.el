;;; Commentary:

;; This program was inspired by the behavior of the "mouse documentation
;; window" on many Lisp Machine systems; as you type a function's symbol
;; name as part of a sexp, it will print the argument list for that
;; function.  Behavior is not identical; for example, you need not actually
;; type the function name, you need only move point around in a sexp that
;; calls it.  Also, if point is over a documented variable, it will print
;; the one-line documentation for that variable instead, to remind you of
;; that variable's meaning.

;; One useful way to enable this minor mode is to put the following in your
;; .emacs:
;;
;;      (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook 'eldoc-mode)
;;      (add-hook 'lisp-interaction-mode-hook 'eldoc-mode)
;;      (add-hook 'ielm-mode-hook 'eldoc-mode)
;;      (add-hook 'eval-expression-minibuffer-setup-hook 'eldoc-mode)

;; Major modes for other languages may use ElDoc by defining an
;; appropriate function as the buffer-local value of
;; `eldoc-documentation-function'.
