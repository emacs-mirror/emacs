;;; Commentary:

;; While working on the SML indentation code, the idea grew that maybe
;; I could write something generic to do the same thing, and at the
;; end of working on the SML code, I had a pretty good idea of what it
;; could look like.  That idea grew stronger after working on
;; LaTeX indentation.
;;
;; So at some point I decided to try it out, by writing a new
;; indentation code for Coq while trying to keep most of the code
;; "table driven", where only the tables are Coq-specific.  The result
;; (which was used for Beluga-mode as well) turned out to be based on
;; something pretty close to an operator precedence parser.

;; So here is another rewrite, this time following the actual principles of
;; operator precedence grammars.  Why OPG?  Even though they're among the
;; weakest kinds of parsers, these parsers have some very desirable properties
;; for Emacs:
;; - most importantly for indentation, they work equally well in either
;;   direction, so you can use them to parse backward from the indentation
;;   point to learn the syntactic context;
;; - they work locally, so there's no need to keep a cache of
;;   the parser's state;
;; - because of that locality, indentation also works just fine when earlier
;;   parts of the buffer are syntactically incorrect since the indentation
;;   looks at "as little as possible" of the buffer to make an indentation
;;   decision.
;; - they typically have no error handling and can't even detect a parsing
;;   error, so we don't have to worry about what to do in case of a syntax
;;   error because the parser just automatically does something.  Better yet,
;;   we can afford to use a sloppy grammar.

;; A good background to understand the development (especially the parts
;; building the 2D precedence tables and then computing the precedence levels
;; from it) can be found in pages 187-194 of "Parsing techniques" by Dick Grune
;; and Ceriel Jacobs (BookBody.pdf available at
;; http://dickgrune.com/Books/PTAPG_1st_Edition/).
;;
;; OTOH we had to kill many chickens, read many coffee grounds, and practice
;; untold numbers of black magic spells, to come up with the indentation code.
;; Since then, some of that code has been beaten into submission, but the
;; smie-indent-keyword is still pretty obscure.

;; Conflict resolution:
;;
;; - One source of conflicts is when you have:
;;     (exp ("IF" exp "ELSE" exp "END") ("CASE" cases "END"))
;;     (cases (cases "ELSE" insts) ...)
;;   The IF-rule implies ELSE=END and the CASE-rule implies ELSE>END.
;;   This can be resolved simply with:
;;     (exp ("IF" expelseexp "END") ("CASE" cases "END"))
;;     (expelseexp (exp) (exp "ELSE" exp))
;;     (cases (cases "ELSE" insts) ...)
;; - Another source of conflict is when a terminator/separator is used to
;;   terminate elements at different levels, as in:
;;     (decls ("VAR" vars) (decls "," decls))
;;     (vars (id) (vars "," vars))
;;   often these can be resolved by making the lexer distinguish the two
;;   kinds of commas, e.g. based on the following token.

;; TODO & BUGS:
;;
;; - We could try to resolve conflicts such as the IFexpELSEexpEND -vs-
;;   CASE(casesELSEexp)END automatically by changing the way BNF rules such as
;;   the IF-rule is handled.  I.e. rather than IF=ELSE and ELSE=END, we could
;;   turn them into IF<ELSE and ELSE>END and IF=END.
;; - Using the structural information SMIE gives us, it should be possible to
;;   implement a `smie-align' command that would automatically figure out what
;;   there is to align and how to do it (something like: align the token of
;;   lowest precedence that appears the same number of times on all lines,
;;   and then do the same on each side of that token).
;; - Maybe accept two juxtaposed non-terminals in the BNF under the condition
;;   that the first always ends with a terminal, or that the second always
;;   starts with a terminal.
;; - Permit EBNF-style notation.
;; - If the grammar has conflicts, the only way is to make the lexer return
;;   different tokens for the different cases.  This extra work performed by
;;   the lexer can be costly and unnecessary: we perform this extra work every
;;   time we find the conflicting token, regardless of whether or not the
;;   difference between the various situations is relevant to the current
;;   situation.  E.g. we may try to determine whether a ";" is a ";-operator"
;;   or a ";-separator" in a case where we're skipping over a "begin..end" pair
;;   where the difference doesn't matter.  For frequently occurring tokens and
;;   rarely occurring conflicts, this can be a significant performance problem.
;;   We could try and let the lexer return a "set of possible tokens
;;   plus a refinement function" and then let parser call the refinement
;;   function if needed.
;; - Make it possible to better specify the behavior in the face of
;;   syntax errors.  IOW provide some control over the choice of precedence
;;   levels within the limits of the constraints.  E.g. make it possible for
;;   the grammar to specify that "begin..end" has lower precedence than
;;   "Module..EndModule", so that if a "begin" is missing, scanning from the
;;   "end" will stop at "Module" rather than going past it (and similarly,
;;   scanning from "Module" should not stop at a spurious "end").

;;   the indent rules don't do what the user wants).  Not sure what to do.

;;; Building precedence level tables from BNF specs.

;; We have 4 different representations of a "grammar":
;; - a BNF table, which is a list of BNF rules of the form
;;   (NONTERM RHS1 ... RHSn) where each RHS is a list of terminals (tokens)
;;   or nonterminals.  Any element in these lists which does not appear as
;;   the `car' of a BNF rule is taken to be a terminal.
;; - A list of precedences (key word "precs"), is a list, sorted
;;   from lowest to highest precedence, of precedence classes that
;;   have the form (ASSOCIATIVITY TERMINAL1 .. TERMINALn), where
;;   ASSOCIATIVITY can be `assoc', `left', `right' or `nonassoc'.
;; - a 2 dimensional precedence table (key word "prec2"), is a 2D
;;   table recording the precedence relation (can be `<', `=', `>', or
;;   nil) between each pair of tokens.
;; - a precedence-level table (key word "grammar"), which is an alist
;;   giving for each token its left and right precedence level (a
;;   number or nil).  This is used in `smie-grammar'.
;; The prec2 tables are only intermediate data structures: the source
;; code normally provides a mix of BNF and precs tables, and then
;; turns them into a levels table, which is what's used by the rest of
;; the SMIE code.

BNF is a list of nonterminal definitions of the form:

Not all grammars are accepted:
- an RHS cannot be an empty list (this is not needed, since SMIE allows all
  non-terminals to match the empty string anyway).
- an RHS cannot have 2 consecutive non-terminals: between each non-terminal
  needs to be a terminal (aka token).  This is a fundamental limitation of
  the parsing technology used (operator precedence grammar).
Additionally, conflicts can occur:
- The returned prec2 table holds constraints between pairs of
  token, and for any given pair only one constraint can be
  present, either: T1 < T2, T1 = T2, or T1 > T2.
- A token can either be an `opener' (something similar to an open-paren),
  a `closer' (like a close-paren), or `neither' of the two (e.g. an infix
  operator, or an inner token like \"else\").
Conflicts can be resolved via RESOLVERS, which is a list of elements that can
be either:
- a precs table (see `smie-precs->prec2') to resolve conflicting constraints,
- a constraint (T1 REL T2) where REL is one of = < or >."

  "Function providing the indentation rules.
It takes two arguments METHOD and ARG where the meaning of ARG
and the expected return value depends on METHOD.
METHOD can be:
- :after, in which case ARG is a token and the function should return the
  OFFSET to use for indentation after ARG.
- :before, in which case ARG is a token and the function should return the
  OFFSET to use to indent ARG itself.
- :elem, in which case the function should return either:
  - the offset to use to indent function arguments (ARG = `arg')
  - the basic indentation step (ARG = `basic').
  - the token to use (when ARG = `empty-line-token') when we don't know how
    to indent an empty line.
- :list-intro, in which case ARG is a token and the function should return
  non-nil if TOKEN is followed by a list of expressions (not separated by any
  token) rather than an expression.
- :close-all, in which case ARG is a close-paren token at indentation and
  the function should return non-nil if it should be aligned with the opener
  of the last close-paren token on the same line, if there are multiple.
  Otherwise, it will be aligned with its own opener.

When ARG is a token, the function is called with point just before that token.
A return value of nil always means to fallback on the default behavior, so the
function should return nil for arguments it does not expect.

OFFSET can be:
nil				use the default indentation rule.
\(column . COLUMN)		indent to column COLUMN.
NUMBER				offset by NUMBER, relative to a base token
				which is the current token for :after and
				its parent for :before.

The functions whose name starts with \"smie-rule-\" are helper functions
designed specifically for use in this function.")

Such a token is expected to have an associative syntax and be closely tied

;; - You can only change a returned offset, so you can't change the offset
;;   passed to smie-rule-parent, nor can you change the object with which
;;   to align (in general).
;; - The rewrite rule can only distinguish cases based on the kind+token arg
;;   and smie-rules-function's return value, so you can't distinguish cases
;;   where smie-rules-function returns the same value.
;; - Since config-rules depend on the return value of smie-rules-function, any
;;   config change that modifies this return value (e.g. changing
;;   foo-indent-basic) ends up invalidating config-rules.
;; This last one is a serious problem since it means that file-local
;; config-rules will only work if the user hasn't changed foo-indent-basic.
;; One possible way to change it is to modify smie-rules-functions so they can
;; return special symbols like +, ++, -, etc.  Or make them use a new
;; smie-rule-basic function which can then be used to know when a returned
;; offset was computed based on foo-indent-basic.
