  "Ask user to select an entry from CHOICES, prompting with PROMPT.
This function allows to ask the user a multiple-choice question.

CHOICES should be a list of the form (KEY NAME [DESCRIPTION]).
KEY is a character the user should type to select the entry.
NAME is a short name for the entry to be displayed while prompting
\(if there's no room, it might be shortened).
DESCRIPTION is an optional longer description of the entry; it will
be displayed in a help buffer if the user requests more help.  This
help description has a fixed format in columns.  For greater
flexibility, instead of passing a DESCRIPTION, the caller can pass
the optional argument HELP-STRING.  This argument is a string that
should contain a more detailed description of all of the possible
choices.  `read-multiple-choice' will display that description in a
help buffer if the user requests that.
If optional argument SHOW-HELP is non-nil, show the help screen
immediately, before any user input.  If SHOW-HELP is a string,
use it as the name of the help buffer.

This function translates user input into responses by consulting
the bindings in `query-replace-map'; see the documentation of
that variable for more information.  The relevant bindings for the
purposes of this function are `recenter', `scroll-up', `scroll-down',
and `edit'.
If the user types the `recenter', `scroll-up', or `scroll-down'
responses, the function performs the requested window recentering or
scrolling, and then asks the question again.  If the user enters `edit',
the function starts a recursive edit.  When the user exit the recursive
edit, the multiple-choice prompt gains focus again.

When `use-dialog-box' is t (the default), and the command using this
function was invoked via the mouse, this function pops up a GUI dialog
to collect the user input, but only if Emacs is capable of using GUI
dialogs.  Otherwise, the function will always use text-mode dialogs.

The return value is the matching entry from the CHOICES list.

If LONG-FORM is non-nil, do a `completing-read' over the NAME elements
in CHOICES instead.  In this case, GUI dialog is not used, regardless
of the value of `use-dialog-box' and whether the function was invoked
via a mouse gesture.

Usage example:

\(read-multiple-choice \"Continue connecting?\"
                      \\='((?a \"always\")
                        (?s \"session only\")
                        (?n \"no\")))"
