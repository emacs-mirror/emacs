;;; Navigation and Text Properties

;; This mode uses the following text properties:
;; backtrace-index: The index into the buffer-local variable
;;   `backtrace-frames' for the frame at point, or nil if outside of a
;;   frame (in the buffer header).
;; backtrace-view: A plist describing how the frame is printed.  See
;;   the docstring for the buffer-local variable `backtrace-view.
;; backtrace-section: The part of a frame which point is in.  Either
;;   `func' or `locals'.  At the moment just used to show and hide the
;;   local variables.  Derived modes which do additional printing
;;   could define their own frame sections.
;; backtrace-form: A value applied to each printed representation of a
;;   top-level s-expression, which needs to be different for sexps
;;   printed adjacent to each other, so the limits can be quickly
;;   found for pretty-printing.

;;; The mode definition

(define-derived-mode backtrace-mode special-mode "Backtrace"
  "Generic major mode for examining an Elisp stack backtrace.
This mode can be used directly, or other major modes can be
derived from it, using `define-derived-mode'.

In this major mode, the buffer contains some optional lines of
header text followed by backtrace frames, each consisting of one
or more whole lines.

Letters in this mode do not insert themselves; instead they are
commands.
\\<backtrace-mode-map>
\\{backtrace-mode-map}

A mode which inherits from Backtrace mode, or a command which
creates a backtrace-mode buffer, should usually do the following:

 - Set `backtrace-revert-hook', if the buffer contents need
   to be specially recomputed prior to `revert-buffer'.
 - Maybe set `backtrace-insert-header-function' to a function to create
   header text for the buffer.
 - Set `backtrace-frames' (see below).
 - Maybe modify `backtrace-view' (see below).
 - Maybe set `backtrace-print-function'.

A command which creates or switches to a Backtrace mode buffer,
such as `ert-results-pop-to-backtrace-for-test-at-point', should
initialize `backtrace-frames' to a list of `backtrace-frame'
objects (`backtrace-get-frames' is provided for that purpose, if
desired), and may optionally modify `backtrace-view', which is a
plist describing the appearance of the backtrace.  Finally, it
should call `backtrace-print'.

`backtrace-print' calls `backtrace-insert-header-function'
followed by `backtrace-print-frame', once for each stack frame."
