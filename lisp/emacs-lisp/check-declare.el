;;; Commentary:

;; The byte-compiler often warns about undefined functions that you
;; know will actually be defined when it matters.  The `declare-function'
;; statement allows you to suppress these warnings.  This package
;; checks that all such statements in a file or directory are accurate.
;; The entry points are `check-declare-file' and `check-declare-directory'.

;; For more information, see Info node `(elisp)Declaring Functions'.

;;; TODO:

;; 1. Warn about functions marked as obsolete, eg
;; password-read-and-add in password-cache.el.
;; 2. defmethod, defclass argument checking.
;; 3. defclass also defines -p and -child-p.

;;; Code:
