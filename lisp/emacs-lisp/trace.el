;;; Commentary:

;; Introduction:
;; =============
;; A simple trace package that utilizes nadvice.el.  It generates trace
;; information in a Lisp-style fashion and inserts it into a trace output
;; buffer.  Tracing can be done in the background (or silently) so that
;; generation of trace output won't interfere with what you are currently
;; doing.

;; Restrictions:
;; =============
;; - Traced subrs when called interactively will always show nil as the
;;   value of their arguments.
;; - Only functions/macros/subrs that are called via their function cell will
;;   generate trace output, hence, you won't get trace output for:
;;   + Subrs called directly from other subrs/C-code
;;   + Compiled calls to subrs that have special byte-codes associated
;;     with them (e.g., car, cdr, ...)
;;   + Macros that were expanded during compilation
;; - All the restrictions that apply to nadvice.el

;; Usage:
;; ======
;; - To trace a function say `M-x trace-function', which will ask you for the
;;   name of the function/subr/macro to trace.
;; - If you want to trace a function that switches buffers or does other
;;   display oriented stuff use `M-x trace-function-background', which will
;;   generate the trace output silently in the background without popping
;;   up windows and doing other irritating stuff.
;; - To untrace a function say `M-x untrace-function'.
;; - To untrace all currently traced functions say `M-x untrace-all'.

;; Examples:
;; =========
;;
;;  (defun fact (n)
;;    (if (= n 0) 1
;;      (* n (fact (1- n)))))
;;  fact
;;
;;  (trace-function 'fact)
;;  fact
;;
;;  Now, evaluating this...
;;
;;  (fact 4)
;;  24
;;
;;  ...will generate the following in *trace-buffer*:
;;
;;  1 -> fact: n=4
;;  | 2 -> fact: n=3
;;  | | 3 -> fact: n=2
;;  | | | 4 -> fact: n=1
;;  | | | | 5 -> fact: n=0
;;  | | | | 5 <- fact: 1
;;  | | | 4 <- fact: 1
;;  | | 3 <- fact: 2
;;  | 2 <- fact: 6
;;  1 <- fact: 24
;;
;;
;;  (defun ack (x y z)
;;    (if (= x 0)
;;        (+ y z)
;;      (if (and (<= x 2) (= z 0))
;;          (1- x)
;;        (if (and (> x 2) (= z 0))
;;            y
;;          (ack (1- x) y (ack x y (1- z)))))))
;;  ack
;;
;;  (trace-function 'ack)
;;  ack
;;
;;  Try this for some interesting trace output:
;;
;;  (ack 3 3 1)
;;  27
;;
;;
;; The following does something similar to the functionality of the package
;; log-message.el by Robert Potter, which is giving you a chance to look at
;; messages that might have whizzed by too quickly (you won't see subr
;; generated messages though):
;;
;; (trace-function-background 'message "*Message Log*")


;;; Change Log:

;; Revision 2.0 1993/05/18 00:41:16 hans
;;	* Adapted for advice.el 2.0; it now also works
;;	  for GNU Emacs-19 and Lemacs
;;	* Separate function `trace-function-background'
;;	* Separate pieces of advice for foreground and background tracing
;;	* Less insane handling of interactive trace buffer specification
;;	* String arguments and values are now printed properly
;;
;; Revision 1.1 1992/12/15 22:45:15 hans
;;	* Created, first public release

Tracing a function causes every call to that function to insert

arguments and return values.  It also evaluates CONTEXT, if that is
non-nil, and inserts its value too.  For example, you can use this
to track the current buffer, or position of point.

This function creates BUFFER if it does not exist.  This buffer will
popup whenever FUNCTION is called.  Do not use this function to trace
functions that switch buffers, or do any other display-oriented
stuff - use `trace-function-background' instead.
