;;; Commentary:

;; This code defines a function, `completing-read-multiple', which
;; provides the ability to read multiple strings in the minibuffer,
;; with completion.  See that function's documentation for details.

;; For the moment, I have decided to not bind any special behavior to
;; the separator key.  In the future, the separator key might be used
;; to provide completion in certain circumstances.  One of the reasons
;; why this functionality is not yet provided is that it is unclear to
;; the author what the precise circumstances are, under which
;; separator-invoked completion should be provided.

;; Design note: `completing-read-multiple' is modeled after
;; `completing-read'.  They should be similar -- it was intentional.

;; Some of this code started out as translation from C code in
;; src/minibuf.c to Emacs Lisp code.  After this code was rewritten in Elisp
;; and made to operate on any field, this file was completely rewritten to
;; just reuse that code.

;; Thanks to Sen Nagata <sen@eccosys.com> for the original version of the
;; code, and sorry for throwing it all out.  --Stef

;; Thanks to Richard Stallman for all of his help (many of the good
;; ideas in here are from him), Gerd Moellmann for his attention,
;; Stefan Monnier for responding with a code sample and comments very
;; early on, and Kai Grossjohann & Soren Dayton for valuable feedback.

;;; Questions and Thoughts:

;; -should `completing-read-multiple' allow a trailing separator in
;; a return value when REQUIRE-MATCH is t?  if not, should beep when a user
;; tries to exit the minibuffer via RET?

;; -tip: use M-f and M-b for ease of navigation among elements.

;; - the difference between minibuffer-completion-table and
;;   crm-completion-table is just crm--collection-fn.  In most cases it
;;   shouldn't make any difference.  But if a non-CRM completion function
;;   happens to be used, it will use minibuffer-completion-table and
;;   crm--collection-fn will try to make it do "more or less the right
;;   thing" by making it complete on the last element, which is about as
;;   good as we can hope for right now.
;;   I'm not sure if it's important or not.  Maybe we could just throw away
;;   crm-completion-table and crm--collection-fn, but there doesn't seem to
;;   be a pressing need for it, and since Sen did bother to write it, we may
;;   as well keep it, in case it helps.
