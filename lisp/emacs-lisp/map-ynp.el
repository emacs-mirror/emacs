;;; Commentary:

;; map-y-or-n-p is a general-purpose question-asking function.
;; It asks a series of y/n questions (a la y-or-n-p), and decides to
;; apply an action to each element of a list based on the answer.
;; The nice thing is that you also get some other possible answers
;; to use, reminiscent of query-replace: ! to answer y to all remaining
;; questions; ESC or q to answer n to all remaining questions; . to answer
;; y once and then n for the remainder; and you can get help with C-h.

;;; Code:

(declare-function x-popup-dialog "menu.c" (position contents &optional header))

(defun map-y-or-n-p (prompter actor list &optional help action-alist
			      no-cursor-in-echo-area)
  "Ask a boolean question per PROMPTER for each object in LIST, then call ACTOR.

LIST is a list of objects, or a function of no arguments to return the next
object; when it returns nil, the list of objects is considered exhausted.

If PROMPTER is a string, it should be a format string to be used to format
the question as \(format PROMPTER OBJECT).
If PROMPTER is not a string, it should be a function of one argument, an
object from LIST, which returns a string to be used as the question for
that object.  If the function's return value is not a string, it may be
nil to ignore the object, or non-nil to act on the object with ACTOR
without asking the user.

ACTOR is a function of one argument, an object from LIST,
which gets called with each object for which the user answers `yes'
to the question presented by PROMPTER.

The user's answers to the questions may be one of the following:

 - y, Y, or SPC to act on that object;
 - n, N, or DEL to skip that object;
 - ! to act on all following objects;
 - ESC or q to exit (skip all following objects);
 - . (period) to act on the current object and then exit; or
 - \\[help-command] to get help.

HELP provides information for displaying help when the user
types \\[help-command].  If HELP is given, it should be a list of
the form (OBJECT OBJECTS ACTION), where OBJECT is a string giving
the singular noun describing an element of LIST; OBJECTS is the
plural noun describing several elements of LIST, and ACTION is a
transitive verb describing action by ACTOR on one or more elements
of LIST.  If HELP is omitted or nil, it defaults
to \(\"object\" \"objects\" \"act on\").

If ACTION-ALIST is given, it is an alist specifying additional keys
that will be accepted as an answer to the questions.  Each element
of the alist has the form (KEY FUNCTION HELP), where KEY is a character;
FUNCTION is a function of one argument (an object from LIST); and HELP
is a string.  When the user presses KEY, FUNCTION is called; if it
returns non-nil, the object is considered to have been \"acted upon\",
and `map-y-or-n-p' proceeds to the next object from LIST.  If
FUNCTION returns nil, the prompt is re-issued for the same object: this
comes in handy if FUNCTION produces some display that will allow the
user to make an intelligent decision whether the object in question
should be acted upon.  If the user types \\[help-command], the string
given by HELP is used to describe the effect of KEY.

Optional argument NO-CURSOR-IN-ECHO-AREA, if non-nil, means not to set
`cursor-in-echo-area' while prompting with the questions.

This function uses `query-replace-map' to define the standard responses,
but only some of the responses which `query-replace' understands
are meaningful here, as described above.

The function's value is the number of actions taken."
