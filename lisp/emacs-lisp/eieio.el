;;; Commentary:
;;
;; EIEIO is a series of Lisp routines which implements a subset of
;; CLOS, the Common Lisp Object System.  In addition, EIEIO also adds
;; a few new features which help it integrate more strongly with the
;; Emacs running environment.
;;
;; See eieio.texi for complete documentation on using this package.
;;
;; Note: the implementation of the c3 algorithm is based on:
;;   Kim Barrett et al.: A Monotonic Superclass Linearization for Dylan
;;   Retrieved from:
;;   http://192.220.96.201/dylan/linearization-oopsla96.html

;; @TODO - fix :initform to be a form, not a quoted value
;; @TODO - Prefix non-clos functions with `eieio-'.

;; TODO: better integrate CL's defstructs and classes.  E.g. make it possible
;; to create a new class that inherits from a struct.

;;; Code:

(defvar eieio-version "1.4"
  "Current version of EIEIO.")

(defun eieio-version ()
  "Display the current version of EIEIO."
  (interactive)
  (message eieio-version))

;;; Defining a new class
;;
(defmacro defclass (name superclasses slots &rest options-and-doc)
  "Define NAME as a new class derived from SUPERCLASS with SLOTS.
OPTIONS-AND-DOC is used as the class' options and base documentation.
SUPERCLASSES is a list of superclasses to inherit from, with SLOTS
being the slots residing in that class definition.  Supported tags are:

  :initform   - Initializing form.
  :initarg    - Tag used during initialization.
  :accessor   - Tag used to create a function to access this slot.
  :allocation - Specify where the value is stored.
                Defaults to `:instance', but could also be `:class'.
  :writer     - A function symbol which will `write' an object's slot.
  :reader     - A function symbol which will `read' an object.
  :type       - The type of data allowed in this slot (see `typep').
  :documentation
              - A string documenting use of this slot.

The following are extensions on CLOS:
  :custom     - When customizing an object, the custom :type.  Public only.
  :label      - A text string label used for a slot when customizing.
  :group      - Name of a customization group this slot belongs in.
  :printer    - A function to call to print the value of a slot.
                See `eieio-override-prin1' as an example.

A class can also have optional options.  These options happen in place
of documentation (including a :documentation tag), in addition to
documentation, or not at all.  Supported options are:

  :documentation - The doc-string used for this class.

Options added to EIEIO:

  :allow-nil-initform - Non-nil to skip typechecking of null initforms.
  :custom-groups      - List of custom group names.  Organizes slots into
                        reasonable groups for customizations.
  :abstract           - Non-nil to prevent instances of this class.
                        If a string, use as an error string if someone does
                        try to make an instance.
  :method-invocation-order
                      - Control the method invocation order if there is
                        multiple inheritance.  Valid values are:
                         :breadth-first - The default.
                         :depth-first

Options in CLOS not supported in EIEIO:

  :metaclass - Class to use in place of `standard-class'
  :default-initargs - Initargs to use when initializing new objects of
                      this class.

Due to the way class options are set up, you can add any tags you wish,
and reference them using the function `class-option'."
