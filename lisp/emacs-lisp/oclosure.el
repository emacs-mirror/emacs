;;; Commentary:

;; An OClosure is an object that combines the properties of records
;; with those of a function.  More specifically it is a function extended
;; with a notion of type (e.g. for defmethod dispatch) as well as the
;; ability to have some fields that are accessible from the outside.

;; See "Open closures", ELS'2022 (https://zenodo.org/record/6228797).

;; Here are some cases of "callable objects" where OClosures have found use:
;; - nadvice.el (the original motivation)
;; - kmacros (for cl-print and for `kmacro-extract-lambda')
;; - cl-generic: turn `cl--generic-isnot-nnm-p' into a mere type test
;;   (by putting the no-next-methods into their own class).
;; - Slot accessor functions, where the type-dispatch can be used to
;;   dynamically compute the docstring, and also to pretty print them.
;; - `save-some-buffers-function'
;; Here are other cases of "callable objects" where OClosures could be used:
;; - Use the type to distinguish macros from functions.
;; - Use a `name' and `depth' property from the function passed to
;;   `add-function' (or `add-hook') instead of passing it via "props".
;; - iterators (generator.el), thunks (thunk.el), streams (stream.el).
;; - PEG rules: they're currently just functions, but they should carry
;;   their original (macro-expanded) definition (and should be printed
;;   differently from functions)!
;; - auto-generate docstrings for cl-defstruct slot accessors instead of
;;   storing them in the accessor itself?
;; - SRFI-17's `setter'.
;; - coercion wrappers, as in "Threesomes, with and without blame"
;;   https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/1706299.1706342, or
;;   "On the Runtime Complexity of Type-Directed Unboxing"
;;   http://sv.c.titech.ac.jp/minamide/papers.html
;; - An efficient `negate' operation such that
;;   (negate (negate f)) returns just `f' and (negate #'<) returns #'>=.
;; - Autoloads (tho currently our bytecode functions (and hence OClosures)
;;   are too fat for that).

;; Related constructs:
;; - `funcallable-standard-object' (FSO) in Common-Lisp.  These are different
;;   from OClosures in that they involve an additional indirection to get
;;   to the actual code, and that they offer the possibility of
;;   changing (via mutation) the code associated with
;;   an FSO.  Also the FSO's function can't directly access the FSO's
;;   other fields, contrary to the case with OClosures where those are directly
;;   available as local variables.
;; - Function objects in Javascript.
;; - Function objects in Python.
;; - Callable/Applicable classes in OO languages, i.e. classes with
;;   a single method called `apply' or `call'.  The most obvious
;;   difference with OClosures (beside the fact that Callable can be
;;   extended with additional methods) is that all instances of
;;   a given Callable class have to use the same method, whereas every
;;   OClosure object comes with its own code, so two OClosure objects of the
;;   same type can have different code.  Of course, you can get the
;;   same result by turning every `oclosure-lambda' into its own class
;;   declaration creating an ad-hoc subclass of the specified type.
;;   In this sense, OClosures are just a generalization of `lambda' which brings
;;   some of the extra feature of Callable objects.
;; - Apply hooks and "entities" in MIT Scheme
;;   https://www.gnu.org/software/mit-scheme/documentation/stable/mit-scheme-ref/Application-Hooks.html
;;   Apply hooks are basically the same as Common-Lisp's FSOs, and "entities"
;;   are a variant of it where the inner function gets the FSO itself as
;;   additional argument (a kind of "self" arg), thus making it easier
;;   for the code to get data from the object's extra info, tho still
;;   not as easy as with OClosures.
;; - "entities" in Lisp Machine Lisp (LML)
;;   https://hanshuebner.github.io/lmman/fd-clo.xml
;;   These are arguably identical to OClosures, modulo the fact that LML doesn't
;;   have lexically-scoped closures and uses a form of closures based on
;;   capturing (and reinstating) dynamically scoped bindings instead.

;; Naming: OClosures were originally named FunCallableRecords (FCR), but
;; that name suggested these were fundamentally records that happened
;; to be called, whereas OClosures are really just closures that happen
;; to enjoy some characteristics of records.
;; The "O" comes from "Open" because OClosures aren't completely opaque
;; (for that same reason, an alternative name suggested at the time was
;; "disclosures").
;; The "O" can also be understood to mean "Object" since you have notions
;; of inheritance, and the ability to associate methods with particular
;; OClosure types, just as is the case for OO classes.

;;; Code:

;; TODO:
;; - `oclosure-(cl-)defun', `oclosure-(cl-)defsubst', `oclosure-define-inline'?
;; - Use accessor in cl-defstruct.
;; - Add pcase patterns for OClosures.
;; - anonymous OClosure types.
;; - copiers for mixins
;; - class-allocated slots?
;; - code-allocated slots?
;;   The `where' slot of `advice' would like to be code-allocated, and the
;;   interactive-spec of commands is currently code-allocated but would like
;;   to be instance-allocated.  Their scoping rules are a bit odd, so maybe
;;   it's best to avoid them.
