  "Used for folding characters of the same group during search.
This is a char-table with the `char-fold-table' subtype.

Let us refer to the character in question by char-x.
Each entry is either nil (meaning char-x only matches literally)
or a regexp.  This regexp should match anything that char-x can
match by itself \(including char-x).  For instance, the default
regexp for the ?+ character is \"[+⁺₊﬩﹢＋]\".

This table also has one extra slot which is also a char-table.
Each entry in the extra slot is an alist used for multi-character
matching (which may be nil).  The elements of the alist should
have the form (SUFFIX . OTHER-REGEXP).  If the characters after
char-x are equal to SUFFIX, then this combination of char-x +
SUFFIX is allowed to match OTHER-REGEXP.  This is in addition to
char-x being allowed to match REGEXP.
For instance, the default alist for ?f includes:
    \((\"fl\" . \"ﬄ\") (\"fi\" . \"ﬃ\")
     (\"i\" . \"ﬁ\") (\"f\" . \"ﬀ\"))

Exceptionally for the space character (32), ALIST is ignored.")
