# EmacsMoe Patchset

The original README is `README.emacs`.

This patchset tries to introduce modern visual effects to Emacs.  Like
them or not, implementing them is a fun weekend project.

## Help wanted!

1. As you know, Emacs supports a variety of GUI platforms.  I'm familiar
   with none of them!  Right now, I have only Linux and macOS
   environments, so at least someone with Windows expertise is wanted.
2. There may be design flaws.  Please don't hesitate to bring forth
   your idea.

## Implemented features

Nothing so far.
