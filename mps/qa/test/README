This is release una of the MMQA test harness.

To use, run the perl script 'qa' in this directory (this
may involve typing 'qa' or 'perl qa', depending on your setup).

The qa commands 'index' and 'help' require globbing to work
in your version of perl. On some PCs it doesn't, so unfortunately
you won't be able to use these commands. Try browsing the directory
script/help instead. I will try to fix this in the next release.

This test harness has itself undergone no formal QA process.
