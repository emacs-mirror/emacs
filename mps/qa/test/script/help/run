run tests, reporting results and verdict
% $HopeName: MMQA_harness!script:help:run(trunk.2) $

Usage: qa run [<options>] <testfile> [<testfile> ...]

'run' runs tests individually. The test libraries must previously
have been compiled with 'clib'.

'run' shows the test's output as it runs, then when it finishes,
displays test information, results, and the verdict: PASS or FAIL.
