Numbering of test programs

Test programs are identified by codes consisting of a single letter
and some numbers (no leading zeros). The letter gives the type
of test, and where to find it, as follows: 

  f --  Functional test        MMQA_test_function
  a --  Argument violation     MMQA_test_argerr
  c --  Context violation      MMQA_test_conerr
  t -- aTtribute test          MMQA_test_attribute
  m --  Miscellaneous test     MMQA_test_misc

Every program is classified as one of these, and for each there is
a directory, as given above. In the directory, nn.c are the
test files, numbered in decimal from 0, and index is a text
file giving short summaries of what the tests test.

When citing a test in a bug report, Darwin request or other
documentation, give its code as, e.g. 'f5'.
