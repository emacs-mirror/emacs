Numbering of test programs

Test program are indentified by their hope names, i.e. by a hope
compound, an exclamation mark, and the test file name. The test
file name will usually be a number followed by .c.

e.g. test 12.c in directory 'function' is MMQA_test_function!12.c.

-------

Some older documents may refer to test programs by codes consisting
of a single letter and some numbers (no leading zeros). The letter
gives the type of test, and where to find it, as follows: 

  f --  Functional test        MMQA_test_function
  a --  Argument violation     MMQA_test_argerr
  c --  Context violation      MMQA_test_conerr
  m --  Miscellaneous test     MMQA_test_misc

Please do not use this naming system any more.
