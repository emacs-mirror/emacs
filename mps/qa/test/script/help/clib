compile test libraries
% $HopeName: MMQA_harness!script:help:clib(trunk.2) $

Usage: qa clib [-i MMQA_MPS_INCLUDE_DIR] [-v MMQA_INTERFACE_VERSION]

'clib' recompiles the test libraries (as listed in testlib:manifest)
You must run clib before running tests with 'run', and you are
advised to run it when switching from one memory manager to another.

Compiled libraries are placed in the obj:<platform>: directory.
