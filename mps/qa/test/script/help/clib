compile test libraries

Usage: qa clib [-i MMQA_MPS_INCLUDE_DIR] [-v MMQA_INTERFACE_VERSION]

'clib' recompiles the test libraries (as listed in testlib:manifest)
You must run clib before running tests with 'try' or 'run', and you
are advised to run it when switching from one memory manager to
another.

Compiled libraries are placed in the obj:<platform>: directory.
