display options and their current values
% $HopeName: MMQA_harness!script:help:options(trunk.4) $

Usage: qa options [<options>]

'options' prints out a table of all options and flags used
by the qa harness. Each may be specified by setting an
environment variable (to "on" or "off" in the case of a flag)
or as a command line option. The current values (i.e. resulting
from defaults, environment variables and any options given
to the 'options' command) are also shown. You can use command-
line options with the 'options' command to check that you're
specifying them correctly, but of course they won't remain
set for future commands.

In general, if you specify a command-line option or flag, it
will override whatever setting was made with environment variables.
If the option is _cumulative_, however, both will apply.

What the options mean:

MMQA_MPS_INCLUDE_DIR / -i
 a directory where the MM header files may be found. No default.
 Note: if you change this setting, it may be necessary to recompile
 the test libraries (qa clib).

MMQA_MPS_LINK_OBJ / -l
 the MM libraries and plinth to link with. Separate multiple files
 with spaces. No default.
 Note: if you change this setting, it may be necessary to recompile
 the test libraries (qa clib), because if may change the value of
 MMQA_MPS_PRODUCT.

MMQA_MPS_PRODUCT / -prod
 Should be "epcore" or "dylan", according to which memory manager
 you are testing. The only difference this makes is whether the
 test harness uses the trampoline or not. Usually you will not need
 to set this option, as if it is left unset, the harness will use
 MPS version identification to choose the right value.
 Note: if you change this setting, it may be necessary to recompile
 the test libraries (qa clib).

MMQA_MPS_INTERFACE_VERSION / -v
 It should be one of the following:

  OS (oldstyle)  release.dylan.incr.patch.11
  MO (modern)    release.mps.thursdaypm
  GR (grotesque) release.dylan.honeybee   ("space"->"arena")
  BQ (baroque)   release.dylan.meadowlark (needs mpsw3.h)
  HU (humanist)  release.dylan.kinglet    (spare committed fund)

 These are in order from oldest to newest, so e.g. GR is appropriate
 for releases from honeybee upto but not including meadowlark. If
 you just want to test a build from the trunk or a development
 branch then it's anybody's guess what version you should use, if
 indeed there is an appropriate one. This situation won't improve
 until the MPS has an interface-version-interface -- then it can
 all be automated.

 The default is the most recent version. New interface versions
 are added (by rit) when he discovers that the MM interface has changed
 so as to require them.

 If you change this setting, it is necessary to recompile the
 test libraries (qa clib).

MMQA_LOG_DIR / -g
 the directory in which log files should be saved. Default is
 'log' directory inside the MMQA 'test' directory.

MMQA_DATA_DIR / -data
 the diretory in which MMQA data files may be found. Default is
 '../data' from the MMQA 'test' directory. This is used when tests
 specify a particular file as their standard input. If you specify
 the standard input with MMQA_STDIN, the current directory is used.

MMQA_PLATFORM / -p
 the platform you are running on. This is determined automatically,
 and used to specify compiler options and command-line syntax for
 running tests. Setting it to a value not appropriate to the
 machine you are using will make the test system go wrong.

MMQA_PARAMETERS / -a (cumulative)
 parameter settings to use for a test. These override any parameter
 settings specified in the test header. Examples (all equivalent):

 1) qa run test.c -a DEPTH=10 -a WIDTH=5

 2) qa run test.c -a "WIDTH=5 DEPTH=10"
 
 3) MMQA_PARAMETERS='DEPTH=10 WIDTH=5'
    qa run test.c

 4) MMQA_PARAMETERS='DEPTH=10'
    qa run test.c -a WIDTH=5

 Parameters may also be specified individually:

 5) MMQA_PARAM_DEPTH=10
    MMQA_PARAM_WIDTH=5
    qa run test.c

 All these kinds of parameter settings may be combined. In the case
 of a clash, the command-line setting takes precedence, then the
 setting via MMQA_PARAMETERS. I recommend using command-line settings
 only, otherwise there's a risk you'll leave the parameters set and
 end up using them by mistake with other tests.

MMQA_STDIN / -s
 allows you to specify what a test will use for its standard
 input. If unset, the file specified by the test itself will
 be used (from the MMQA_DATA_DIR directory). By setting MMQA_STDIN,
 you can use a file of your choosing, or specify "STDIN" if you want
 to force input from whatever is the qa harness's standard input
 (usually the keyboard).

MMQA_DEBUG_INFO / -[no]debug
 default is 'off'. If you turn this on, qa commands will output
 various diagnostic messages, which may or may not be useful in
 the event of a problem with the test system. Not recommended.
