display options and their current values

Usage: qa options [<options>]

'options' prints out a table of all options and flags used
by the qa harness. Each may be specified by setting an
environment variable (to "on" or "off" in the case of a flag)
or as a command line option. The current values (i.e. resulting
from defaults, environment variables and any options given
to the 'options' command) are also shown.

What the options mean:

MMQA_MPS_INCLUDE_DIR
 a directory where the MM header files may be found.

MMQA_MPS_LINK_OBJ
 the MM libraries (and any other necessary files, eg the
 plinth) that must be linked.

MMQA_INTERFACE_VERSION
 the version of the MM interface to use. Default is
 GR (grotesque), which should be correct for honeybee.3 and later
 releases to Dylan. Older interfaces were known as MO (modern) and
 OS (oldstyle). For testing the MM as supplied to Scriptworks,
 use version SW (this does not try to use the trampoline, as it
 doesn't seem to be supported in the mmsw library.
 Note: if you change this setting, it may be necessary to recompile
 the test libraries (qa clib).

MMQA_LOG_DIR
 the directory in which log files should be saved.
