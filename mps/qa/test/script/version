# Version history:
# [Recorded history begins with version 2.0]
#
#  2.0 -- First numbered harness version. Before this tests didn't
#         know what they required.
#  2.1 -- Addition of interface version HU. 1999-02-17
#  2.2 -- Option display no longer prints "MMQA_" before each, as
#         first column was getting too narrow for option names
