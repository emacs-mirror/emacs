$HARNESS_VERSION="3.0";

# Version history:
# [Recorded history begins with version 2.0]
#
#  2.0 -- First numbered harness version. Before this tests didn't
#         know what they required.
#  2.1 -- Addition of interface version HU. 1999-02-17
#  2.2 -- Option display no longer prints "MMQA_" before each, as
#         first column was getting too narrow for option names.
#  2.3 -- Changed link settings on Intel NT, to link with MSVCRT and not
#         any other defaultlib.
#  2.4 -- Changed to use "/usr/lib/sendmail" on unix platforms.
#         Made easy_tramp2 static.
#         Added mmqa_arena_create function.
#  2.5 -- Added quoting for -Dparm=value options to compiler. Needed
#         because some tests have e.g. value = (size_t)1024.
#  2.6 -- "qa help install" added, after drj asked for it
#
#  3.0 -- scrutinize MPS header files, extracting symbols. Record settings
#         and other info at time of clib, and check before running tests.
#         INTERFACE_VERSION removed. DANGEROUS added. 1999-05-04
