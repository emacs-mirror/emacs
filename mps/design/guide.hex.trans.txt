1. Introduction
---------------

_`.scope`: This document explains how to represent the alphabet as hexadecimal 
digits.

_`.readership`: This document is intended for anyone devising arbitrary constants 
which may appear in hex-dumps.

_`.sources`: This transliteration was supplied by RichardK in 
mail.richardk.1997-04-07.13-44.


2. Transliteration
------------------

_`.forward`: The chosen transliteration is as follows::

    ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
    ABCDEF9811C7340BC6520F3812

_`.backward`: The backwards transliteration is as follows::

    0 OU
    1 IJY
    2 TZ
    3 MW
    4 N
    5 S
    6 R
    7 L
    8 HX
    9 G
    A A
    B BP
    C CKQ
    D D
    E E
    F FV

_`.pad`: If padding is required (to fill a hex constant length), you should use 
9's, because G is rare and can usually be inferred from context.

_`.punc`: There is no formal scheme for spaces, or punctuation.  It is suggested 
that you use 9 (as `.pad`_).


3. Justification
----------------

_`.letters`: The hexadecimal letters (A-F) are all formed by similarity of sound.  
B and P sound similar, as do F and V, and C, K, & Q can all sound similar.

_`.numbers`: The numbers (0-9) are all formed by similarity of shape (but see 
`.trans.t`_).  Nevertheless, 1=IJY retains some similarity of sound.

_`.trans.t`: T is an exception to `.numbers`_, but is such a common letter that it 
deserves it.


4. Notes
--------

_`.change`: This transliteration differs from the old transliteration used for 
signatures (see design.mps.sig(0)), as follows: J:6->1; L:1->7; N:9->4; R:4->6; 
W:8->3; X:5->8; Y:E->I.

_`.problem.mw`: There is a known problem that M and W are both common, map to the 
same digit (3), and are hard to distinguish in context.

_`.find.c`: It is possible to find all 8-digit hexadecimal constants and how many 
times they're used in C files, using the following Perl script::

    perl5 -n -e 'BEGIN { %C=(); } if(/0x([0-9A-Fa-f]{8})/) { $C{$1} = +[] if(
    !defined($C{$1})); push(@{$C{$1}}, $ARGV); } END { foreach $H (sort(keys(%C)))
    { printf "%3d %s %s\n", scalar(@{$C{$H}}), $H, join(", ", @{@C{$H}}); } }' *.c
    *.h

_`.comment`: It is a good idea to add a comment to any constant declaration 
indicating the English version and which letters were selected (by 
capitalisation), e.g.::

    #define SpaceSig        ((Sig)0x5195BACE) /* SIGnature SPACE */
