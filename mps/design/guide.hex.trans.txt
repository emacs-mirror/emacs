Introduction
------------

_`.scope`: This document explains how to represent the alphabet as
hexadecimal digits.

_`.readership`: This document is intended for anyone devising
arbitrary constants which may appear in hex-dumps.

_`.sources`: This transliteration was supplied by RichardK in
mail.richardk.1997-04-07.13-44.


Transliteration
---------------

_`.forward`: The chosen transliteration is as follows::

    ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
    ABCDEF9811C7340BC6520F3812

_`.backward`: The backwards transliteration is as follows::

    0 OU
    1 IJY
    2 TZ
    3 MW
    4 N
    5 S
    6 R
    7 L
    8 HX
    9 G
    A A
    B BP
    C CKQ
    D D
    E E
    F FV

_`.pad`: If padding is required (to fill a hex constant length), you
should use 9's, because G is rare and can usually be inferred from
context.

_`.punc`: There is no formal scheme for spaces, or punctuation. It is
suggested that you use 9 (as `.pad`_).


Justification
--------------

_`.letters`: The hexadecimal letters (A-F) are all formed by
similarity of sound. B and P sound similar, as do F and V, and C, K, &
Q can all sound similar.

_`.numbers`: The numbers (0-9) are all formed by similarity of shape
(but see `.trans.t`_). Nevertheless, 1=IJY retains some similarity of
sound.

_`.trans.t`: T is an exception to `.numbers`_, but is such a common
letter that it deserves it.


4. Notes
--------

_`.change`: This transliteration differs from the old transliteration
used for signatures (see design.mps.sig(0)), as follows: J:6->1;
L:1->7; N:9->4; R:4->6; W:8->3; X:5->8; Y:E->I.

_`.problem.mw`: There is a known problem that M and W are both common,
map to the same digit (3), and are hard to distinguish in context.

_`.find.c`: It is possible to find all 8-digit hexadecimal constants
and how many times they're used in C files, using the following Perl
script::

    perl5 -n -e 'BEGIN { %C=(); } if(/0x([0-9A-Fa-f]{8})/) { $C{$1} = +[] if(
    !defined($C{$1})); push(@{$C{$1}}, $ARGV); } END { foreach $H (sort(keys(%C)))
    { printf "%3d %s %s\n", scalar(@{$C{$H}}), $H, join(", ", @{@C{$H}}); } }' *.c
    *.h

_`.comment`: It is a good idea to add a comment to any constant
declaration indicating the English version and which letters were
selected (by capitalisation), e.g.::

    #define SpaceSig        ((Sig)0x5195BACE) /* SIGnature SPACE */
