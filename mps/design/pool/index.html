            THE DESIGN OF THE POOL AND POOL CLASS MECHANISMS
                            design.mps.pool
                             incomplete doc

- This document must derive the requirements for pool.c etc. from the 
architecture.



<a id="def.outer-structure" name="def.outer-structure">.def.outer-structure</a>: The "outer structure" (of a pool) is a C object of type 
PoolXXXStruct or the type struct PoolXXXStruct itself.
<a id="def.generic-structure" name="def.generic-structure">.def.generic-structure</a>: The "generic structure" is a C object of type 
PoolStruct (found embedded in the outer-structure) or the type struct 
PoolStruct itself.

<a id="align" name="align">.align</a>: When initialised, the pool gets the default alignment (ARCH_ALIGN).

<a id="no" name="no">.no</a>: If a pool class doesn't implement a method, and doesn't expect it to be 
called, it should use a non-method (PoolNo*) which will cause an assertion 
failure if they are reached. 

<a id="triv" name="triv">.triv</a>: If a pool class supports a protocol but does not require any more than a 
trivial implementation, it should use a trivial method (PoolTriv*) which will 
do the trivial thing.

<a id="outer-structure.sig" name="outer-structure.sig">.outer-structure.sig</a>: It is good practice to put the signature for the outer 
structure at the end (of the structure).  This is because there's already one 
at the beginning (in the poolStruct) so putting it at the end gives some extra 
fencepost checking.

REQUIREMENTS

<a id="req.fix" name="req.fix">.req.fix</a>: PoolFix must be fast.
