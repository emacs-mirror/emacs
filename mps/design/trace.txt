Introduction
------------

.. warning::

    This document is currently a mixture of very old design notes (the
    preformatted section immediately following) and some newer stuff.
    It doesn't yet form anything like a complete picture.


Architecture
------------

_`.instance.limit`: There will be a limit on the number of traces that
can be created at any one time. This effectively limits the number of
concurrent traces. This limitation is expressed in the symbol
``TRACE_MAX``.

.. note::

    ``TRACE_MAX`` is currently set to 1, see request.mps.160020
    "Multiple traces would not work". David Jones, 1998-06-15.

_`.rate`: See `mail.nickb.1997-07-31.14-37 </project/mps/mail/1997/07/31/14-37/0.txt>`_.

.. note::

    Now revised? See request.epcore.160062 and
    change.epcore.minnow.160062. David Jones, 1998-06-15.

_`.exact.legal`: Exact references should either point outside the
arena (to non-managed address space) or to a tract allocated to a
pool. Exact references that are to addresses which the arena has
reserved but hasn't allocated memory to are illegal (the exact
reference couldn't possibly refer to a real object). Depending on the
future semantics of ``PoolDestroy()`` we might need to adjust our
strategy here. See mail.dsm.1996-02-14.18-18 for a strategy of coping
gracefully with ``PoolDestroy()``. We check that this is the case in the
fixer. It may be sensible to make this check CRITICAL in certain
configurations.

_`.fix.fixed.all`: ``ss->fixedSummary`` is accumulated (in the fixer)
for all the pointers whether or not they are genuine references. We
could accumulate fewer pointers here; if a pointer fails the
``TractOfAddr()`` test then we know it isn't a reference, so we needn't
accumulate it into the fixed summary. The design allows this, but it
breaks a useful post-condition on scanning (if the accumulation of
``ss->fixedSummary`` was moved the accuracy of ``ss->fixedSummary``
would vary according to the "width" of the white summary). See
mail.pekka.1998-02-04.16-48 for improvement suggestions.


Analysis
--------

_`.fix.copy-fail`: Fixing can always succeed, even if copying the
referenced object has failed (due to lack of memory, for example), by
backing off to treating a reference as ambiguous. Assuming that fixing
an ambiguous reference doesn't allocate memory (which is no longer
true for AMC for example). See request.dylan.170560 for a slightly
more sophisticated way to proceed when you can no longer allocate
memory for copying.


Ideas
-----

_`.flip.after`: To avoid excessive barrier impact on the mutator
immediately after flip, we could scan during flip other objects which
are "near" the roots, or otherwise known to be likely to be accessed
in the near future.


Implementation
--------------

Speed
.....

_`.fix`: The fix path is critical to garbage collection speed.
Abstractly fix is applied to all the references in the non-white heap
and all the references in the copied heap. Remembered sets cut down
the number of segments we have to scan. The zone test cuts down the
number of references we call fix on. The speed of the remainder of the
fix path is still critical to system performance. Various
modifications to and aspects of the system are concerned with
maintaining the speed along this path.

_`.fix.tractofaddr`: ``TractOfAddr()`` is called on every reference that
passes the zone test and is on the critical path, to determine whether
the segment is white. There is no need to examine the segment to
perform this test, since whiteness information is duplicated in
tracts, specifically to optimize this test. ``TractOfAddr()`` itself is
a simple class dispatch function (which dispatches to the arena
class's ``TractOfAddr()`` method). Inlining the dispatch and inlining
the functions called by ``VMTractOfAddr()`` makes a small but noticable
difference to the speed of the dylan compiler.

_`.fix.noaver`: ``AVER()`` statements in the code add bulk to the code
(reducing I-cache efficacy) and add branches to the path (polluting
the branch pedictors) resulting in a slow down. Removing all the
``AVER()`` statements from the fix path improves the overall speed of
the Dylan compiler by as much as 9%.

_`.fix.nocopy`: ``AMCFix()`` used to copy objects by using the format's
copy method. This involved a function call (through an indirection)
and in ``dylan_copy`` a call to ``dylan_skip`` (to recompute the
length) and call to ``memcpy`` with general parameters. Replacing this
with a direct call to ``memcpy`` removes these overheads and the call
to ``memcpy`` now has aligned parameters. The call to ``memcpy`` is
inlined by the C compiler. This change results in a 4–5% speed-up in
the Dylan compiler.

_`.reclaim`: Because the reclaim phase of the trace (implemented by
``TraceReclaim()``) examines every segment it is fairly time intensive.
rit's profiles presented in request.dylan.170551 show a gap between
the two varieties variety.hi and variety.wi.

_`.reclaim.noaver`: Converting ``AVER()`` statements in the loops of
``TraceReclaim()``, ``PoolReclaim()``, ``AMCReclaim()`` (``LOReclaim()``?
``AWLReclaim()``?) will result in a noticeable speed improvement.

.. note::

    Insert actual speed improvement here, if any.


Life cycle of a trace object
----------------------------

``TraceCreate()`` creates a trace in state ``TraceINIT``

Some segments get condemned (made white).

``TraceStart()`` gets called which:

- Derives an initial reference partition based on the existing
  white set.  The white zone set and the segments' summaries are used to
  create an initial grey set.

- Emits a ``GCStart()`` message.

- Initialises ``trace->rate`` by estimating the required scanning
  rate.

- Moves the trace into the state ``TraceUNFLIPPED``.

- Immediately calls ``traceFlip`` which flips the trace and moves
  it into state ``TraceFLIPPED``.

Whilst a trace is alive every so often its ``traceQuantum`` method
gets invoked (via ``TracePoll()``) in order to do a quantum of tracing
work. ``traceQuantum`` is responsible for ticking through the trace's
top-level state machine. Most of the interesting work, the tracing,
happens in the ``TraceFLIPPED`` state.

The trace transitions through its states in the following sequence:
``TraceINIT`` → (``TraceUNFLIPPED``) → ``TraceFLIPPED`` →
``TraceRECLAIM`` → ``TraceFINISHED``.

Whilst ``TraceUNFLIPPED`` appears in the code, no trace does any work
in this state; all traces are immediately flipped to be in the
``TraceFLIPPED`` state (see above).

Once the trace is in the ``TraceFINISHED`` state it performs no more
work and it can be safely destroyed. Generally the callers of
``traceQuantum`` will destroy the trace.


Making progress: scanning grey segments
.......................................

Most of the interesting work of a trace, the actual tracing, happens
in the ``TraceFLIPPED`` state (work *would* happen in the
``TraceUNFLIPPED`` state, but that is not implemented).

The tracer makes progress by choosing a grey segment to scan, and
scanning it. The actual scanning is performed by pools.

Note that at all times a reference partition is maintained.

The order in which the trace scans things determines the semantics of
certain types of references (in particular, weak and final
references). Or, to put it another way the desired semantics of weak
and final references impose certain restrictions on the order in which
the trace can scan things.

The tracer uses a system of *reference ranks* (or just ranks) so that
it can impose an order on its scanning work. The ranks are ordered.

The tracer proceeds band by band. The first band is all objects it can
reach by following references of the first rank. The second band is
all subsequent objects it can reach by following references of the
second and first ranks. The third band is all subsequent objects it
can reach by following references of the third, second, and first
ranks. And so on. The description of the tracer working like this
originated in [RHSK_2007-06-25]_.

A trace keep track of which band it is tracing. This is returned by
the ``TraceBand()`` method. Keeping this band information helps it
implement the semantics of finalization and weakness. The band used to
not be explicitly stored, but this hindered the implementation of good
finalization semantics (essentially in some circumstances finalization
messages were delayed by at least one collection cycle, see
job001658_.

.. _job001658: https://info.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/issue/job001658/

The band is used when selecting a grey segment to scan (the selection
occurs in ``traceFindGrey()``). The tracer attempts to first find
segments whose rank is the current band, then segments whose rank is
previous to the current band, and so on. If there are no segments
found then the current band is exhausted and the current band is
incremented to the next rank. When the current band is moved through
all the ranks in this fashion there is no more tracing to be done.
