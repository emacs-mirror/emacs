Introduction
------------

_`.intro`: This document describes the ``WriteF`` function, which
allows formatted output in a manner similar to ANSI C ``printf``, but
allows the MPM to operate in a freestanding environment (see
design.mps.exec-env).

_`.background`: The documents design.mps.exec-env and design.mps.lib
describe the design of the library interface and the reason that it
exists.


Design
------

_`.no-printf`: There is no dependency on ``printf``. The MPM only
depends on ``fputc`` and ``fputs``, via the Library Interface
(design.mps.lib). This makes it much easier to deploy the MPS in a
freestanding environment. This is achieved by implementing our own
internal output routines in mpm.c.

Our output requirements are few, so the code is short. The only output
function which should be used in the rest of the MPM is ``WriteF``,
which is similar to ``fprintf``:

``Res WriteF(mps_lib_FILE *stream, ...)``

``WriteF`` expects a format string followed by zero or more items to
insert into the output, followed by another format string, more items,
and so on, and finally a ``NULL`` format string. For example::

    WriteF(stream,
           "Hello: $A\n", address,
           "Spong: $U ($S)\n", number, string,
           NULL);

This makes ``Describe`` methods much easier to write. For example, ``BufferDescribe`` might contain the following code::

    WriteF(stream,
           "Buffer $P ($U) {\n", (WriteFP)buffer, (WriteFU)buffer->serial,
           "  base $A  init $A  alloc $A  limit $A\n",
           (WriteFA)buffer->base, (WriteFA)buffer->ap.init, 
           (WriteFA)buffer->ap.alloc, (WriteFA)buffer->ap.limit,
           "  Pool $P\n",        (WriteFP)buffer->pool,
           "  Seg $P\n",         (WriteFP)buffer->seg,
           "  rank $U\n",        (WriteFU)buffer->rank,
           "  alignment $W\n",   (WriteFW)buffer->alignment,
           "  grey $B\n",        (WriteFB)buffer->grey,
           "  shieldMode $B\n",  (WriteFB)buffer->shieldMode,
           "  p $P  i $U\n",     (WriteFP)buffer->p, (WriteFU)buffer->i,
           "} Buffer $P ($U)\n", (WriteFP)buffer, (WriteFU)buffer->serial,
           NULL);

_`.types`: For each format ``$X`` that ``WriteF`` supports, there is a
type defined in impl.h.mpmtypes ``WriteFX`` which is the promoted
version of that type. These are provided both to ensure promotion and
to avoid any confusion about what type should be used in a cast. It is
easy to check the casts against the formats to ensure that they
correspond.

_`.types.future`: It is possibly that this type set or similar may be
used in future in some generalisation of varargs in the MPS.

_`.formats`: The formats supported are as follows.

======= =========== =============== ======================================
Code    Bame        Type            Example rendering
======= =========== =============== ======================================
``$A``  address     ``Addr``        ``000000019EF60010``
``$P``  pointer     ``void *``      ``000000019EF60100``
``$F``  function    ``void *(*)()`` ``000000019EF60100``
``$S``  string      ``char *``      ``hello``
``$C``  character   ``char``        ``x``
``$W``  word        ``ULongest``    ``0000000000109AE0``
``$U``  decimal     ``ULongest``    ``42``
``$B``  binary      ``ULongest``    ``00000000000000001011011110010001``
``$$``  dollar      --              ``$``
======= =========== =============== ======================================

Note that ``WriteFC`` is an ``int``, because that is the default
promotion of a ``char`` (see `.types`_).

_`.snazzy`: We should resist the temptation to make ``WriteF`` an
incredible snazzy output engine. We only need it for ``Describe``
methods and assertion messages. At the moment it's a very simple bit
of code -- let's keep it that way.

_`.f`: The ``F`` code is used for function pointers. They are
currently printed as a hexadecimal string of the appropriate length
for the platform, and may one day be extended to include function name
lookup.
