Introduction
------------

_`.intro`: This is the design of the documentation system for the
Memory Pool System.

_`.readership`: This document is intended for any MPS developer.


Types
-----

_`.type`: The MPS has multiple types of documentation, suitable for
different audiences.

_`.type.comment`: Comments in the code provide information that is
required in order for developers to make correct edits to nearby code.
(Audience: MPS developers editing nearby code.)

_`.type.design`: Design documentation lists requirements and explains
how the code meets the requirements. (Audience: MPS developers working
on a subsystem.)

_`.type.devguide`: Developer guides provide general guidance for
developers, not specific to any particular subsystem. (Audience: MPS
developers generally.)

_`.type.procedure`: Procedures list the steps for carrying out
development tasks. (Audience: MPS developers who need to carry out
particular tasks reliably.)

_`.type.tutorial`: Tutorials describe how to use the MPS to meet
client program requirements. (Audience: beginner client program
developers.)

_`.type.reference`: Reference documentation specifies the public
features of the MPS. (Audience: expert client program developers.)

_`.type.mmref`: The Memory Management Reference describes general
principles of memory management, with cross-references to the MPS
documentation. (Audience: the world.)


Requirements
------------

_`.req.source`: Derived from [RB_2013-05-09]_.

_`.req.easy`: It must be easy to read and write documentation must
using standard text editors. Barriers to documentation must be low.

_`.req.presentation`: It must be possible to process documentation
into presentation formats, for example web pages.

_`.req.single-source`: Documents must have a single source. Processing
into other formats must be automatic and not depend on hand editing or
maintaining parallel versions.

_`.req.durable`: The format of documents should be supported for the
foreseeable future. It must not require continual updating to keep up
with changes to processing software.

_`.req.design.ref`: It must be easy to reference points made in design
documents from the code.

_`.req.design.standalone`: Design documents must stand alone: they
must not require particular software to make them readable or
complete.
