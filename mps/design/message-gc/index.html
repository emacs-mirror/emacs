<h2><a id="section-1" name="section-1">1. Introduction</a></h2>

<p> This document describes the design of a set of
<a href="../message/">MPS message</a> classes.  The messages from these
classes are emitted according to various important phases in a GC cycle;
collectively they are called GC Messages. </p>

<p> The current classes are: </p>

<dl>

  <dt> <p> mps_message_type_gc_start() </p> </dt>

  <dd> <p> (new in gcgenmsg branch) These messages are generated once per GC at the start of a
  GC. </p> </dd>

  <dt> <p> mps_message_type_gc() </p> </dt>

  <dd> <p> These messages are generated once per GC at the end of a GC. </p> </dd>

  <dt> <p> mps_message_type_gc_generation() </p> </dt>

  <dd> <p> (new in gcgenmsg branch) These messages are generated once
  per generation per GC. A single such message explains how a generation
  intends to participate in the collection. They are useful to experts
  and interesting to other parties. </p> </dd>

</dl>

<p> The intended readership is project staff. </p>

<p> This document is not confidential. </p>

<h2><a id="section-2" name="section-2">2. Background, MPS messages and
collections</a></h2>

<p> This needs filling in.  Taken as read and understood for now. </p>

<p> Note that some of the implementation (of mps_message_type_gc)
pre-dates this design; it may not be documented accurately (or at all)
here. </p>

<h2><a id="section-3" name="section-3">3. Requirements</a></h2>

<p> The primary requirement is: </p>

<ul>

  <li><p> MPS staff must be able to tell what collections are happening
    in order to be able to introspect about the overall MPS process. </p>

    <p> This
    is so that bugs can be diagnosed and general MPS behaviour can be
    reasoned about.  A typical problem is that a customer reports "Why
    when this collection happens doesn't this 20 MB of garbage get
    collected?".  At a minimum we need to know what was condemned in any
    particular collection; it useful to know what is going to happen to
    survivors. </p>

  </li>

</ul>

<p> We intend to meet that requirement by implementing a message
that is generated per generation per collection
(mps_message_type_gc_generation) and a message that is generated per
collection (mps_message_type_gc_start). </p>

We have the
following requirements on per generation messages: </p>

<ul>

  <li><p> Must be able to tell for any generation whether it is
  condemned for each collection that occurs.  In practise, due to the
  flexible nature of the MPS, a generation might not be either
  all-condemned or all-foundation for any particular collection.  In
  particular the commonest sort of collection (collections driven by
  allocation in the nursery generations) will condemn a particular set
  of zones. There may be generations which have some object in one zone
  and some objects in another; they may have only some of their objects
  condemned by a per zone condemnation strategy. </p>

  <p> For each generation for each collection we would like
    to know the following:  </p>

  <ul>

    <li><p> Number of bytes condemned in this generation. </p></li>

    <li><p> Number of bytes occupied by objects and not condemned.  </p></li>

    <li><p> Where survivors are going (that is, what generation are
    survivors are being promoted to. </p></li>

    <li><p> (Not essential) Other byte counts for this generation: How
    much free space there is, how much overhead there is. </p></li>

  </ul>

</ul>

<p> We have the following requirements on per GC messages: </p>

<ul>

  <li> <p> Must be able to tell why we are starting a collection. See
  job000666 for why we start collections. </p> </li>

</ul>

<h2><a id="section-4" name="section-4">4. Implementation</a></h2>

<h3><a id="section-4.1" name="section-4.1">4.1. A new per generation
message class (mps_message_type_gc_generation).</a></h3>

<p> Message in this class will support: </p>

<ul>
  
  <li><p> identification; each generation will be identified by
  (pool class, pool serial number, generation serial number). </p></li>

  <li><p> get condemned size </p></li>

  <li><p> get non-condemned size </p></li>

  <li><p> get forwarding gen </p></li>

</ul>

<p> Condemned size / not condemned size correspond to accessors for
MPS_MESSAGE_TYPE_GC as well.  We could have some sort of collectable
class that has both the existing "gc" and the new "gc generation" type
as sublcasses, but I don't think I'll bother for now.</p>

<h4><a id="section-4.1.1" name="section-4.1.1">4.1.1. Message instances.</a></h4>

<p> A message instance will be associated with a generation structure.
Specifically the PoolGenStruct; there is one of these per generation
in a pool that uses Chains for collection policy management.  The
message struct will be a member of PoolGenStruct to simplify memory
management as per the general <a href="../message">message design</a>.
</p>

<p> Choice: could put all the actual info in the PoolGenStruct and have
a generic message member (this is simplest if only PoolGenStruct wants
to implement the message) or could create a new gcgen message struct and
embed that in PoolGenStruct (which allows other parts of the MPS to
implement the message). </p>

<p> For now we will put the info (condemned size, etc) in the
PoolGenStruct and embed a generic message structure.  As per the trace
design, there will be a new intermediate struct, private to the PoolGen
module, that contains the info required for the message.
PoolGenMessageStruct. </p>

<p> There will only be one message and set of info per generation.
Generally data will refer to the most recent trace; multiple concurrent
traces are not very well suported by this design. </p>

<h3><a id="section-4.2" name="section-4.2">4.2 A new per collection
message class (mps_message_type_gc_start)</a></h3>

<p>Messages in this class support:<p>

<ul>

  <li> <p> Being able to tell why a collection is starting. </p> </li>

</ul>

<h4><a id="section-4.2.1" name="section-4.2.1">4.2.1 Message
instances.</a></h4>

<p> As well as TraceMessageStruct (for mps_message_type_gc) there will
be a TraceStartMessageStruct.  Could this be rolled into
TraceMessageStruct? Not really (maybe with a redesign) as
TraceMessageStruct is dynamically allocated as the message is posted to
the arena queue (at the end of the trace).</p>

<h2><a id="section-5" name="section-5">5. Interface</a></h2>

<dl>

  <dt> <p><code>int mps_message_type_gc_generation()</code></p> </dt>

  <dd> <p> Public interface.  Returns the message type for gc gen
  messages. </p> </dd>

  <dt> <p><code> const char *mps_message_gc_generation_name(mps_arena_t,
  mps_message_t)</code></p> </dt>

  <dd> <p> Public interface.  Returns a string pointer that identifies
  this generation.  The contents of the string shall not be modified by
  the client.  The string and the pointer are only valid as long as the
  message has not been discarded (with
  <code>mps_message_discard</code>). </p>
  
  <p> The string should be of the form: "[" <em>pool-class</em> ":"
  <em>pool-instance-number</em> "," <em>generation-number</em> "]" </p> </dd>

  <dt> <p><code>size_t mps_message_gc_generation_condemned_size(mps_arena_t,
  mps_message_t)</code></p> </dt>

  <dd> <p> Public interface.  Reports the number of condemned bytes in
  this generation for this collection.  May be an estimate. </p> </dd>

  <dt>
  <p><code>size_t mps_message_gc_generation_not_condemned_size(mps_arena_t,
  mps_message_t)</code></p> </dt>

  <dd> <p> Public interface.  Reports the number of bytes occupied by
  objects in this generation that are not condemned for this collection.
  May be an estimate. <p> </dd>

  <dt> <p></code>const char
  *mps_mesage_gc_generation_forward(mps_arena_t,
  mps_message_t)</code><p> </dt>

  <dd> <p> Public interface.  Returns a string pointer that identifies
  where survivors from this generation are being forwarded to.  The
  contents of the string shall not be modified by the client.  The
  string and the pointer are only valid as long as the message has not
  been discarded (with <code>mps_message_discard</code>). </p>

  <p> Generally this string will identify a generation and should be in
  a similar form to the id string (returned by
  <code>mps_message_gc_generation_id</code> </p> </dd>

  <dt> <code> MPS_MESSAGE_TYPE_GC_GENERATION </code> </dt>

  <dd> <p> Private interface.  An enum member that identifies the message
  type. </p> </dd>

  <dt> <code> int mps_message_type_gc_start() </code> </dt>

  <dd> <p> Public interface.  Returns the MPS message type. </p></dd>

  <dt> <code> const char *mps_message_gc_start_why(mps_arena_t,
  mps_message_t) </code> </dt>

  <dd> <p> Public interface.  Returns a pointer to a string that is a
  textual explanation of why this collection is starting. </p>

  <p> The contents of the string must not be modified by the client.  The
  string and the pointer are only valid as long as the message has not
  been discarded (with <code>mps_message_discard</code>). </p> </dd>

  <dt> PoolGen and PoolClass interface </dt>

  <dd> <p> There needs to be an interface between the implementation of the
  gc generation messages (which is expected to be PoolGen in locus.c)
  and the Pool Classes in order that the information contained in the
  message can be gathered. </p>
  
  <p> Pool Classes condemn objects on a
  segment-by-segment basis; it seems most natural for PoolGen to keep a
  condemned bytes counter and for the Pool Class to update this counter
  as it condemns objects.  The number of not-condemned bytes can be
  estimated by PoolGen as (totalSize - condemned). </p>

  <p> PoolGen knows the pool and the serial number so can id the
  generation without involving anyone else. </p>

  <p> The forwarding generation will have to be filled in by the Pool
  Class.  Message can hold a fixed size char buffer that the pool class
  can fill with textual description. </p> </dd>

</dl>

<h2><a id="section-6" name="section-6">6. Testing</a></h2>

<p> amcss already collects and reports mps_message_type_gc.  It should
be simple to extend it to mps_message_type_gc_start and
mps_message_type_gc_generation.  </p>

<p> Using amcss might not give a very good coverage.  In particular not
all the available reasons will appear.  Perhaps a more dedicated test
should be written. </p>
