<h2><a id="section-1" name="section-1">1. Introduction</a></h2>

<p> This document describes the design of a set of
<a href="../message/">MPS message</a> classes.  The messages from these
classes are emitted according to various important phases in a GC cycle;
collectively they are called GC Messages. </p>

<p> The current classes are: </p>

<dl>

  <dt> mps_message_type_gc_start() </dt>

  <dd> <p> (new in gcgenmsg branch) These messages are generated once per GC at the start of a
  GC. </p> </dd>

  <dt> mps_message_type_gc() </dt>

  <dd> <p> These messages are generated once per GC at the end of a GC. </p> </dd>

</dl>

<p> The intended readership is project staff. </p>

<p> This document is not confidential. </p>

<h2><a id="section-2" name="section-2">2. Background, MPS messages and
collections</a></h2>

<p> This needs filling in.  Taken as read and understood for now. </p>

<p> Note that some of the implementation (of mps_message_type_gc)
pre-dates this design; it may not be documented accurately (or at all)
here. </p>

<h2><a id="section-3" name="section-3">3. Requirements</a></h2>

<p> The primary requirement is: </p>

<ul>

  <li><p> MPS staff must be able to tell what collections are happening
    in order to be able to introspect about the overall MPS process.
    </p>

    <p> This
    is so that bugs can be diagnosed and general MPS behaviour can be
    reasoned about.  A typical problem is that a customer reports "Why
    when this collection happens doesn't this 20 MB of garbage get
    collected?".  At a minimum we need to know what was condemned in any
    particular collection; it useful to know what is going to happen to
    survivors. </p>

  </li>

</ul>

<p> We meet part of that requirement by implementing 
  a message that is generated per
collection (mps_message_type_gc_start). </p>

<p> We have the following requirements on per GC messages: </p>

<ul>

  <li> <p> Must be able to tell why we are starting a collection. See
  job000666 for why we start collections. </p> </li>

</ul>

<h3>Unimplemented mps_message_type_gc_generation</h3>

<p><em>This section for historical interest only.</em></p>

<p> A proposal to meet the full requirement by implementing a message
that is generated per generation per collection
(mps_message_type_gc_generation) 
<strong>has not been implemented</strong>, 
but the requirements have been retained here: </p>

<p>We would have the
following requirements on per generation messages: </p>

<ul>

  <li><p> Must be able to tell for any generation whether it is
  condemned for each collection that occurs.  In practise, due to the
  flexible nature of the MPS, a generation might not be either
  all-condemned or all-foundation for any particular collection.  In
  particular the commonest sort of collection (collections driven by
  allocation in the nursery generations) will condemn a particular set
  of zones. There may be generations which have some object in one zone
  and some objects in another; they may have only some of their objects
  condemned by a per zone condemnation strategy. </p></li>

  <li>
  <p> For each generation for each collection we would like
    to know the following:  </p>

  <ul>

    <li><p> Number of bytes condemned in this generation. </p></li>

    <li><p> Number of bytes occupied by objects and not condemned.  </p></li>

    <li><p> Where survivors are going (that is, what generation are
    survivors are being promoted to. </p></li>

    <li><p> (Not essential) Other byte counts for this generation: How
    much free space there is, how much overhead there is. </p></li>

  </ul>
  </li>

</ul>


<h2><a id="section-4" name="section-4">4. Implementation</a></h2>

<h3><a id="section-4.2" name="section-4.2">4.2 A new per collection
message class (mps_message_type_gc_start)</a></h3>

<p>Messages in this class support:</p>

<ul>

  <li> <p> Being able to tell why a collection is starting. </p> </li>

</ul>

<h4><a id="section-4.2.1" name="section-4.2.1">4.2.1 Message
instances.</a></h4>

<p> As well as TraceMessageStruct (for mps_message_type_gc) there will
be a TraceStartMessageStruct.  Could this be rolled into
TraceMessageStruct? Not really (maybe with a redesign) as
TraceMessageStruct is dynamically allocated as the message is posted to
the arena queue (at the end of the trace).</p>

<h2><a id="section-5" name="section-5">5. Interface</a></h2>

<dl>

  <dt> <code> int mps_message_type_gc_start() </code> </dt>

  <dd> <p> Public interface.  Returns the MPS message type. </p></dd>

  <dt> <code> const char *mps_message_gc_start_why(mps_arena_t,
  mps_message_t) </code> </dt>

  <dd> <p> Public interface.  Returns a pointer to a string that is a
  textual explanation of why this collection is starting. </p>

  <p> The contents of the string must not be modified by the client.  The
  string and the pointer are only valid as long as the message has not
  been discarded (with <code>mps_message_discard</code>). </p> </dd>

</dl>

<h2><a id="section-6" name="section-6">6. Testing</a></h2>

<p> amcss already collects and reports mps_message_type_gc.  It should
be simple to extend it to mps_message_type_gc_start and
mps_message_type_gc_generation.  </p>

<p> Using amcss might not give a very good coverage.  In particular not
all the available reasons will appear.  Perhaps a more dedicated test
should be written. </p>
