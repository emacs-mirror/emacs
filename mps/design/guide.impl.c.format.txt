Introduction
------------

_`.scope`: This document describes the Ravenbrook conventions for the
general format of C source code in the MPS.

_`.readership`: This document is intended for anyone working on or with the
C source code.


General formatting conventions
------------------------------

Line width
..........

_`.width`: Lines should be no wider than 72 characters. _`.width.why`: Many
people use 80 column terminal windows so that multiple windows can be
placed side by side. Restricting lines to 72 characters allows line
numbering to be used (in vi for example) and also allows diffs to be
displayed without overflowing the terminal.

White space
...........

_`.space.notab`: No tab characters should appear in the source files.
Ordinary spaces should be used to indent and format the sources.

_`.space.notab.why`: Tab characters are displayed differently on different
platforms, and sometimes translated back and forth, destroying layout
information.

_`.space.punct`: There should always be whitespace after commas and
semicolons and similar punctuation.

_`.space.op`: Put white space around operators in expressions, except when
removing it would make the expression clearer by binding certain
sub-expressions more tightly. For example::

    foo = x + y*z;

_`.space.control`: One space between a control-flow keyword
(``switch``, ``while``, ``for``, ``if``) and the following opening
parenthesis.

_`.space.control.why`: This distinguishes control statements lexically
from function calls, making it easier to distinguish them visually and
when searching with tools like ``grep``.

_`.space.function.not`: No space between a function name and the opening
parenthesis beginning its argument list.

Sections and paragraphs
.......................

_`.section`: Source files can be thought of as breaking down into
"sections" and "paragraphs". A section might be the leader comment of a
file, the imports, or a set of declarations which are related.

_`.section.space`: Precede sections by two blank lines (except the first
one in the file, which should be the leader comment in any case).

_`.section.comment`: Each section should start with a banner comment (see
`.comment.banner`_) describing what the section contains.

_`.para`: Within sections, code often breaks down into natural units called
"paragraphs". A paragraph might be a set of strongly related
declarations (Init and Finish, for example), or a few lines of code
which it makes sense to consider together (the assignment of fields into
a structure, for example).

_`.para.space`: Precede paragraphs by a single blank line.

Statements
..........

_`.statement.one`: Generally only have at most one statement per line. In
particular the following are deprecated::

    if (thing) return;  
 
    a=0; b=0;
 
    case 0: f = inRampMode ? AMCGen0RampmodeFrequency : AMCGen0Frequency;

_`.statement.one.why`: Debuggers can often only place breakpoints on lines,
not expressions or statements within a line. The ``if (thing) return;`` is
a particularly important case, if thing is a reasonably rare return
condition then you might want to breakpoint it in a debugger session.
Annoying because ``if (thing) return;`` is quite compact and pleasing
otherwise.

Indentation
...........

_`.indent`: Indent the body of a block by two spaces. For formatting
purposes, the "body of a block" means:

- statements between braces,
- a single statement following a lone ``if``;
- statements in a switch body; see .switch.

(_`.indent.logical`: The aim is to group what we think of as logical
blocks, even though they may not exactly match how "block" is used in
the definition of C syntax).

Some examples::

    if (res != ResOK) {
      SegFinish(&span->segStruct);
      PoolFreeP(MV->spanPool, span, sizeof(SpanStruct));
      return res;
    }

    if (res != ResOK)
      goto error;

    if (j == block->base) {
      if (j+step == block->limit) {
        if (block->thing)
          putc('@', stream);
      }
    } else if (j+step == block->limit) {
      putc(']', stream);
      pop_bracket();
    } else {
      putc('.', stream);
    }

    switch (c) {
    case 'A':
      c = 'A';
      p += 1;
      break;
    }

_`.indent.goto-label`: Place each goto-label on a line of its own,
outdented to the same level as the surrounding block. Then indent the
non-label part of the statement normally.

::

    result foo(void)
    {
      statement();
      if (error)
        goto foo;
      statement();
      return OK;

    foo:
      unwind();
      return ERROR;
    }

_`.indent.case-label`: Outdent case- and default-labels in a switch
statement in the same way as `.indent.goto-label`_.  See `.switch`_.

_`.indent.cont`: If an expression or statement won't fit on a single line,
indent the continuation lines by two spaces, apart from the following
exception:

_`.indent.cont.parens`: if you break a statement inside a parameter list or
other parenthesized expression, indent so that the continuation lines up
just after the open parenthesis. For example::

    PoolClassInit(&PoolClassMVStruct,
                  "MV", init, finish, allocP, freeP,
                  NULL, NULL, describe, isValid);

_`.indent.cont.expr`: Note that when breaking an expression it is clearer
to place the operator at the start of the continuation line::

    CHECKL(AddrAdd((Addr)chunk->pageTableMapped,
                   BTSize(chunk->pageTablePages))
           <= AddrAdd(chunk->base, chunk->ullageSize));

This is particularly useful in long conditional expressions that use &&
and ||. For example::

    } while(trace->state != TraceFINISHED
            && (trace->emergency || traceWorkClock(trace) < pollEnd));

_`.indent.hint`: Usually, it is possible to determine the correct
indentation for a line by looking to see if the previous line ends with
a semicolon. If it does, indent to the same amount, otherwise indent by
two more spaces. The main exceptions are lines starting with a close
brace, goto-labels, and line-breaks between parentheses.

Positioning of braces
.....................

_`.brace.otb`: Use the "One True Brace" (or OTB) style. This places the
open brace after the control word or expression, separated by a space,
and when there is an else, places that after the close brace. For
example::

    if(isBase) {
      new->base = limit;
      new->limit = block->limit;
      block->limit = base;
      new->next = block->next;
      block->next = new;
    } else {
      new->base = block->base;
      new->limit = base;
      block->base = limit;
      new->next = block;
      *prev = new;
    }

The same applies to struct, enum, union.

_`.brace.otb.function.not`: OTB is never used for function definitions.

_`.brace.always`: Braces are always required after ``if``, ``else``, ``switch``,
``while``, ``do``, and ``for``.

_`.brace.always.except`: Except that a lone ``if`` with no ``else`` is allowed
to drop its braces when its body is a single simple statement. Typically
this will be a ``goto`` or an assignment. For example::

    if (res != ResOK)
      goto failStart;

Note in particular that an ``if`` with an ``else`` must have braces on both
paths.

Switch statements
.................

_`.switch`: format switch statements like this::

    switch (action) {
    case WIBBLE:
    case WOBBLE:
      {
        int angle;
        err = move(plate, action, &angle);
      }
      break;

    case QUIET:
      drop();
      /* fall-through */

    case QUIESCENT:
      err = 0;
      break;

    default:
      NOTREACHED;
      break;
    }

The component rules that result in this style are:

_`.switch.break`: The last line of every case-clause body must be an
unconditional jump statement (usually ``break``, but may be ``goto``,
``continue``, or ``return``), or if a fall-through is intended, the comment
``/* fall-through */``. (Note: if the unconditional jump should never be
taken, because of previous conditional jumps, use ``NOTREACHED`` on the
line before it). This rule is to prevent accidental fall-throughs, even
if someone makes a editing mistake that causes a conditional jump to be
missed.

_`.switch.default`: It is usually a good idea to have a default-clause,
even if all it contains is ``NOTREACHED`` and ``break``.  Remember that
``NOTREACHED`` doesn't stop the process in all build varieties.


Comments
........

_`.comment`: There are three types of comments: banners, paragraph
comments, and column comments.

_`.comment.banner`: Banner comments come at the start of sections. A banner
comment consists of a heading usually composed of a symbol, an em-dash
(--) and an short explanation, followed by English text which is
formatted using conventional text documentation guidelines (see
guide.text). The open and close comment tokens (``/*`` and ``*/``) are
placed at the top and bottom of a column of asterisks. The text is
separated from the asterisks by one space. Place a blank line between
the banner comment and the section it comments. For example::

    /* BlockStruct --  Block descriptor
     *
     * The pool maintains a descriptor structure for each 
     * contiguous allocated block of memory it manages.  
     * The descriptor is on a simple linked-list of such 
     * descriptors, which is in ascending order of address.
     */
 
    typedef struct BlockStruct {

_`.comment.para`: Paragraph comments come at the start of paragraphs
in the code. A paragraph comment consists of formatted English text.
For example::

      /* If the freed area is in the base sentinel then insert
         the new descriptor after it, otherwise insert before. */
      if (isBase) {

_`.comment.para.precede`: Paragraph comments, even one-liners, precede the
code to which they apply.

_`.comment.column`: Column comments appear in a column to the right of
the code. They should be used sparingly, since they clutter the code and
make it hard to edit. Use them on variable declarations and structure,
union, or enum declarations. They should start at least at column 32
(counting from 0, that is, on a tab-stop), and should be terse
descriptive text. Abandon English sentence structure if this makes the
comment clearer. Don't write more than one line. Here's an example::

      typedef struct PoolMVStruct {
        Pool blockPool;           /* for block descriptors */
        Pool spanPool;            /* for span descriptors */
        size_t extendBy;          /* size to extend pool by */
        size_t avgSize;           /* estimate of allocation size */
        size_t maxSize;           /* estimate of maximum size */
        Addr space;               /* total free space in pool */
        Addr lost;                /* lost when free can't allocate */
        struct SpanStruct *spans; /* span chain */
      } PoolMVStruct;

Macros
......

_`.macro.careful`: Macros in C are a real horror bag, be extra careful.
There's lots that could go here, but proper coverage probably deserves a
separate document. Which isn't written yet.

_`.macro.general`: Do try and follow the other formatting conventions for
code in macro definitions.

_`.macro.backslash`: Backslashes used for continuation lines in macro
definitions should be put on the right somewhere where they will be less
in the way. Example::

    #define RAMP_RELATION(X)                       \
      X(RampOUTSIDE,        "outside ramp")        \
      X(RampBEGIN,          "begin ramp")          \
      X(RampRAMPING,        "ramping")             \
      X(RampFINISH,         "finish ramp")         \
      X(RampCOLLECTING,     "collecting ramp")


History
-------

- 2007-06-04  DRJ_  Adopted from Harlequin MMinfo version and edited.

- 2007-06-04  DRJ_  Changed .width from 80 to 72. Banned space between
  ``if`` and ``(``. Required braces on almost everything. Clarified that
  paragraph comments precede the code.

- 2007-06-13  RHSK_  Removed .brace.block, because MPS source always
  uses .brace.otb. Remove .indent.elseif because it is obvious (ahem) and
  showing an example is sufficient. New rules for .switch.*: current MPS
  practice is a mess, so lay down a neat new law.

- 2007-06-27  RHSK_  Added `.space.function.not`_.

- 2007-07-17  DRJ_  Added .macro.\*

- 2012-09-26  RB_  Converted to Markdown and reversed inconsistent
  switch "law".
