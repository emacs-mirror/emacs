Introduction
------------

_`.intro`: This is the design of the Range module, which implements
objects representing address ranges.

_`.readership`: This document is intended for any MPS developer.


Requirements
------------

_`.req.range`: A range object must be able to represent an arbitrary
range of addresses that does not include the top grain of the address
space.

_`.req.empty`: A range object must be able to represent the empty
range.

_`.req.stack-alloc`: It must be possible to allocate range objects on
the stack: that is, they do not require any heap resource.


Interface
---------

``typedef RangeStruct *Range``

``Range`` is the type of a range. It is an alias for ``RangeStruct *``. ``RangeStruct`` is defined in the header so that it can be
inlined in client structures or allocated on the stack. Clients must
not depend on its implementation details.

``void RangeInit(Range range, Addr base, Addr limit)``

Initialize a range object to represent the half-open address range
between ``base`` (inclusive) and ``limit`` (exclusive). It must be the
case that ``base <= limit``. If ``base == limit`` then the range is
empty.

``void RangeFinish(Range range)``

Finish a range object. Because a range object uses no heap resources
(`.req.stack-alloc`_) it is not necessary to call this. However,
clients may wish to do so in order to ensure that the range object is
invalid.

``Addr RangeBase(Range range)``

Return the base of the range. (This is implemented as a macro, but
there is a function too.)

``Addr RangeLimit(Range range)``

Return the limit of the range. (This is implemented as a macro, but
there is a function too.)

``Size RangeSize(Range range)``

Return the size of the range. (This is implemented as a macro, but
there is a function too. The macro evaluates its argument twice.)

``Bool RangeIsAligned(Range range, Align alignment)``

Return ``TRUE`` if the base and limit of the range are both aligned to
the given alignment, or ``FALSE`` if either is not.

``Bool RangesOverlap(Range range1, Range range2)``

Return ``TRUE`` if the two ranges overlap (have at least one address
in common), or ``FALSE`` if they do not. Note that ranges [*A*, *B*) and
[*B*, *C*) do not overlap.

``Bool RangesNest(Range outer, Range inner)``

Return ``TRUE`` if all addresses in ``inner`` are also in ``outer``,
or ``FALSE`` otherwise.
