Introduction
------------

_`.intro`: This is the design of the Range module, which implements
objects representing address ranges.

_`readership`: This document is intended for any MPS developer.


Requirements
------------

_`.req.range` A range object must be able to represent an arbitrary
range of addresses.

_`.req.empty` A range object must be able to represent the empty
range.

_`.req.whole` A range object must be able to represent the whole of
address space.

_`.req.stack-alloc` It must be possible to allocate range objects on
the stack: that is, they do not require any heap resource.


Interface
---------

.. c:type:: Range

``Range`` is the type of a range. It is an alias for ``RangeStruct
*``. ``RangeStruct`` is defined in the header so that it can be
inlined in clients structures or allocated on the stack. Clients must
must not depend on its implementation details.

.. c:function:: Res RangeInit(Range range, Addr base, Addr limit)

Initialize a range object to represent the half-open address range
between ``base`` (inclusive) and ``limit`` (exclusive). It must be the
case that ``base <= limit``. If ``base == limit`` then the range is
empty.

.. c:function:: void RangeFinish(Range range)

Finish a range object. Because a range object uses no heap resources
(`.req.stack-alloc`_) it is not necessary to call this. However,
clients may wish to do so in order to ensure that the range object is
invalid.

.. c:function:: Addr RangeBase(Range range)

Return the base of the range.

.. c:function:: Addr RangeLimit(Range range);

Return the limit of the range.

.. c:function:: Size (RangeSize)(Range range)

Return the size of the range.

.. c:function:: Bool RangeOverlap(Range range1, Range range2)

Return ``TRUE`` if the two ranges overlap (have at least one address
in common), or ``FALSE`` if they do not. Note that ranges [A, B) and
[B, C) do not overlap.
