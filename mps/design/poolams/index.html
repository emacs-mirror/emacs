OVERVIEW

<a id="overview" name="overview">.overview</a>: This document describes the design of the AMS pool class.
The AMS pool is a proof-of-concept design for a mark-sweep pool in the
MPS.  It's not meant to be efficient, but it could serve as a model
for an implementation of a more advanced pool (such as EPVM).


REQUIREMENTS

<a id="req.mark-sweep" name="req.mark-sweep">.req.mark-sweep</a>: The pool must use a mark-and-sweep GC algorithm.

<a id="req.colour" name="req.colour">.req.colour</a>: The colour representation should be as efficient as
possible.

<a id="req.incremental" name="req.incremental">.req.incremental</a>: The pool must support incremental GC.

<a id="req.ambiguous" name="req.ambiguous">.req.ambiguous</a>: The pool must support ambiguous references to objects
in it (but ambiguous references into the middle of an object do not
preserve the object).

<a id="req.format" name="req.format">.req.format</a>: The pool must be formatted, for generality.

<a id="req.correct" name="req.correct">.req.correct</a>: The design and the implementation should be simple
enough to be seen to be correct.

<a id="req.simple" name="req.simple">.req.simple</a>: Features not related to mark-and-sweep GC should
initially be implemented as simply as possible, in order to save
development effort.

<a id="not-req.grey" name="not-req.grey">.not-req.grey</a>: We haven't figured out how buffers ought to work with a
grey mutator, so we use .req.correct to allow us to design a pool that
doesn't work in that phase.  This is acceptable as long as we haven't
actually implemented grey mutator collection.


ARCHITECTURE

Subclassing

<a id="subclass" name="subclass">.subclass</a>: Since we expect to have many mark-and-sweep pools, we build
in some protocol for subclasses to modify various aspects of the
behaviour.  Notably there's a subclassable segment class, and a
protocol for performing iteration.


Allocation

<a id="align" name="align">.align</a>: We divide the segments in grains, each the size of the format
alignment.  <a id="alloc-bit-table" name="alloc-bit-table">.alloc-bit-table</a>: We keep track of allocated grains using
a bit table.  This allows a simple implementation of allocation and
freeing using the bit table operators, satisfying .req.simple, and can
simplify the GC routines. Eventually, this should use some
sophisticated allocation technique suitable for non-moving automatic
pools.

<a id="buffer" name="buffer">.buffer</a>: We use buffered allocation, satisfying .req.incremental.  The
AMC buffer technique is reused, although it is not suitable for
non-moving pools, but req.simple allows us to do that for now.

<a id="extend" name="extend">.extend</a>: If there's no space in any existing segment, a new segment is
allocated.  The actual class is allowed to decide the size of the new
segment.

<a id="no-alloc" name="no-alloc">.no-alloc</a>: Do not support PoolAlloc, because we can't support
one-phase allocation for a scannable pool (unless we disallow
incremental collection).  For exact details, see design.mps.buffer.

<a id="no-free" name="no-free">.no-free</a>: Do not support PoolFree, because automatic pools don't need
explicit free and having it encourages clients to use it (and
therefore to have dangling pointers, double frees, etc.)


Colours

<a id="colour" name="colour">.colour</a>: Objects in a segment which is _not_ condemned (for some
trace) take their colour (for this trace) from the segment.
<a id="colour.object" name="colour.object">.colour.object</a>: Since we need to implement a non-copying GC, we keep
track of the colour of each object in a condemned segment separately.
For this, we use bit tables with a bit for each grain.  This format is
fast to access, has better locality than mark bits in the objects
themselves, and allows cheap interoperation with the allocation bit
table.  <a id="colour.encoding" name="colour.encoding">.colour.encoding</a>: As to the details, we follow
analysis.non-moving-colour(3), implementing both the alloc-white
sharing option described in
analysis.non-moving-colour.constraint.reclaim.white-free-bit and the
vanilla three-table option, because the former cannot work with
interior pointers.  However, the colour encoding in both is the same.

<a id="ambiguous.middle" name="ambiguous.middle">.ambiguous.middle</a>: We will allow ambiguous references into the middle
of an object (as required by .req.ambiguous), using the trick in
analysis.non-moving-colour.interior.ambiguous-only to speed up
scanning.  <a id="interior-pointer" name="interior-pointer">.interior-pointer</a>: Note that non-ambiguous interior
pointers are outlawed.

<a id="colour.alloc" name="colour.alloc">.colour.alloc</a>: Objects are allocated black.  This is the most
efficient alternative for traces in the black mutator phase, and
.not-req.grey means that's sufficient.  [Some day, we need to think
about allocating grey or white during the grey mutator phase.]


Scanning

<a id="scan.segment" name="scan.segment">.scan.segment</a>: The tracer protocol requires (for segment barrier hits)
that there is a method for scanning a segment and turning all grey
objects on it black.  This cannot be achieved with a single sequential
sweep over the segment, since objects that the sweep has already
passed may become grey as later objects are scanned.  <a id="scan.graph" name="scan.graph">.scan.graph</a>: For
a non-moving GC, it is more efficient to trace along the reference
graph than segment by segment [it would also allow passing type
information from fix to scan].  Currently, the tracer doesn't offer
this option when it's polling for work.

<a id="scan.stack" name="scan.stack">.scan.stack</a>: Tracing along the reference graph cannot be done by
recursive descent, because we can't guarantee that the stack won't
overflow.  We can, however, maintain an explicit stack of things to
trace, and fall back on iterative methods (.scan.iter) when it
overflows and can't be extended.

<a id="scan.iter" name="scan.iter">.scan.iter</a>: As discussed in .scan.segment, when scanning a segment, we
need to ensure that there are no grey objects in the segment when the
scan method returns.  We can do this by iterating a sequential scan
over the segment until nothing is grey (see .marked.scan for details).
<a id="scan.iter.only" name="scan.iter.only">.scan.iter.only</a>: Some iterative method is needed as a fallback for the
more advanced methods, and as this is the simplest way of implementing
the current tracer protocol, we will start by implementing it as the
only scanning method.

<a id="scan.buffer" name="scan.buffer">.scan.buffer</a>: We do not scan between ScanLimit and Limit of a buffer
(see .iteration.buffer), as usual [design.mps.buffer should explain
why this works, but doesn't.  Pekka 1998-02-11].

<a id="fix.to-black" name="fix.to-black">.fix.to-black</a>: When fixing a reference to a white object, if the
segment does not refer to the white set, the object cannot refer to
the white set, and can therefore be marked as black immediately
(rather than grey).


IMPLEMENTATION

Colour

<a id="colour.determine" name="colour.determine">.colour.determine</a>: Following the plan in .colour, if SegWhite(seg)
includes the trace, the colour of an object is given by the bit
tables.  Otherwise if SegGrey(seg) includes the trace, all the objects
are grey.  Otherwise all the objects are black.

<a id="colour.bits" name="colour.bits">.colour.bits</a>: As we only have searches for runs of zero bits, we use
two bit tables, the non-grey and non-white tables, but this is hidden
beneath a layer of macros talking about grey and white in positive
terms.

<a id="colour.single" name="colour.single">.colour.single</a>: We have only implemented a single set of mark and scan
tables, so we can only condemn a segment for one trace at a time.
This is checked for in condemnation.  If we want to do overlapping
white sets, each trace needs its own set of tables.

<a id="colour.check" name="colour.check">.colour.check</a>: The
grey&amp;non-white state is illegal, and free objects must be white as
explained in analysis.non-moving-colour.contraint.reclaim.


Iteration

<a id="iteration" name="iteration">.iteration</a>: Scan, reclaim and other operations need to iterate over
all objects in a segment.  We abstract this into a single iteration
function, even though we no longer use it for reclaiming and rarely
for scanning.

<a id="iteration.buffer" name="iteration.buffer">.iteration.buffer</a>: Iteration skips directly from ScanLimit to Limit of
a buffer.  This is because this area may contain partially-initialized
and uninitialized data, which cannot be processed.  [ScanLimit is used
for reasons which are not documented in design.mps.buffer.]  Since the
iteration skips the buffer, callers need to take the appropriate
action, if any, on it.


Scanning Algorithm

<a id="marked" name="marked">.marked</a>: Each segment has a 'marksChanged' flag, indicating whether
anything in it has been made grey since the last scan iteration
(.scan.iter) started.  This flag only concerns the colour of objects
with respect to the trace for which the segment is condemned, as this
is the only trace for which objects in the segment are being made grey
by fixing.  Note that this flag doesn't imply that there are grey
objects in the segment, because the grey objects might have been
subsequently scanned and blackened.

<a id="marked.fix" name="marked.fix">.marked.fix</a>: The marksChanged flag is set TRUE by AMSFix when an
object is made grey.

<a id="marked.scan" name="marked.scan">.marked.scan</a>: AMSScan must blacken all grey objects on the segment, so
it must iterate over the segment until all grey objects have been
seen.  Scanning an object in the segment might grey another one
(.marked.fix), so the scanner iterates until this flag is FALSE,
setting it to FALSE before each scan.  It is safe to scan the segment
even if it contains nothing grey.

<a id="marked.scan.fail" name="marked.scan.fail">.marked.scan.fail</a>: If the format scanner returns failure (see
protocol.mps.scanning [is that the best reference?]), we abort the
scan in the middle of a segment.  So in this case the marksChanged
flag is set back to TRUE, because we may not have blackened all grey
objects.

<a id="marked.unused" name="marked.unused">.marked.unused</a>: The marksChanged flag is meaningless unless the
segment is condemned.  We make it FALSE in these circumstances.

<a id="marked.condemn" name="marked.condemn">.marked.condemn</a>: Condemnation makes all objects in a segment either
black or white, leaving nothing grey, so it doesn't need to set the
marksChanged flag which must already be FALSE.

<a id="marked.reclaim" name="marked.reclaim">.marked.reclaim</a>: When a segment is reclaimed, it can contain nothing
marked as grey, so the marksChanged flag must already be FALSE.

<a id="marked.blacken" name="marked.blacken">.marked.blacken</a>: When the tracer decides not to scan, but to call
PoolBlacken, we know that any greyness can be removed.  AMSBlacken
does this and resets the marksChanged flag, if it finds that the
segment has been condemned.

<a id="marked.clever" name="marked.clever">.marked.clever</a>: AMS could be clever about not setting the marksChanged
flag, if the fixed object is ahead of the current scan pointer.  It
could also keep low- and high-water marks of grey objects, but we
don't need to implement these improvements at first.


Allocation

<a id="buffer-init" name="buffer-init">.buffer-init</a>: We take one init arg to set the Rank on the buffer, just
to see how it's done.

<a id="no-bit" name="no-bit">.no-bit</a>: As an optimization, we won't use the alloc bit table until
the first reclaim on the segment.  Before that, we just keep a
high-water mark.

<a id="fill" name="fill">.fill</a>: AMSBufferFill takes the simplest approach: it iterates over the
segments in the pool, looking for one which can be used to refill the
buffer.  <a id="fill.colour" name="fill.colour">.fill.colour</a>: The objects allocated from the new buffer must
be black for all traces (.colour.alloc), so putting it on a black
segment (meaning one where neither SegWhite(seg) nor SegGrey(seg)
include the trace, see .colour.determine) is obviously OK.  White
segments (where SegWhite(seg) includes the trace) are also fine, as we
can use the colour tables to make it black.  At first glance, it seems
we can't put it on a segment that is grey but not white for some trace
(one where SegWhite(seg) doesn't include the trace, but SegGrey(seg)
does), because the new objects would become grey as the buffer's
ScanLimit advanced.  However, in many configurations, the mutator
would hit a barrier as soon as it started initializing the object,
which would flip the buffer. In fact, the current (2002-01)
implementation of buffers assumes buffers are black, so they'd better.
<a id="fill.colour.reclaim" name="fill.colour.reclaim">.fill.colour.reclaim</a>: In fact, putting a buffer on a condemned segment
will screw up the accounting in AMCReclaim, so it's disallowed.

<a id="fill.slow" name="fill.slow">.fill.slow</a>: AMSBufferFill gets progressively slower as more segments
fill up, as it laboriously checks whether the buffer can be refilled
from each segment, by inspecting the allocation bit map.  This is
helped a bit by keeping count of free grains in each segment, but it
still spends a lot of time iterating over all the full segments
checking the free size.  Obviously, this can be much improved (we
could keep track of the largest free block in the segment and in the
pool, or we could keep the segments in some more efficient structure,
or we could have a real free list structure).

<a id="fill.extend" name="fill.extend">.fill.extend</a>: If there's no space in any existing segment, the segSize
method is called to decide the size of the new segment to allocate.
If that fails, the code tries to allocate a segment that's just large
enough to satisfy the request.

<a id="empty" name="empty">.empty</a>: AMSBufferEmpty makes the unused space free, since there's no
reason not to.  We have to adjust the colour tables as well, since
these grains were black and now they need to be white (or at least
encoded -G and W).

<a id="reclaim.empty.buffer" name="reclaim.empty.buffer">.reclaim.empty.buffer</a>: Segments which after reclaim only contain a
buffer could be destroyed by trapping the buffer, but there's no point
to this.


Initialization

<a id="init" name="init">.init</a>: The initialization method AMSInit() takes three additional
arguments: the format of objects allocated in the pool, the chain that
controls GC timing, and a flag for supporting ambiguous references.
<a id="init.share" name="init.share">.init.share</a>: If support for ambiguity is required, the shareAllocTable
flag is reset to indicate the pool uses three separate bit tables,
otherwise it is set and the pool shares a table for non-white and
alloc (see .colour.encoding).

<a id="init.align" name="init.align">.init.align</a>: The pool alignment is set equal to the format alignment
(see design.mps.align).

<a id="init.internal" name="init.internal">.init.internal</a>: Subclasses call AMSInitInternal() to avoid the
problems of sharing va_list and emitting a superfluous PoolInitAMS
event.


Condemnation

<a id="condemn.buffer" name="condemn.buffer">.condemn.buffer</a>: Buffers are not condemned, instead they are coloured
black, to make sure that the objects allocated will be black,
following .colour.alloc (or, if you wish, because buffers are ignored
like free space, so need the same encoding).


Reclaim

<a id="reclaim" name="reclaim">.reclaim</a>: Reclaim uses either of analysis.non-moving-colour
.constraint.reclaim.white-free-bit (just reuse the non-white table as
the alloc table) or
analysis.non-moving-colour.constraint.reclaim.free-bit (copy it),
depending on the shareAllocTable flag (as set by
.init.share). However, bit table still has to be iterated over to
count the free grains.  Also, in a debug pool, each white block has to
be splatted.


Segment Merging and Splitting

<a id="split-merge" name="split-merge">.split-merge</a>: We provide methods for splitting and merging AMS
segments.  The pool implementation doesn't cause segments to be split
or merged - but a subclass might want to do this (see
.stress.split-merge).  The methods serve as an example of how to
implement this facility.

<a id="split-merge.constrain" name="split-merge.constrain">.split-merge.constrain</a>: There are some additional constraints on what
segments may be split or merged:

<a id="split-merge.constrain.align" name="split-merge.constrain.align">.split-merge.constrain.align</a>: Segments may only be split or merged at
an address which is aligned to the pool alignment as well as to the
arena alignment. <a id="split-merge.constrain.align.justify" name="split-merge.constrain.align.justify">.split-merge.constrain.align.justify</a>: This constraint
is implied by the design of allocation and colour tables, which cannot
represent segments starting at unaligned addresses.  The constraint
only arises if the pool alignment is larger than the arena alignment.
There's no requirement to split segments at unaligned addresses.

<a id="split-merge.constrain.empty" name="split-merge.constrain.empty">.split-merge.constrain.empty</a>: The higher segment must be empty. That
is, the higher segment passed to SegMerge must be empty, and the
higher segment returned by SegSplit must be
empty. <a id="split-merge.constrain.empty.justify" name="split-merge.constrain.empty.justify">.split-merge.constrain.empty.justify</a>: This constraint makes the
code significantly simpler.  There's no requirement for a more complex
solution at the moment (as the purpose is primarily pedagogic).

<a id="split-merge.fail" name="split-merge.fail">.split-merge.fail</a>: The split and merge methods are not proper
anti-methods for each other (see
design.mps.seg.split-merge.fail.anti.no).  Methods will not reverse
the side-effects of their counterparts if the allocation of the colour
and allocation bit tables should fail.  Client methods which over-ride
split and merge should not be written in such a way that they might
detect failure after calling the next method, unless they have reason
to know that the bit table allocations will not fail.


TESTING

<a id="stress" name="stress">.stress</a>: There's a stress test, MMsrc!amsss.c, that does 800 kB of
allocation, enough for about three GCs.  It uses a modified Dylan
format, and checks for corruption by the GC.  Both ambiguous and exact
roots are tested.

<a id="stress.split-merge" name="stress.split-merge">.stress.split-merge</a>: There's also a stress test for segment splitting
and merging, MMsrc!segsmss.c.  This is similar to amsss.c - but it
defines a subclass of AMS, and causes segments to be split and merged.
Both buffered and non-buffered segments are split / merged.


NOTES

<a id="addr-index.slow" name="addr-index.slow">.addr-index.slow</a>: Translating from an address to and from a grain
index in a segment uses macros such as AMS_INDEX and AMS_INDEX_ADDR.
These are slow because they call SegBase on every translation - we
could cache that.

<a id="grey-mutator" name="grey-mutator">.grey-mutator</a>: To enforce the restriction set in .not-req.grey we
check that all the traces are flipped in AMSScan.  It would be good to
check in AMSFix as well, but we can't do that, because it's called
during the flip, and we can't tell the difference between the flip and
the grey mutator phases with the current tracer interface.
