Overview
--------

MFS stands for "Manual Fixed Small". The MFS pool class manages
objects that are of a fixed size. It is intended to only manage small
objects efficiently. Storage is recycled manually by the client
programmer.

A particular instance of an MFS Pool can manage objects only of a
single size, but different instances can manage objects of different
sizes. The size of object that an instance can manage is declared when
the instance is created.

MFS operates in a very simple manner: each extent allocated from the
arena is divided into units.  Free units are kept on a linked list
using a header stored in the unit itself.  The linked list is not
ordered; allocation and deallocation simply pop and push from the head
of the list.  This is fast, but successive allocations might have poor
locality if previous successive frees did.

The list of extents belonging to the pool is maintained as a ring with
a node at the start of each extent.

Storing the linked list of free nodes and the extent ring node in the
managed memory is against the general principle of the MPS design,
which keeps its management structures away from client memory.
However, the MFS pool is used during the bootstrapping process (see
design.mps.bootstrap) and so has no other memory pools available for
storage.
