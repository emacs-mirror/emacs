Overview
--------

MFS stands for "Manual Fixed Small". The MFS pool class manages
objects that are of a fixed size. It is intended to only manage small
objects efficiently. Storage is recycled manually by the client
programmer.

A particular instance of an MFS Pool can manage objects only of a
single size, but different instances can manage objects of different
sizes. The size of object that an instance can manage is declared when
the instance is created.
