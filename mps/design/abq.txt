Introduction
------------

_`.intro`: This is the design of the ABQ module, which implements a
fixed-length queue of small objects.

_`.readership`: This document is intended for any MM developer.

_`.name`: The name ABQ originally stood for "Available Block Queue" as
the module is used by the MVT pool.


Requirements
------------

_`.req.push`: Clients can efficiently push new elements onto the queue.

_`.req.pop`: Clients can efficiently pop elements from the queue.

_`.req.empty`: Clients can efficiently test whether the queue is empty.

_`.req.abstract`: The ABQ module does not know anything about the
elements in the queue other than their size.

_`.req.delete`: Clients can delete elements from the queue. (Note: not necessarily efficiently.)

_`.req.iterate`: Clients can iterate over elements in the queue.


Interface
---------

``typedef ABQStruct *ABQ``

``ABQ`` is the type of a queue. It is an alias for ``ABQStruct *``.
``ABQStruct`` is defined in the header so that it can be inlined in
client structures: clients must not depend on its implementation
details.

``ABQInit(Arena arena, ABQ abq, void *owner, Count elements, Size elementSize)``

Initialize the queue ``abq``. The parameter ``arena`` is the arena
whose control pool should be used to allocate the memory for the
queue; ``owner`` is passed to ``MeterInit()`` for the statistics;
``elements`` is the maximum number of elements that can be stored in
the queue; and ``elementSize`` is the size of each element.

``void ABQFinish(Arena arena, ABQ abq)``

Finish ``abq`` and free all resources associated with it.

``Bool ABQPush(ABQ abq, void *element)``

If the queue is full, leave it unchanged and return ``FALSE``.
Otherwise, push ``element`` on to the queue and return ``TRUE``.

``Bool ABQPop(ABQ abq, void *elementReturn)``

If the queue is empty, return ``FALSE``. Otherwise, copy the first
element on the queue into the memory pointed to by ``elementReturn``,
remove the element from the queue, and return ``TRUE``.

``Bool ABQPeek(ABQ abq, void *elementReturn)``

If the queue is empty, return ``FALSE``. Otherwise, copy the first
element on the queue into the memory pointed to by ``elementReturn``
and return ``TRUE``. (This is the same as ``ABQPop()`` except that
the queue is unchanged.)

``Bool ABQIsEmpty(ABQ abq)``

If the queue is empty, return ``TRUE``, otherwise return ``FALSE``.

``Bool ABQIsFull(ABQ abq)``

If the queue is full, return ``TRUE``, otherwise return ``FALSE``.

``Count ABQDepth(ABQ abq)``

Return the number of elements in the queue.

``typedef Bool (*ABQIterateMethod)(Bool *deleteReturn, void *element, void *closureP, Size closureS)``

A callback function for ``ABQIterate()``. The parameter ``element`` is
an element in the queue, and ``closureP`` and ``closureS`` are the
values that were originally passed to ``ABQIterate()``. This function
must set ``*deleteReturn`` to ``FALSE`` if ``element`` must be kept in
the queue, or ``TRUE`` if ``element`` must be deleted from the queue.
It must return ``TRUE`` if the iteration must continue, or ``FALSE``
if the iteration must stop after processing ``element``.

``void ABQIterate(ABQ abq, ABQIterateMethod iterate, void *closureP, Size closureS)``

Call ``iterate`` for each elements in the queue, passing the element
and ``closureP``. See ``ABQIterateMethod`` for details.
