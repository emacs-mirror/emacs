         THE DESIGN OF THE MEMORY POOL SYSTEM SIGNATURE SYSTEM
                             design.mps.sig
                           incomplete design
                           richard 1995-08-25


TESTING:

<a id="test.uniq" name="test.uniq">.test.uniq</a>: The unix command
sed -n '/^#define [a-zA-Z]*Sig/s/[^(]*(/(/p' *.[ch]| sort| uniq -c
will display all signatures defined in the mps along with a count of how many 
times they are defined.  If any counts are greater than 1, then the same 
signature value is being used for different signatures.  This is undesirable 
and the problem should be investigated.  People not using unix may still find 
the RE useful.


TEXT:

Signatures are magic numbers which are written into structures
when they are created and invalidated (by overwriting with
SigInvalid) when they are destroyed.  They provide a limited form
of run-time type checking and dynamic scope checking.

Signature values should be transliterations of the corresponding words into 
hex, as guide.hex.trans.  The first three hex digits should be the 
transliteration of "SIG".
