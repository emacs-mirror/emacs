Introduction
------------

_`.intro`: This is the design of the clock module, which implements a
fast high-resolution clock for use by the telemetry system.

_`.readership`: This document is intended for any MPS developer.


Requirements
------------

_`.req.monotonic`: Successive calls to ``EVENT_CLOCK()`` must yield
values that are monotonically increasing. (So that comparing the
timestamp on two events never gives false positives.)

_`.req.fast`: ``EVENT_CLOCK()`` should take very little time; it
should not require a system call. (So that programs that use the MPS
remain usable when telemetry is turned on.)

_`.req.high-resolution`: Successive calls to ``EVENT_CLOCK()`` should
yield values that are strictly monotonically increasing (so that
sorting the telemetry stream puts the events in the order they
happened).


Interface
---------

``EventClock``

_`.if.type`: The type of timestamps. It must be an unsigned 64-bit
integral type, for example a ``typedef`` for ``uint64_t`` or
``unsigned __int64``.

``EVENT_CLOCK_MAKE(lvalue, low, high)``

_`.if.make`: Construct an ``EventClock`` timestamp from its two
halves. The first parameter is an lvalue with type ``EventClock``, and
the second and third parameters are 32-bit unsigned integers. The
macro must assign a timestamp to ``lvalue`` with the value ``(high
<< 32) + low``.

``EVENT_CLOCK(lvalue)``

_`.if.get`: Assign an ``EventClock`` timestamp for the current time to
``lvalue``, which is an lvalue with type ``EventClock``.

``EVENT_CLOCK_PRINT(FILE *stream, EventClock clock)``

_`.if.print`: Write the value of ``clock`` to the standard C output
file handle ``stream`` as 16 hexadecimal digits (with leading zeros,
and capital letters A to F).

``EVENT_CLOCK_WRITE(mps_lib_FILE *stream, EventClock clock)``

_`.if.write`: Write the value of ``clock`` to the output stream
``stream`` as 16 hexadecimal digits (with leading zeros, and capital
letters A to F). The macro should be implemented using ``WriteF()``.


Implementation
--------------

_`.impl.tsc`: On IA-32 and x86-64, the `Time Stamp Counter
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Stamp_Counter>`_ returned by the
RDTSC instruction is a suitable clock for single-core CPUs, but on
multiple-core CPUs, different cores may have different values or tick at different speeds, and so it may fail to meet `.req.monotonic`_.
