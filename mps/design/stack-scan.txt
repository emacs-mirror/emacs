Introduction
------------

_`.intro`: This is the design of the stack and register scanning
module.

_`.readership`: Any MPS developer; anyone porting the MPS to a new
platform.

_`.overview`: This module locates and scans references in the control
stack and registers of the *current* thread (the one that has called
in to the MPS).

_`.other`: The thread manager module is responsible for scanning the
control stack and registers of *other* threads. See
design.mps.thread-manager.if.scan_.

.. _design.mps.thread-manager.if.scan: thread-manager#.if.scan

_`.origin`: This design was originally proposed in
mail.richard.2012-08-03.14-36_.

.. _mail.richard.2012-08-03.14-36: https://info.ravenbrook.com/mail/2012/08/03/14-36-35/0/


Requirements
------------

_`.req.stack.hot`: Must locate the hot end of the mutator's stack. (This
is needed for conservative garbage collection of uncooperative code,
where references might be stored by the mutator on its stack.)

_`.req.stack.cold.not`: There is no requirement to locate the cold end
of the stack. (The mutator supplies this as an argument to
``mps_root_create_thread()``.)

_`.req.stack.platform`: Must support the platform's stack
conventions.

_`.req.stack.platform.full-empty`: The implementation must take into
account whether the stack is *full* (the stack pointer points to the
last full location) or *empty* (the stack pointer points to the
first empty location).

_`.req.stack.platform.desc-asc`: The implementation must take into
account whether the stack is *descending* (the hot end of the stack is
at a lower address than the cold end) or *ascending* (the hot end of
the stack is at a higher address than the cold end).

_`.req.registers`: Must locate and scan all references in the
mutator's *root registers*, the subset of registers which might
contain references that do not also appear on the stack. (This is
needed for conservative garbage collection of uncooperative code,
where references might appear in registers.)

_`.req.entry`: Should save the mutator's context (stack and registers)
at the point where it enters the MPS. (This avoids scanning registers
and stack that belong to the MPS rather than the mutator, leading to
unnecessary pinning and zone pollution; see job003525_.)

.. _job003525: https://www.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/issue/job003525/

_`.req.setjmp`: The implementation must follow the C Standard in its
use of the ``setjmp()`` macro. (So that it is reliable and portable.)

_`.req.assembly.not`: The implementation should not use assembly
language. (So that it can be developed in tools like Microsoft Visual
Studio that don't support this.)


Design
------

_`.sol.entry-points`: To meet `.req.entry`_, the mutator's registers
and stack must be recorded when the mutator enters the MPS, if there
is a possibility that the MPS might need to know the mutator context.

_`.sol.entry-points.fragile`: The analysis of which entry points might
need to save the context (see `.anal.entry-points`_ below) is fragile.
It might be incorrect now, or become incomplete if we refactor the
internals of tracing and polling. As a defence against errors of this
form, ``StackScan()`` asserts that the context was saved, but if the
client program continues from the assertion, it saves the context
anyway and continues.

_`.sol.registers`: Implementations spill the root registers onto the
stack so that they can be scanned there.

_`.sol.registers.root`: The *root registers* are the subset of the
callee-save registers that may contain pointers.

_`.sol.registers.root.justify`: The caller-save registers will have
been spilled onto the stack by the time the MPS is entered, so will be
scanned by the stack scan.

_`.sol.setjmp`: The values in callee-save registers can be found by
invoking ``setjmp()``. This forces any of the caller's callee-save
registers into either the ``jmp_buf`` or the current stack frame.

_`.sol.setjmp.scan`: Although we might be able to decode the jump
buffer in a platform-dependent way, it's hard to guarantee that an
uncooperative compiler won't temporarily store a reference in any
register or stack location. We must conservatively scan the whole of
both.

_`.sol.setjmp.justify`: The [C1990]_ standard specifies that
``jmp_buf``:

    is an array type suitable for holding the information needed to
    restore a calling environment. The environment of a call to the
    ``setjmp()`` macro consists of information sufficient for a call
    to the ``longjmp()`` function to return execution to the correct
    block and invocation of that block, were it called recursively.

We believe that any reasonable implementation of ``setjmp()`` must
copy the callee-save registers either into the jump buffer or into the
stack frame that invokes it in order to work as described. Otherwise,
once the callee-save registers have been overwritten by other function
calls, a ``longjmp()`` would result in the callee-save registers
having the wrong values. A ``longjmp()`` can come from anywhere, and
so the function using ``setjmp()`` can't rely on callee-save registers
being saved by callees.

_`.sol.stack.hot`: We could decode the frame of the function that
invokes ``setjmp()`` from the jump buffer in a platform-specific way,
but we can do something simpler (if more hacky) by calling the stub
function ``StackHot()`` which takes the address of its argument. So
long as this stub function is not inlined into the caller, then on all
supported platforms this yields a pointer that is pretty much at the
hot end of the frame.

_`.sol.stack.hot.noinline`: The reason that ``StackHot()`` must not be
inlined is that after inlining, the compiler might place ``stackOut``
at a colder stack address than the ``StackContextStruct``, causing the
latter not to be scanned. See `mail.gdr.2018-07-11.09-48`_.

.. _mail.gdr.2018-07-11.09-48: https://info.ravenbrook.com/mail/2018/07/11/09-48-49/0/

_`.sol.stack.nest`: We can take care of scanning the jump buffer
itself by storing it in the same stack frame. That way a scan from the
hot end determined by `.sol.stack.hot`_ to the cold end will contain
all of the roots.

_`.sol.stack.platform`: As of version 1.115, all supported platforms
are *full* and *descending* so the implementation in ``StackScan()``
assumes this. New platforms must check this assumption.

_`.sol.xc.alternative`: On macOS, we could use ``getcontext()`` from
libunwind (see here_), but that produces deprecation warnings and
introduces a dependency on that library.

Analysis
--------

_`.anal.setjmp`: The [C1990]_ standard says:

    An invocation of the ``setjmp`` macro shall appear only in one of
    the following contexts:

    - the entire controlling expression of a selection or iteration
      statement;

    - one operand of a relational or equality operator with the other
      operand an integral constant expression, with the resulting
      expression being the entire controlling expression of a
      selection or iteration statement;

    - the operand of a unary ``!`` operator with the resulting
      expression being the entire controlling expression of a
      selection or iteration statement; or

    - the entire expression of an expression statement (possibly cast
      to ``void``).

And the [C1999]_ standard adds:

    If the invocation appears in any other context, the behavior is
    undefined.

_`.anal.entry-points`: Here's a reverse call graph (in the master
sources at changelevel 189652) showing which entry points might call
``StackScan()`` and so need to record the stack context::

    StackScan
     └ThreadScan
       └RootScan
         ├traceScanRootRes
         │ └traceScanRoot
         │   └rootFlip
         │     └traceFlip
         │       └TraceStart
         │         ├PolicyStartTrace
         │         │ └TracePoll
         │         │   ├ArenaStep
         │         │   │ └mps_arena_step
         │         │   └ArenaPoll
         │         │     ├mps_alloc
         │         │     ├mps_ap_fill
         │         │     ├mps_ap_fill_with_reservoir_permit
         │         │     ├mps_ap_alloc_pattern_end
         │         │     ├mps_ap_alloc_pattern_reset
         │         │     └ArenaRelease
         │         │       ├mps_arena_release
         │         │       └ArenaStartCollect
         │         │         ├mps_arena_start_collect
         │         │         └ArenaCollect
         │         │           └mps_arena_collect
         │         └TraceStartCollectAll
         │           ├ArenaStep [see above]
         │           ├ArenaStartCollect [see above]
         │           └PolicyStartTrace [see above]
         └rootsWalk
           └ArenaRootsWalk
             └mps_arena_roots_walk

So the entry points that need to save the stack context are
``mps_arena_step()``, ``mps_alloc()``, ``mps_ap_fill()``,
``mps_ap_fill_with_reservoir_permit()``,
``mps_ap_alloc_pattern_end()``, ``mps_ap_alloc_pattern_reset()``,
``mps_arena_release()``, ``mps_arena_start_collect()``,
``mps_arena_collect()``, and ``mps_arena_roots_walk()``.


Interface
---------

``typedef StackContextStruct *StackContext``

_`.if.sc`: A structure encapsulating the mutator context.

``Res StackScan(ScanState ss, void *stackCold, mps_area_scan_t scan_area, void *closure)``

_`.if.scan`: Scan the stack of the current thread, between
``stackCold`` and the hot end of the mutator's stack that was recorded
by ``STACK_CONTEXT_SAVE()`` when the arena was entered. This will
include any roots which were in the mutator's callee-save registers on
entry to the MPS (see `.sol.setjmp`_ and `.sol.stack.nest`_). Return
``ResOK`` if successful, or another result code if not.

_`.if.scan.begin-end`: This function must be called between
``STACK_CONTEXT_BEGIN()`` and ``STACK_CONTEXT_END()``.

``STACK_CONTEXT_SAVE(StackContext sc)``

_`.if.save`: Store the mutator context in the structure ``sc``.

_`.if.save.macro`: This must be implemented as a macro because it
needs to run in the stack frame of the entry point (if it runs in some
other function it does not necessarily get the mutator's registers).
This necessity to have the definition in scope in ``mpsi.c``, while
also having different definitions on different platforms, requires a
violation of design.mps.config.no-spaghetti_ in ss.h.

.. _design.mps.config.no-spaghetti: config#.no-spaghetti

``STACK_CONTEXT_BEGIN(Arena arena)``

_`.if.begin`: Start an MPS operation that may need to know the mutator
context (see `.sol.entry-points`_). This macro must be used like this::

    Res res;
    ArenaEnter(arena);
    STACK_CONTEXT_BEGIN(arena) {
      res = ArenaStartCollect(...);
    } STACK_CONTEXT_END(arena);
    ArenaLeave(arena);
    return res;

That is, it must be paired with ``STACK_CONTEXT_END()``, and there
must be no ``return`` between the two macro invocations.

This macro stores the mutator context in a ``StackContext`` structure
allocated on the stack, and sets ``arena->stackWarm`` to the hot end
of the current frame (using `.sol.stack.hot`_).

``STACK_CONTEXT_END(Arena arena)``

_`.if.end`: Finish the MPS operation that was started by
``STACK_CONTEXT_BEGIN()``.

This macro sets ``arena->stackWarm`` to ``NULL``.


Implementations
---------------

_`.impl`: Generic implementation of ``StackScan()`` in ``ss.c`` scans
the whole area between ``arena->stackWarm`` and the cold end of the
mutator's stack, implementing `.sol.stack.nest`_ and also the backup
strategy in `.sol.entry-points.fragile`_.
