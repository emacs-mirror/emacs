Introduction
------------

_`.intro`: This is the design of the MVFF (Manual Variable First-Fit)
pool class. This pool implements a first (or last) fit policy for
variable-sized manually-managed objects, with control over first/last,
segment preference high/low, and slot fit low/high.

The pool was created in a response to a belief that the ScriptWorks
EPDL/EPDR's first fit policy is beneficial for some classes of client
behaviour, but the performance of a linear free list was unacceptable.


Overview
--------

_`.over`: This pool implements certain variants of the address-ordered
first-fit policy. The implementation allows allocation across segment
boundaries.

_`.over.buffer`: Buffered allocation is also supported, but in that
case, the buffer-filling policy is worst-fit. Buffered and unbuffered
allocation can be used at the same time, but in that case, the first
ap must be created before any allocations.

_`.over.buffer.class`: The pool uses the simplest buffer class,
BufferClass. This is appropriate since these buffers don't attach to
segments, and hence don't constrain buffered regions to lie within
segment boundaries.

_`.over.segments`: The pool uses the simplest segment class
(SegClass). There's no need for anything more complex.


Methods
-------

_`.method`: The MVFF pool supports the following methods:

``Res MVFFInit(Pool pool, Args arg)``

_`.method.init`: This takes six `keyword arguments`_:

.. _`keyword arguments`: keyword-arguments

================================== ============================================
Keyword argument                   Description
================================== ============================================
``MPS_KEY_EXTEND_BY``              The segment size.
``MPS_KEY_MEAN_SIZE``              The average object size.
``MPS_KEY_ALIGN``                  The alignment of allocations and frees.
                                   Must be at least ``sizeof(void *)``.
``MPS_KEY_MVFF_SLOT_HIGH``         Whether to allocate objects at the end of 
                                   free blocks found, as opposed to at
                                   the start (for unbuffered
                                   allocation).
``MPS_KEY_MVFF_ARENA_HIGH``        Whether to express ``SegPrefHIGH``
                                   to the arena, as opposed to
                                   ``SegPrefLOW``.
``MPS_KEY_MVFF_FIRST_FIT``         whether to use the suitable block of lowest
                                   address, as opposed to the highest
                                   (for unbuffered allocation)
================================== ============================================

_`.method.init.epdl`: To simulate the EPDL pool, specify ``extendBy``,
``avgSize``, and ``maxSize`` as normal, and use ``slotHigh=FALSE``,
``arenaHigh=FALSE``, ``firstFit=TRUE``.

_`.method.init.epdr`: To simulate the EPDR pool, specify ``extendBy``,
``avgSize``, and ``maxSize`` as normal, and use ``slotHigh=TRUE``,
``arenaHigh=TRUE``, ``firstFit=TRUE``.

_`.method.init.other`: The performance characteristics of other
combinations are unknown.

_`.method.finish`: The ``PoolFinish()`` method,

_`.method.alloc`: ``PoolAlloc()`` and ``PoolFree()`` methods are
supported, implementing the policy set by the pool params (see
`.method.init`_).

_`.method.describe`: The usual describe method.

_`.method.buffer`: The buffer methods implement a worst-fit fill
strategy.


External Functions
------------------

_`.function`: MVFF supports the following external functions:

_`.function.free-size`: ``mps_mvff_free_size()`` returns the total
size of free space in segments allocated to the MVFF pool instance.

_`.function.size`: ``mps_mvff_size()`` returns the total memory used
by pool segments, whether free or allocated.

_`.function.class`: ``mps_class_mvff()`` returns the class object for
the pool class, to be used in pool creation.


Implementation
--------------

_`.impl.free-list`: The pool stores its free list in a CBS (see
`design.mps.cbs <cbs/>`_). It uses the CBS's mayUseInline facility to
avoid running out of memory to store the free list. This is the reason
for the alignment restriction above.


Details
-------

_`.design.seg-size`: When adding a segment, we use extendBy as the
segment size unless the object won't fit, in which case we use the
object size (in both cases we align up).

_`.design.seg-fail`: If allocating a segment fails, we try again with
a segment size just large enough for the object we're allocating. This
is in response to `request.mps.170186`_.

Document History
----------------

- 1998-09-09 Gavin Matthews. Wrote a list of methods and function plus
  some notes.

- 1999-01-06 Pekka P. Pirinen. Added overview, removed bogus
  ``ArenaEnter`` design, and described buffered allocation.

- Modified for the "Sunset On Segments" redesign of segments. Buffered
  allocation is no longer limited to segment boundaries.

- 2002-06-07 RB_ Converted from MMInfo database design document.

- 2013-05-10 RB_ Converted to reStructuredText. Updated to document
  keyword arguments, replacing varargs.
