      DESIGN OF THE MANUALLY-MANAGED VARIABLE-SIZE FIRST-FIT POOL

INTRODUCTION

<a id="intro" name="intro">.intro</a>: The pool was created in a response to a belief that EPDL/EPDR's first 
fit policy is beneficial for some classes of client behaviour, but the 
performance of a linear free list was unacceptable.  This pool implements a 
first (or last) fit policy for variable-sized manually-managed objects, with 
control over first/last, segment preference high/low, and slot fit low/high.


Document History

<a id="hist.0" name="hist.0">.hist.0</a>: GavinM wrote a list of methods and function plus some notes 1998-09-09.

<a id="hist.1" name="hist.1">.hist.1</a>: Added overview, removed bogus ArenaEnter design, and described 
buffered allocation.  pekka 1999-01-06

<a id="hist.2" name="hist.2">.hist.2</a>: Modified for the "Sunset On Segments" redesign of segments. Buffered 
allocation is no longer limited to segment boundaries.

OVERVIEW

<a id="over" name="over">.over</a>: This pool implements certain variants of the address-ordered first-fit 
policy.  The implementation allows allocation across segment boundaries.  
<a id="over.buffer" name="over.buffer">.over.buffer</a>: Buffered allocation is also supported, but in that case, the 
buffer-filling policy is worst-fit.  Buffered and unbuffered allocation can be 
used at the same time, but in that case, the first ap must be created before 
any allocations. <a id="over.buffer.class" name="over.buffer.class">.over.buffer.class</a>: The pool uses the simplest buffer class, 
BufferClass. This is appropriate since these buffers don't attach to segments, 
and hence don't constrain buffered regions to lie within segment boundaries. 
<a id="over.segments" name="over.segments">.over.segments</a>: The pool uses the simplest segment class (SegClass). There's no 
need for anything more complex.


METHODS

<a id="method" name="method">.method</a>: The MVFF pool supports the following methods:

<a id="method.init" name="method.init">.method.init</a>: Res MVFFInit(Pool pool, va_list arg) 
  This takes six vararg parameters:
  - extendBy -- the segment size;
  - avgSize -- the average object size;
  - alignment -- the alignment of allocations and frees (must be at least 
sizeof(void*));
  - slotHigh -- whether to allocate objects at the end of free blocks found, as 
opposed to at the start (for unbuffered allocation);
  - arenaHigh -- whether to express SegPrefHIGH to the arena, as opposed to 
SegPrefLOW;
  - firstFit -- whether to use the suitable block of lowest address, as opposed 
to the highest (for unbuffered allocation).
<a id="method.init.epdl" name="method.init.epdl">.method.init.epdl</a>: To simulate the EPDL pool, specify extendBy, avgSize, and 
maxSize as normal, and use slotHigh=FALSE, arenaHigh=FALSE, firstFit=TRUE.  
<a id="method.init.epdr" name="method.init.epdr">.method.init.epdr</a>: To simulate the EPDL pool, specify extendBy, avgSize, and 
maxSize as normal, and use slotHigh=TRUE, arenaHigh=TRUE, firstFit=TRUE.  
<a id="method.init.other" name="method.init.other">.method.init.other</a>: The performance characteristics of other combinations are 
unknown.

<a id="method.finish" name="method.finish">.method.finish</a>: The PoolFinish method,

<a id="method.alloc" name="method.alloc">.method.alloc</a>: Alloc and Free methods are supported, implementing the policy 
set by the pool params (see .method.init).

<a id="method.describe" name="method.describe">.method.describe</a>: The usual describe method.

<a id="method.buffer" name="method.buffer">.method.buffer</a>: The buffer methods implement a worst-fit fill strategy.


EXTERNAL FUNCTIONS

<a id="function" name="function">.function</a>: MVFF supports the following external functions:

<a id="function.free-size" name="function.free-size">.function.free-size</a>: size_t mps_mvff_free_size(mps_pool_t pool)
  This function returns the total size of free space in segments allocated to 
the MVFF pool instance.

<a id="function.size" name="function.size">.function.size</a>: size_t mps_mvff_size(mps_pool_t pool)
  This function returns the total memory used by pool segments, whether free or 
allocated.

<a id="function.class" name="function.class">.function.class</a>: mps_class_t mps_class_mvff(void)
  This function returns the class object for the pool class, to be used in pool 
creation.


IMPLEMENTATION

<a id="impl.free-list" name="impl.free-list">.impl.free-list</a>: The pool stores its free list in a CBS (see design.mps.cbs).  
It uses the CBS's mayUseInline facility to avoid running out of memory to store 
the free this.  This is the reason for the alignment restriction above.



DETAILS

<a id="design.seg-size" name="design.seg-size">.design.seg-size</a>: When adding a segment, we use extendBy as the segment size 
unless the object won't fit, in which case we use the object size (in both 
cases we align up).

<a id="design.seg-fail" name="design.seg-fail">.design.seg-fail</a>: If allocating a segment fails, we try again with a segment 
size just large enough for the object we're allocating.  This is in response to 
request.mps.170186.
