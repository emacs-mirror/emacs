<h2 id="section-1">1. Introduction</h2>

<p>
.scope: This document describes the Ravenbrook conventions for the general format 
of C source code in the MPS.
</p>

<p>
.readership: This document is intended for anyone working on or with the C 
source code.
</p>



<h2 id="section-2">2. General Formatting Conventions</h2>

<h3>Line Width</h3>

<p>
.width: Lines should be no wider than 72 characters. .width.why: Many
people use 80 column terminal windows so that multiple windows can be
placed side by side.  Restricting lines to 72 characters allows line
numbering to be used (in vi for example) and also allows diffs to be
displayed without overflowing the terminal.
</p>


<h3>White Space</h3>

<p>
.space.notab: No tab characters should appear in the source files.  Ordinary 
spaces should be used to indent and format the sources.
.space.notab.why: Tab characters are 
displayed differently on different platforms, and sometimes translated back and 
forth, destroying layout information.
</p>

<p>
.space.punct: There should always be whitespace after commas and semicolons and 
similar punctuation.
</p>

<p>
.space.op: Put white space around operators in expressions, except when 
removing it would make the expression clearer by binding certain 
sub-expressions more tightly.  For example:
</p>

<pre>
  foo = x + y*z;
</pre>

<p>
.space.control.not: No space between the keywords <em>if</em>,
<em>switch</em>, <em>while</em>, <em>for</em> and the following paren.
</p>

<p>
.space.function.not: No space between a function name and the 
following paren beginning its argument list.
</p>



<h3>Sections and Paragraphs</h3>

<p>
.section: Source files can be thought of as breaking down into "sections" and 
"paragraphs".  A section might be the leader comment of a file, the imports, or 
a set of declarations which are related.
</p>

<p>
.section.space: Precede sections by two blank lines (except the first one in 
the file, which should be the leader comment in any case).
</p>

<p>
.section.comment: Each section should start with a banner comment (see 
.comment.banner) describing what the section contains.
</p>

<p>
.para: Within sections, code often breaks down into natural units called 
"paragraphs".  A paragraph might be a set of strongly related declarations 
(Init and Finish, for example), or a few lines of code which it makes sense to 
consider together (the assignment of fields into a structure, for example).
</p>

<p>
.para.space: Precede paragraphs by a single blank line.
</p>


<h3>Statements</h3>

<p>
.statement.one: Generally only have at most one statement per line.  In 
particular the following are deprecated:
</p>

<pre>
  if(thing) return;  

  a=0; b=0;

  case 0: f = inRampMode ? AMCGen0RampmodeFrequency : AMCGen0Frequency;
</pre>

<p>
.statement.one.why: Debuggers can often only place breakpoints on lines, not 
expressions or statements within a line.  The "if(thing) return;" is a 
particularly important case, if thing is a reasonably rare return condition 
then you might want to breakpoint it in a debugger session.  Annoying because
"if(thing) return;" is quite compact and pleasing otherwise.
</p>


<h3>Indentation</h3>

<p>
.indent: Indent the body of a block by two spaces.  
For formatting purposes, the "body of a block" means:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> statements between braces, </li>
  <li> a single statement following a lone if; </li>
  <li> statements in a case-clause; see .switch. </li>
</ul>

<p>
(.indent.logical: The aim is to group what we think of as logical 
blocks, even though they may not exactly match how "block" is used 
in the definition of C syntax).
</p>

<p>
Some examples:
</p>

<pre>
  if(res != ResOK) {
    SegFinish(&amp;span->segStruct);
    PoolFreeP(MV->spanPool, span, sizeof(SpanStruct));
    return res;
  }

  if(res != ResOK)
    goto error;

  if(j == block->base) {
    if(j+step == block->limit) {
      if(block->thing)
        putc('@', stream);
    }
  } else if(j+step == block->limit) {
    putc(']', stream);
    pop_bracket();
  } else {
    putc('.', stream);
  }

  case 'A': {
    c = 'A';
    p += 1;
    break;
  }
</pre>

<p>
.indent.goto-label: Place each goto-label on a line of its own, 
outdented to the same level as the surrounding block.  Then indent 
the non-label part of the statement normally.
</p>

<pre>
  result foo(void)
  {
    statement();
    if(error)
      goto foo;
    statement();
    return OK;

  foo:
    unwind();
    return ERROR;
  }
</pre>

<p>
.indent.case-label.not: Do not outdent case- and default-labels in a 
switch statement.  See .switch.
</p>

<p>
.indent.cont: If an expression or statement won't fit on a single line, 
indent the continuation lines by two spaces, apart from the following 
exception:
</p>

<p>
.indent.cont.parens: if you break a statement inside a parameter list 
or other parenthesized expression, indent so that the continuation 
lines up just after the open parenthesis. For example:
</p>
<pre>
  PoolClassInit(&amp;PoolClassMVStruct,
                "MV", init, finish, allocP, freeP,
                NULL, NULL, describe, isValid);
</pre>

<p>
.indent.cont.expr: Note that when breaking an expression it is clearer 
to place the operator at the start of the continuation line:
</p>

<pre>
  CHECKL(AddrAdd((Addr)chunk->pageTableMapped,
                 BTSize(chunk->pageTablePages))
         &lt;= AddrAdd(chunk->base, chunk->ullageSize));
</pre>

<p>
This is particularly useful in long conditional expressions that use 
&amp;&amp; and ||.  For example:
</p>

<pre>
  } while(trace->state != TraceFINISHED
          &amp;&amp; (trace->emergency || traceWorkClock(trace) &lt; pollEnd));
</pre>

<p>
.indent.hint: 
Usually, it is possible to determine the correct indentation for a line 
by looking to see if the previous line ends with a semicolon.  If it 
does, indent to the same amount, otherwise indent by two more spaces.  
The main exceptions are lines starting with a close brace, goto-labels, 
and line-breaks between parentheses.
</p>


<h3>Positioning of Braces</h3>

<p>
.brace.otb: Use the "One True Brace" (or OTB) style.  
This places the open brace after the control 
word or expression, separated by a space, and when there is an else, 
places that after the close brace.  For example:
</p>

<pre>
  if(isBase) {
    new->base = limit;
    new->limit = block->limit;
    block->limit = base;
    new->next = block->next;
    block->next = new;
  } else {
    new->base = block->base;
    new->limit = base;
    block->base = limit;
    new->next = block;
    *prev = new;
  }
</pre>

<p>
The same applies to struct, enum, union.
</p>

<p>
.brace.otb.function.not: OTB is never used for function definitions.
</p>

<p>
.brace.always: Braces are always required after 
<em>if</em>, <em>else</em>, <em>switch</em>, 
<em>while</em>, <em>do</em>, and <em>for</em>.
</p>

<p>
.brace.always.except: Except that a lone <em>if</em> with no 
<em>else</em> is allowed to drop its braces when its body is a single 
simple statement.  Typically this will be a <em>goto</em> or an 
assignment.  For example:
</p>

<pre>
  if(res != ResOK)
    goto failStart;
</pre>

<p>
Note in particular that an <em>if</em> with an <em>else</em> must have
braces on both paths.
</p>


<h3>Switch Statements</h3>

<p>
.switch: format switch statements like this:
</p>

<pre>
  switch(action) {
    case WIBBLE:
    case WOBBLE: {
      int angle;
      err = move(plate, action, &amp;angle);
      break;
    }
    case QUIESCENT: {
      err = 0;
      break;
    }
    default: {
      NOTREACHED;
      break;
    }
  }
</pre>

<p>
The component rules that result in this style are:
</p>

<p>
.switch.two-levels: The switch statement as a whole is a block, and 
(for formatting purposes) each case- or default-label starts a nested 
block within that.  <strong>Always</strong> use two levels.  Do not 
try to 'save a level' by outdenting case-labels: it's an anachronism 
from when BSD used 8-column indents, and it causes havoc with brace 
positioning.
</p>

<p>
.switch.brace: Put braces around every case-clause body.  Put the open 
brace on the same line as the last case-label (following .brace.otb).  Put 
the close brace on a line on its own.
</p>

<p>
.switch.break: The last line of every case-clause body, before the 
close brace, must be an unconditional jump statement (usually 
<code>break</code>, but may be <code>goto</code>, 
<code>continue</code>, or <code>return</code>), or if a fall-through 
is intended, the comment <code>/* fall-through */</code>.  (Note: if 
the unconditional jump should never be taken, because of previous 
conditional jumps, use <code>NOTREACHED</code> on the line before it).  
This rule is to prevent accidental fall-throughs, even if someone makes a editing mistake that causes a conditional jump to be missed.
</p>

<p>
(.switch.break.outside.not: Do not put the break outside the 
case-clause braces: there is no need.  Placing it on the last line of 
the case-clause body is less weird and equally clear.)
</p>

<p>
.switch.default: It is usually a good idea to have a default-clause, 
even if all it contains is <code>NOTREACHED</code> and 
<code>break</code>.
</p>

<p>
.switch.new-rules: The above rules are simple, consistent, and not 
onerous.  But they are also new, so existing MPS source code may not 
yet follow them.
</p>

<p>
.switch.horrors: There are currently around 5 different formatting 
styles for switch statements in MPS source code: this is madness.  
Variation is mostly caused by inventive violations of 
.switch.two-levels (either case-label outdenting, or something worse: 
see root.c), compounded by inventive violations of OTB for the braces 
around the case-clause.  The following transgressions are deprecated:
</p>

<pre>
  switch(action) {
  case WOBBLE: {   /* BAD: open brace on outdented case-label line! */
    ...
  }  /* BAD: outdented close brace! */

  } break;  /* BAD: break sharing line with close brace! */
</pre>


<h3>Formatting Comments</h3>

<p>
.comment: There are three types of comments: banners, paragraph comments, and 
columnar comments.
</p>

<p>
.comment.banner: Banner comments come at the start of sections.  A banner 
comment consists of a heading usually composed of a symbol, an em-dash (--) and 
an short explanation, followed by English text which is formatted using 
conventional text documentation guidelines (see guide.text).  The open and 
close comment tokens ("/*" and "*/") are placed at the top and bottom of a 
column of asterisks.  The text is separated from the asterisks by one space.  
Place a blank line between the banner comment and the section it comments.  For 
example:
</p>

<pre>
/* BlockStruct --  Block descriptor
 *
 * The pool maintains a descriptor structure for each 
 * contiguous allocated block of memory it manages.  
 * The descriptor is on a simple linked-list of such 
 * descriptors, which is in ascending order of address.
 */

typedef struct BlockStruct {
</pre>

<p>
.comment.para: Paragraph comments come at the start of paragraphs in the code.  
A paragraph comment consists of formatted English text, with each line wrapped 
by the open and close comment tokens ("/*" and "*/").  (This avoids problems 
when cutting and pasting comments.)  For example:
</p>

<pre>
  /* If the freed area is in the base sentinel then insert */
  /* the new descriptor after it, otherwise insert before. */
  if(isBase) {
</pre>

<p>
.comment.para.precede: Paragraph comments, even one-liners, precede the
code to which they apply.
</p>

<p>
.comment.column: Columnar comments appear in a column to the right of the 
code.  They should be used sparingly, since they clutter the code and make it 
hard to edit.  Use them on variable declarations and structure, union, or enum 
declarations.  They should start at least at column 32 (counting from 0,
that is, on a tab-stop), and should be terse 
descriptive text.  Abandon English sentence structure if this makes the comment 
clearer.  Don't write more than one line.  Here's an example:
</p>

<pre>
  typedef struct PoolMVStruct
  {
    Pool blockPool;           /* for block descriptors */
    Pool spanPool;            /* for span descriptors */
    size_t extendBy;          /* size to extend pool by */
    size_t avgSize;           /* estimate of allocation size */
    size_t maxSize;           /* estimate of maximum size */
    Addr space;               /* total free space in pool */
    Addr lost;                /* lost when free can't allocate */
    struct SpanStruct *spans; /* span chain */
  } PoolMVStruct;
</pre>

<h3>Macros</h3>

<p>
.macro.careful: Macros in C are a real horror bag, be extra careful.
There's lots that could go here, but proper coverage probably
deserves a separate document.  Which isn't written yet.
</p>

<p>
.macro.general: 
Do try and follow the other formatting conventions for code
in macro definitions.
</p>

<p>
.macro.backslash:
Backslashes used for continuation lines in macro definitions should be
put on the right somewhere where they will be less in the way.  Example:
</p>

<pre>
#define RAMP_RELATION(X)                       \
  X(RampOUTSIDE,        "outside ramp")        \
  X(RampBEGIN,          "begin ramp")          \
  X(RampRAMPING,        "ramping")             \
  X(RampFINISH,         "finish ramp")         \
  X(RampCOLLECTING,     "collecting ramp")
</pre>
