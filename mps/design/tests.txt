Introduction
------------

_`.intro`: This document contains a guide to the Memory Pool System
tests.

_`.readership`: This document is intended for any MPS developer.


Running tests
-------------

_`.run`: Run these commands::

    cd code
    make -f <makefile> VARIETY=<variety> <target>  # Unix
    nmake /f <makefile> VARIETY=<variety> <target> # Windows

where ``<makefile>`` is the appropriate makefile for the platform (see
`manual/build.txt`_), ``<variety>`` is the variety (see
design.mps.config.var_) and ``<target>`` is the collection of tests
(see `.target`_ below). For example::

    make -f lii6ll VARIETY=cool testrun

If ``<variety>`` is omitted, tests are run in both the cool and hot
varieties.

.. _design.mps.config.var: config#.var
.. _manual/build.txt: https://www.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/master/manual/build.txt


Test targets
------------

_`.target`: The makefiles provide the following targets for common
sets of tests:

_`.target.testall`: The ``testall`` target runs all test cases (even
if known to fail).

_`.target.testrun`: The ``testrun`` target runs the "smoke tests".
This subset of tests are quick checks that the MPS is working. They
run quickly enough for it to be practical to run them every time the
MPS is built.

_`.target.testci`: The ``testci`` target runs the continuous
integration tests, the subset of tests that are expected to pass in
full-featured build configurations.

_`.target.testansi`: The ``testansi`` target runs the subset of the
tests that are expected to pass in the generic ("ANSI") build
configuration (see design.mps.config.opt.ansi_).

_`.target.testpollnone`: The ``testpollnone`` target runs the subset
of the tests that are expected to pass in the generic ("ANSI") build
configuration (see design.mps.config.opt.ansi_) with the option
``CONFIG_POLL_NONE`` (see design.mps.config.opt.poll_).

.. _design.mps.config.opt.ansi: config#.opt.ansi
.. _design.mps.config.opt.poll: config#.opt.poll

_`.target.testratio`: The ``testratio`` target compares the
performance of the HOT and RASH varieties. See `.ratio`_.

_`.target.testscheme`: The ``testscheme`` target builds the example
Scheme interpreter (example/scheme) and runs its test suite.

_`.target.testmmqa`: The ``testmmqa`` target runs the tests in the
MMQA test suite. See `.mmqa`_.


Test features
-------------

_`.randomize`: Each time a test case is run, it randomly chooses some
of its parameters (for example, the sizes of objects, or how many
links to create in a graph of references). This allows a fast test
to cover many cases over time.

_`.randomize.seed`: The random numbers are chosen pseudo-randomly
based on a seed initialized from environmental data (the time and the
processor cycle count). The seed is reported at test startup, for
example::

    code$ xci6ll/cool/apss
    xci6ll/cool/apss: randomize(): choosing initial state (v3): 2116709187.
    ...
    xci6ll/cool/apss: Conclusion: Failed to find any defects.

Here, the number 2116709187 is the random seed.

_`.randomize.specific-seed` Each test can be run with a specified seed
by passing the seed on the command line, for example::

    code$ xci6ll/cool/apss 2116709187
    xci6ll/cool/apss: randomize(): resetting initial state (v3) to: 2116709187.
    ...
    xci6ll/cool/apss: Conclusion: Failed to find any defects.

_`.randomize.repeatable`: This ensures that the single-threaded tests
are repeatable. (Multi-threaded tests are not repeatable even if the
same seed is used; see job003719_.)

.. _job003719: https://www.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/issue/job003719/


Test list
---------

See `manual/code-index`_ for the full list of automated test cases.

.. _manual/code-index: https://www.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/master/manual/html/code-index.html

_`.test.finalcv`: Registers objects for finalization, makes them
unreachable, deregisters them, etc. Churns to provoke minor (nursery)
collection.

_`.test.finaltest`: Creates a large binary tree, and registers every
node. Drops the top reference, requests collection, and counts the
finalization messages.

_`.test.zcoll`: Collection scheduling, and collection feedback.

_`.test.zmess`: Message lifecycle and finalization messages.


Test database
-------------

_`.db`: The automated tests are described in the test database
(tool/testcases.txt).

_`.db.format`: This is a self-documenting plain-text database which
gives for each test case its name and an optional set of features. For
example the feature ``=P`` means that the test case requires polling
to succeed, and therefore is expected to fail in build configurations
without polling (see design.mps.config.opt.poll_).

_`.db.format.simple`: The format must be very simple because the test
runner on Windows is written as a batch file (.bat), in order to avoid
having to depend on any tools that are did not come as standard with
Windows XP, and batch files are inflexible. (But note that we no
longer support Windows XP, so it would now be possible to rewrite the
test runner in PowerShell if we thought that made sense.)

_`.db.testrun`: The test runner (tool/testrun.sh on Unix or
tool/testrun.bat on Windows) parses the test database to work out
which tests to run according to the target. For example the
``testpollnone`` target must skip all test cases with the ``P``
feature.


Test runner
-----------

_`.runner.req.automated`: The test runner must execute without user
interaction, so that it can be used for continuous integration.

_`.runner.req.output.pass`: Test cases are expected to pass nearly all the
time, and in these cases we almost never want to see the output, so
the test runner must suppress the output for passing tests.

_`.runner.req.output.fail`: However, if a test case fails then the
test runner must preserve the output from the failing test, including
the random seed (see `.randomize.seed`_), so that this can be analyzed
and the test repeated. Moreover, it must print the output from the
failing test, so that if the test is being run on a continuous
integration system like Travis, then the output of the failing tests
is included in the failure report. (See job003489_.)

.. _job003489: https://www.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/issue/job003489/


Performance test
----------------

_`.ratio`: The ``testratio`` target checks that the hot variety
is not too much slower than the rash variety. A failure of this test
usually is expected to indicate that there are assertions on the
critical path using ``AVER`` instead of ``AVER_CRITICAL`` (and so on).
This works by running gcbench for the AMC pool class and djbench for
the MVFF pool class, in the hot variety and the rash variety,
computing the ratio of CPU time taken in the two varieties, and
testing that this falls under an acceptable limit.

_`.ratio.cpu-time`: Note that we use the CPU time (reported by
``/usr/bin/time``) and not the elapsed time (as reported by the
benchmark) because we want to be able to run this test on continuous
integration machines that might be heavily loaded.

_`.ratio.platform`: This target is currently supported only on Unix
platforms using GNU Makefiles.


Adding a new test
-----------------

To add a new test to the MPS, carry out the following steps. (The
procedure uses the name "newtest" throughout but you should of
course replace this with the name of your test case.)

_`.new.source`: Create a C source file in the code directory,
typically named "newtest.c". In additional to the usual copyright
boilerplate, it should contain a call to ``testlib_init()`` (this
ensures reproducibility of pseudo-random numbers), and a ``printf()``
reporting the absence of defects (this output is recognized by the
test runner)::

    #include <stdio.h>
    #include "testlib.h"

    int main(int argc, char *argv[])
    {
      testlib_init(argc, argv);
      /* test happens here */
      printf("%s: Conclusion: Failed to find any defects.\n", argv[0]);
      return 0;
    }

_`.new.unix`: If the test case builds on the Unix platforms (FreeBSD,
Linux and macOS), edit code/comm.gmk adding the test case to the
``TEST_TARGETS`` macro, and adding a rule describing how to build it,
typically::

    $(PFM)/$(VARIETY)/newtest: $(PFM)/$(VARIETY)/newtest.o \
            $(TESTLIBOBJ) $(PFM)/$(VARIETY)/mps.a

_`.new.windows`: If the test case builds on Windows, edit
code/commpre.nmk adding the test case to the ``TEST_TARGETS`` macro,
and edit code/commpost.nmk adding a rule describing how to build it,
typically::

    $(PFM)\$(VARIETY)\newtest.exe: $(PFM)\$(VARIETY)\newtest.obj \
            $(PFM)\$(VARIETY)\mps.lib $(FMTTESTOBJ) $(TESTLIBOBJ)

_`.new.macos`: If the test case builds on macOS, open
code/mps.xcodeproj/project.pbxproj for edit and open this project in
Xcode. If the project navigator is not visible at the left, select
View → Navigators → Show Project Navigator (⌘1). Right click on the
Tests folder and choose Add Files to "mps"…. Select code/newtest.c
and then click Add. Move the new file into alphabetical order in the
Tests folder. Click on "mps" at the top of the project navigator to
reveal the targets. Select a test target that is similar to the one
you have just created. Right click on that target and select Duplicate
(⌘D). Select the new target and change its name to "newtest". Select
the "Build Phases" tab and check that "Dependencies" contains the mps
library, and that "Compile Sources" contains newtest.c and
testlib.c. Close the project.

_`.new.database`: Edit tool/testcases.txt and add the new test case to
the database. Use the appropriate flags to indicate the properties of
the test case. These flags are used by the test runner to select the
appropriate sets of test cases. For example tests marked ``=P`` are
expected to fail in build configurations without polling (see
design.mps.config.opt.poll_).

_`.new.manual`: Edit manual/source/code-index.rst and add the new test
case to the "Automated test cases" section.


Continuous integration
----------------------

_`.ci`: The MPS uses the following systems for continuous integration:

_`.ci.travis`: The commercial Travis_ continuous integration service
runs ``./configure && make install && make test`` (which exercises the
``testci`` target for platforms lii6gc, lii6ll, xci6ll, and
``testansi`` and ``testpollnone`` for platforms anangc and ananll)
whenever there is a commit to the `mps GitHub repository`_. See the
`Ravenbrook/mps`_ project on Travis for a build history.

.. _mps GitHub repository: https://github.com/ravenbrook/mps
.. _Travis: https://travis-ci.org
.. _Ravenbrook/mps: https://travis-ci.org/Ravenbrook/mps

_`.ci.travis.config`: Travis is configured using the .travis.yml file
at top level of the project.

_`.ci.jenkins`: An instance of Jenkins_ running on "gannet" (a Windows
PC at the Ravenbrook office) runs the ``testci`` target on platforms
w3i3mv and w3i6mv whenever there is a commit to the `mps GitHub
repository`_.

.. _Jenkins: https://jenkins.io

_`.ci.jenkins.config`: There are instructions for installing and
configuring Jenkins in [GDR_2016-04-14]_, [GDR_2016-04-15]_ and
[GDR_2016-04-20]_.


MMQA tests
----------

_`.mmqa`: The Memory Management Quality Assurance test suite is
another suite of test cases.

_`.mmqa.why`: The existence of two test suites originates in the
departmental structure at Harlequin Ltd where the MPS was originally
developed. Tests written by members of the Memory Management Group
went into the code directory along with the MPS itself, while tests
written by members of the Quality Assurance Group went into the test
directory. (Conway's Law states that "organizations which design
systems … are constrained to produce designs which are copies of the
communication structures of these organizations" [Conway_1968]_.)

_`.mmqa.run`: See test/README for how to run the MMQA tests.


Other tests
-----------

_`.coverage`: The program tool/testcoverage compiles the MPS with
coverage enabled, runs the smoke tests (`.target.testrun`_) and
outputs a coverage report.

_`.opendylan`: The program tool/testopendylan pulls Open Dylan from
GitHub and builds it against the MPS.
