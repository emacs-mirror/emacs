:Index terms:   pair: ANSI fake VM; design


_`.intro`: The ANSI fake VM is an implementation of the MPS VM
interface (see design.mps.vm) using services provided by the ANSI C
Library (standard.ansic.7) -- ``malloc()`` and ``free()``, as it
happens.

_`.align`: The VM is aligned to ``VMAN_ALIGN`` (defined in
impl.h.mpmconf) by adding ``VMAN_ALIGN`` to the requested size,
allocating a block that large using ``malloc()``, then rounding the
pointer to the base of the block. ``vm->base`` is the aligned pointer,
``vm->block`` is the pointer returned by ``malloc()``, which is used
in ``VMDestroy()``.
