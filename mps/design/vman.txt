:Index terms:   pair: ANSI fake VM; design


_`.intro`: The ANSI fake VM is an implementation of the MPS VM
interface (see design.mps.vm_) using only services provided by the
ANSI C Library (standard.ansic.7).

.. _design.mps.vm: vm

_`.page.size`: The VM uses a fake page size, given by the constant
``VMAN_PAGE_SIZE`` in ``config.h``.

_`.align`: The VM is aligned to the arena grain size by adding the
grain size to the requested size, allocating a block that large using
``malloc()``, then rounding the pointer to the block up to a multiple
of the grain size and storing the result in ``vm->base``. The block is
stored in ``vm->block``, which is passed to ``free()`` in
``VMFinish()``.
