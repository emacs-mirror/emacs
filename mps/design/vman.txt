Introduction
------------

_`.intro`: The generic virtual mapping module implements the virtual
mapping interface (see design.mps.vm_) using only services provided by
the Standard C Library (standard.ansic.7).

.. _design.mps.vm: vm

_`.readership`: Any MPS developer.


Design
------

_`.page.size`: The generic VM uses a fake page size, given by the
constant ``VMAN_PAGE_SIZE`` in ``config.h``.

_`.reserve`: Address space is "reserved" by calling ``malloc()``.

_`.release`: Address space is "released" by calling ``free()``.

_`.map`: Mapping (and unmapping) fills the mapped region with copies
of ``VMJunkBYTE`` to emulate the erasure of freshly mapped pages by
virtual memory systems.
