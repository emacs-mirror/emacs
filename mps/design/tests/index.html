<h1> <a id="guide">Guide</a> </h1>

<p> Readership: any MPS developer.  Not confidential. </p>

<h2> zmess.c </h2>

<p>Tests message lifecycle, and finalization (by using finalization messages).</p>


<h2> zcoll.c </h2>

<p>Tests collection scheduling, and collection feedback.</p>


<h2> Finalization Tests </h2>

<p>There are three main ones:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>finalcv.c</dt>
  <dd>Oldest.  Registers a few objects (for finalization) and pseudorandomly makes them unreachable, deregisters them, etc.  Churns to provoke minor (nursery) collection.</dd>
  <dt>finaltest.c</dt>
  <dd>Uses newer fmtdytst facilities.  Creates a large binary tree, and registers every node.  Drops top ref, requests collection, and counts the messages.</dd>
  <dt>fin1658a.c  -- deleted</dt>
  <dd>[Subsumed into and replaced by zmess.c, 2009-02-17].  fin1658a.c was a single-issue test: see job001658.  Drops refs and requests collection.  Verifies that all non-E-reachable registered objects are finalized in a single collection, even if there are >1 segs of poolmrg guardians.</dd>
</dl>

<p>There's also expt825.c, which verifies that protection expose/remember works correctly for poolmrg (scanned but not GC'd segs); see job000825.</p>
