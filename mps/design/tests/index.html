<p>This document contains a <a href="#guide">guide</a> to the MPS Internal Tests.  There is no historical initial design, but there is a placeholder for early ideas and discussions: <a href="#initial-ideas">initial ideas</a>.

<h2> Finalization Tests </h2>

<p>There are three main ones:</p>
<dl>
  <dt>finalcv.c</dt>
  <dd>Oldest.  Registers a few objects (for finalization) and pseudorandomly makes them unreachable, deregisters them, etc.  Churns to provoke minor (nursery) collection.</dd>
  <dt>finaltest.c</dt>
  <dd>Uses newer fmtdytst facilities.  Creates a large binary tree, and registers every node.  Drops top ref, requests collection, and counts the messages.</dd>
  <dt>fin1658a.c</dt>
  <dd>Newest.  Single-issue test: see job001658.  Drops refs and requests collection.  Verifies that all non-E-reachable registered objects are finalized in a single collection, even if there are >1 segs of poolmrg guardians.</dd>
</dl>

<p>There's also expt825.c, which verifies that protection expose/remember works correctly for poolmrg (scanned but not GC'd segs); see job000825.</p>

<h1> <a id="initial-ideas">Initial Ideas</a> </h1>

<p>There never was an initial design document.  This is a placeholder for links to early ideas and discussions.</p>
