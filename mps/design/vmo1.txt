.. warning::

    As of 2013-05-26, the MPS is no longer supported on Digital Unix,
    so this document is only of historical interest.


Introduction
------------

_`.readership`: Any MPS developer.

_`.intro`: This is the design of the VM Module for Digital UNIX (also
known as OSF/1 and Tru64 Unix; see os.o1). In general aspects
(including interface) the design is as for design.mps.vm.


Functions
---------

_`.fun.unmap`: ``VMUnmap()`` "unmaps" a region by replacing the
existing mapping with a mapping using the ``vm->none_fd`` file
descriptor (see mumble mumble, ``VMCreate()``), and protection set to
``PROT_NONE`` (that is, no access).

_`.fun.unmap.justify`: Replacing the mapping in this way means that
the address space is still reserved and will not be used by calls to
``mmap()`` (perhaps in other libraries) which specify
``MAP_VARIABLE``.

_`.fun.unmap.offset`: The offset for this mapping is the offset of the
region being unmapped in the VM; this gives the same effect as if
there was one mapping of the ``vm->none_fd`` from the base to the
limit of the VM (but "behind" all the other mappings that have been
created).

_`.fun.unmap.offset.justify`: If this is not done (if for example the
offset is always specified as 0) then the VM will cause the kernel to
create a new file reference for each mapping created with
``VMUnmap()``; eventually the kernel refuses the ``mmap()`` call because it
can't create a new file reference.
