INTRODUCTION

<a id="intro" name="intro">.intro</a>: This document is the design of the MPS Library Interface, a part of the 
plinth.

<a id="readership" name="readership">.readership</a>: Any MPS developer.  Any clients that are prepared to read this in 
order to get documentation.


GOALS

<a id="goal" name="goal">.goal</a>: The goals of the MPS library interface are:

<a id="goal.host" name="goal.host">.goal.host</a>: To control the dependency of the MPS on the hosted ISO C library so 
that the core MPS remains freestanding (see design.mps.exec-env).

<a id="goal.free" name="goal.free">.goal.free</a>: To allow the core MPS convenient access to ISO C functionality that 
is provided on freestanding platforms (see design.mps.exec-env.std.com.free).


DESCRIPTION


Overview

<a id="overview.access" name="overview.access">.overview.access</a>: The core MPS needs to access functionality that could be 
provided by an ISO C hosted environment.

<a id="overview.hosted" name="overview.hosted">.overview.hosted</a>: The core MPS must not make direct use of any facilities in 
the hosted environment (design.mps.exec-env).  However, it is sensible to make 
use of them when the MPS is deployed in a hosted environment.

<a id="overview.hosted.indirect" name="overview.hosted.indirect">.overview.hosted.indirect</a>: The core MPS does not make any direct use of hosted 
ISO C library facilities.  Instead, it indirects through the MPS Library 
Interface, impl.h.mpslib.

<a id="overview.free" name="overview.free">.overview.free</a>: The core MPS can make direct use of freestanding ISO C library 
facilities and does not need to include any of the header files &lt;limits.h&gt;, 
&lt;stdarg.h&gt;, and &lt;stddef.h&gt; directly.

<a id="overview.complete" name="overview.complete">.overview.complete</a>: The MPS Library Interface can be considered as the complete 
"interface to ISO" (in that it provides direct access to facilities that we get 
in a freestanding environment and equivalents of any functionality we require 
from the hosted environment).

<a id="overview.provision.client" name="overview.provision.client">.overview.provision.client</a>: In a freestanding environment the client is 
expected to provide functions meeting this interface to the MPS.

<a id="overview.provision.hosted" name="overview.provision.hosted">.overview.provision.hosted</a>: In a hosted environment, impl.c.mpsliban may be 
used.  It just maps impl.h.mpslib directly onto the ISO C library equivalents.

Outside the Interface

We provide impl.c.mpsliban to the client, for two reasons:

  1. he can use it to connect the MPS to the ISO C library if it exists,

  2. as an example of an implementation of the MPS Library Interface.


IMPLEMENTATION

<a id="impl" name="impl">.impl</a>: The MPS Library Interface comprises a header file impl.h.mpslib 
(mpslib.h) and some documentation.

<a id="impl.decl" name="impl.decl">.impl.decl</a>: The header file defines the interface to definitions which parallel 
those parts of the non-freestanding ISO headers which are used by the MPS.

<a id="impl.include" name="impl.include">.impl.include</a>: The header file also includes the freestanding headers 
&lt;limits.h&gt;, &lt;stdarg.h&gt;, and &lt;stddef.h&gt; (and not &lt;float.h&gt;, though perhaps it 
should).


NOTES

<a id="doc" name="doc">.doc</a>: User doc in doc.mps.guide.interface and doc.mps.guide.appendix-plinth.
