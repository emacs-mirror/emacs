         THE DESIGN OF A NEW MANUAL-VARIABLE MEMORY POOL CLASS
                           design.mps.poolmv2

INTRODUCTION:

This is a second-generation design for a pool that manually manages 
variable-sized objects. It is intended as a replacement for poolmv (except in 
its control pool role) and poolepdl, and it is intended to satisfy the 
requirements of the Dylan "misc" pool and the product malloc/new drop-in 
replacement.

<a id="abbr.abq" name="abbr.abq">.abbr.abq</a>: ABQ = Available Block Queue

<a id="abbr.ap" name="abbr.ap">.abbr.ap</a>: AP = Allocation Point

<a id="abbr.cbs" name="abbr.cbs">.abbr.cbs</a>: CBS = Coalescing Block Structure

OVERVIEW:

mv2 is intended to satisfy the requirements of the clients that need 
manual-variable pools, improving on the performance of the existing 
manual-variable pool implementations, and reducing the duplication of code that 
currently exists. The expected clients of mv2 are: Dylan (currently for its 
misc pool), EP (particularly the dl pool, but all pools other than the PS 
object pool), and Product (initially the malloc/new pool, but also other manual 
pool classes).


REQUIREMENTS:

<a id="req.cat" name="req.cat">.req.cat</a>: Requirements are categorized per guide.req(2).

<a id="req.risk" name="req.risk">.req.risk</a>: req.epcore(16) is known to be obsolete, but the revised document has 
not yet been accepted.


Critical Requirements

<a id="req.fun.man-var" name="req.fun.man-var">.req.fun.man-var</a>: The pool class must support manual allocation and freeing of 
variable-sized blocks (source: req.dylan.fun.misc.alloc, 
req.epcore.fun.{dl,gen,tmp,stat,cache,trap}.{alloc,free}, 
req.product.fun.{malloc,new,man.man}).

<a id="non-req.fun.gc" name="non-req.fun.gc">.non-req.fun.gc</a>: There is not a requirement that the pool class support 
formatted objects, scanning, or collection objects; but it should not be 
arbitrarily precluded.

<a id="req.fun.align" name="req.fun.align">.req.fun.align</a>: The pool class must support aligned allocations to 
client-specified alignments.  An individual instance need only support a single 
alignment; multiple instances may be used to support more than one alignment 
(source: req.epcore.attr.align).

<a id="req.fun.reallocate" name="req.fun.reallocate">.req.fun.reallocate</a>: The pool class must support resizing of allocated blocks 
(source req.epcore.fun.dl.promise.free, req.product.dc.env.{ansi-c,cpp}).

<a id="non-req.fun.reallocate.in-place" name="non-req.fun.reallocate.in-place">.non-req.fun.reallocate.in-place</a>: There is not a requirement blocks must be 
resized in place (where possible); but it seems like a good idea.

<a id="req.fun.thread" name="req.fun.thread">.req.fun.thread</a>: Each instance of the pool class must support multiple threads 
of allocation (source req.epcore.fun.dl.multi, req.product.dc.env.{ansi-c,cpp}).

<a id="req.attr.performance" name="req.attr.performance">.req.attr.performance</a>: The pool class must meet or exceed performance of 
"competitive" allocators (source: rec.epcore.attr.{run-time,tp}, 
req.product.attr.{mkt.eval, perform}).  [Dylan does not seem to have any 
requirement that storage be allocated with a particular response time or 
throughput, just so long as we don't block for too long. Clearly there is a 
missing requirement.]

<a id="req.attr.performance.time" name="req.attr.performance.time">.req.attr.performance.time</a>: By inference, the time overhead must be competetive.

<a id="req.attr.performance.space" name="req.attr.performance.space">.req.attr.performance.space</a>: By inference, the space overhead must be 
competetive.

<a id="req.attr.reliability" name="req.attr.reliability">.req.attr.reliability</a>: The pool class must have "rock-solid reliability" 
(source: req.dylan.attr.rel.mtbf, req.epcore.attr.rel, req.product.attr.rel).

<a id="req.fun.range" name="req.fun.range">.req.fun.range</a>: The pool class must be able to manage blocks ranging in size 
from 1 byte to all of addressable memory 
(req.epcore.attr.{dl,gen,tmp,stat,cache,trap}.obj.{min,max}.  The range 
requirement may be satisfied by multiple instances each managing a particular 
client-specified subrange of sizes.  [Dylan has requirements 
req.dylan.attr.{capacity,obj.max}, but no requirement that such objects reside 
in a manual pool.] 

<a id="req.fun.debug" name="req.fun.debug">.req.fun.debug</a>: The pool class must support debugging erroneous usage by client 
programs (source: req.epcore.fun.{dc.variety, debug.support}, 
req.product.attr.{mkt.eval,perform}).  Debugging is permitted to incur 
additional overhead.

<a id="req.fun.debug.boundaries" name="req.fun.debug.boundaries">.req.fun.debug.boundaries</a>: The pool class must support checking for accesses 
outside the boundaries of live objects.

<a id="req.fun.debug.log" name="req.fun.debug.log">.req.fun.debug.log</a>: The pool class must support logging of all allocations and 
deallocations.

<a id="req.fun.debug.enumerate" name="req.fun.debug.enumerate">.req.fun.debug.enumerate</a>: The pool class must support examining all allocated 
objects.

<a id="req.fun.debug.free" name="req.fun.debug.free">.req.fun.debug.free</a>: The pool class must support detecting incorrect, 
overlapping, and double frees.

<a id="req.fun.tolerant" name="req.fun.tolerant">.req.fun.tolerant</a>: The pool class must support tolerance of erroneous usage 
(source req.product.attr.use.level.1).


Essential Requirements

<a id="req.fun.profile" name="req.fun.profile">.req.fun.profile</a>: The pool class should support memory usage profiling (source: 
req.product.attr.{mkt.eval, perform}).

<a id="req.attr.flex" name="req.attr.flex">.req.attr.flex</a>: The pool class should be flexible so that it can be tuned to 
specific allocation and freeing patterns (source: 
req.product.attr.flex,req.epcore.attr.{dl,cache,trap}.typ).  The flexibility 
requirement may be satisfied by multiple instances each optimizing a specific 
pattern.

<a id="req.attr.adapt" name="req.attr.adapt">.req.attr.adapt</a>: The pool class should be adaptive so that it can accommodate 
changing allocation and freeing patterns (source: 
req.epcore.fun.{tmp,stat}.policy, req.product.attr.{mkt.eval,perform}).


Nice Requirements

<a id="req.fun.suballocate" name="req.fun.suballocate">.req.fun.suballocate</a>: The pool class may support freeing of any aligned, 
contiguous subset of an allocated block (source req.epcore.fun.dl.free.any, 
req.product.attr.{mkt.eval,perform}).




ARCHITECTURE:

<a id="arch.overview" name="arch.overview">.arch.overview</a>: The pool has several layers: client allocation is by Allocation 
Points (APs). <a id="arch.overview.ap" name="arch.overview.ap">.arch.overview.ap</a>: APs acquire storage from the pool 
available-block queue (ABQ). <a id="arch.overview.abq" name="arch.overview.abq">.arch.overview.abq</a>: The ABQ holds blocks of a 
minimum configurable size: "reuse size".  <a id="arch.overview.storage" name="arch.overview.storage">.arch.overview.storage</a>: The ABQ 
acquires storage from the arena or from the coalescing-block structure (CBS). 
<a id="arch.overview.storage.contiguous" name="arch.overview.storage.contiguous">.arch.overview.storage.contiguous</a>: The arena storage is requested to be 
contiguous to maximize opportunities for coalescing (Loci will be used when 
available). <a id="arch.overview.cbs" name="arch.overview.cbs">.arch.overview.cbs</a>: The CBS holds blocks freed by the client until, 
through coalescing, they have reached the reuse size, at which point they are 
made available on the ABQ.

<a id="arch.ap" name="arch.ap">.arch.ap</a>: The pool will use allocation points as the allocation interface to 
the client. <a id="arch.ap.two-phase" name="arch.ap.two-phase">.arch.ap.two-phase</a>: Allocation points will request blocks from the 
pool and suballocate those blocks (using the existing AP, compare and 
increment, 2-phase mechanism) to satisfy client requests. <a id="arch.ap.fill" name="arch.ap.fill">.arch.ap.fill</a>: The 
pool will have a configurable "fill size" that will be the preferred size block 
used to fill the allocation point. <a id="arch.ap.fill.size" name="arch.ap.fill.size">.arch.ap.fill.size</a>: The fill size should be 
chosen to amortize the cost of refill over a number of typical reserve/commit 
operations, but not so large as to exceed the typical object population of the 
pool. <a id="arch.ap.no-fit" name="arch.ap.no-fit">.arch.ap.no-fit</a>: When an allocation does not fit in the remaining space 
of the allocation point, there may be a remaining fragment. 
<a id="arch.ap.no-fit.sawdust" name="arch.ap.no-fit.sawdust">.arch.ap.no-fit.sawdust</a>: If the fragment is below a configurable threshold 
(minimum size), it will be left unused (but returned to the CBS so it will be 
reclaimed when adjacent objects are freed); <a id="arch.ap.no-fit.splinter" name="arch.ap.no-fit.splinter">.arch.ap.no-fit.splinter</a>: 
otherwise, the remaining fragment will be (effectively) returned to the head of 
the available-block queue, so that it will be used as soon as possible (i.e., 
by objects of similar birthdate). <a id="arch.ap.no-fit.oversize" name="arch.ap.no-fit.oversize">.arch.ap.no-fit.oversize</a>: If the requested 
allocation exceeds the fill size it is treated exceptionally (this may indicate 
the client has either misconfigured or misused the pool and should either 
change the pool configuration or create a separate pool for these exceptional 
objects for best performance). <a id="arch.ap.no-fit.oversize.policy" name="arch.ap.no-fit.oversize.policy">.arch.ap.no-fit.oversize.policy</a>: Oversize blocks 
are assumed to have exceptional lifetimes, hence are allocated to one side and 
do not participate in the normal storage recycling of the pool. 
<a id="arch.ap.refill.overhead" name="arch.ap.refill.overhead">.arch.ap.refill.overhead</a>: If reuse size is small, or becomes small due to 
.arch.adapt, all allocations will effectively be treated exceptionally (the AP 
will trip and a oldest-fit block will be chosen on each allocation).  This mode 
will be within a constant factor in overhead of an unbuffered pool.

<a id="arch.abq" name="arch.abq">.arch.abq</a>: The available block queue holds blocks that have coalesced 
sufficiently to reach reuse size.  arch<a id="abq.reuse.size" name="abq.reuse.size">.abq.reuse.size</a>: A multiple of the 
quantum of virtual memory is used as the reuse size (.anal.policy.size).  
<a id="arch.abq.fifo" name="arch.abq.fifo">.arch.abq.fifo</a>: It is a FIFO queue (recently coalesced blocks go to the tail of 
the queue, blocks are taken from the head of the queue for reuse). 
<a id="arch.abq.delay-reuse" name="arch.abq.delay-reuse">.arch.abq.delay-reuse</a>: By thus delaying reuse, coalescing opportunities are 
greater. <a id="arch.abq.high-water" name="arch.abq.high-water">.arch.abq.high-water</a>: It has a configurable high water mark, which 
when reached will cause blocks at the head of the queue to be returned to the 
arena, rather than reused. <a id="arch.abq.return" name="arch.abq.return">.arch.abq.return</a>: When the MPS supports it, the pool 
will be able to return free blocks from the ABQ to the arena on demand. 
<a id="arch.return.segment" name="arch.return.segment">.arch.return.segment</a>: arch.abq.return can be guaranteed to be able to return a 
segment by setting reuse size to twice the size of the segments the pool 
requests from the arena.

<a id="arch.cbs" name="arch.cbs">.arch.cbs</a>: The coalescing block structure holds blocks that have been freed by 
the client. <a id="arch.cbs.optimize" name="arch.cbs.optimize">.arch.cbs.optimize</a>: The data structure is optimized for coalescing. 
<a id="arch.cbs.abq" name="arch.cbs.abq">.arch.cbs.abq</a>: When a block reaches reuse size, it is added to the ABQ. 
<a id="arch.cbs.data-structure" name="arch.cbs.data-structure">.arch.cbs.data-structure</a>: The data structures are organized so that a block can 
be on both the CBS and ABQ simultaneously to permit additional coalescing, up 
until the time the block is removed from the ABQ and assigned to an AP.

<a id="arch.fragmentation.internal" name="arch.fragmentation.internal">.arch.fragmentation.internal</a>: Internal fragmentation results from The pool will 
request large segments from the arena to minimize the internal fragmentation 
due to objects not crossing segment boundaries.

<a id="arch.modular" name="arch.modular">.arch.modular</a>: The architecture will be modular, to allow building variations 
on the pool by assembling different parts. <a id="arch.modular.example" name="arch.modular.example">.arch.modular.example</a>: For example, 
it should be possible to build pools with any of the freelist mechanisms, with 
in-band or out-of-band storage (where applicable), that do or do not support 
derived object descriptions, etc.

<a id="arch.modular.initial" name="arch.modular.initial">.arch.modular.initial</a>: The initial architecture will use 
.mech.freelist.splay-tree for the CBS, .sol.mech.storage.out-of-band, 
.sol.mech.desc.derived, and .sol.mech.allocate.buffer.

<a id="arch.segregate" name="arch.segregate">.arch.segregate</a>: The architecture will support segregated allocation through 
the use of multiple allocation points. The client will choose the appropriate 
allocation point either at run time, or when possible, at compile time.

<a id="arch.segregate.initial" name="arch.segregate.initial">.arch.segregate.initial</a>: The initial architecture will segregate allocations 
into two classes: large and small. This will be implemented by creating two 
pools with different parameters.

<a id="arch.segregate.initial.choice" name="arch.segregate.initial.choice">.arch.segregate.initial.choice</a>: The initial architecture will provide glue code 
to choose which pool to allocate from at run time. If possible this glue code 
will be written in a way that a good compiler can optimize the selection of 
pool at compile time. Eventually this glue code should be subsumed by the 
client or generated automatically by a tool.

<a id="arch.debug" name="arch.debug">.arch.debug</a>: Debugging features such as tags, fenceposts, types, creators will 
be implemented in a layer above the pool and APs.  A generic pool debugging 
interface will be developed to support debugging in this outer layer.

<a id="arch.debug.initial" name="arch.debug.initial">.arch.debug.initial</a>: The initial architecture will have counters for 
objects/bytes allocated/freed and support for detecting overlapping frees.

<a id="arch.dependency.loci" name="arch.dependency.loci">.arch.dependency.loci</a>: The architecture depends on the arena being able to 
efficiently provide segments of varying sizes without excessive fragmentation.  
The locus mechanism should satisfy this dependency. (See .anal.strategy.risk) 

<a id="arch.dependency.mfs" name="arch.dependency.mfs">.arch.dependency.mfs</a>: The architecture internal data structures depend on 
efficient manual management of small, fixed-sized objects (2 different sizes). 
The MFS pool should satisfy this dependency.

<a id="arch.contingency" name="arch.contingency">.arch.contingency</a>: Since the strategy we propose is new, it may not work. 
<a id="arch.contingency.pathalogical" name="arch.contingency.pathalogical">.arch.contingency.pathalogical</a>: In particular, pathological allocation patterns 
could result in fragmentation such that no blocks recycle from the CBS to ABQ. 
<a id="arch.contingency.fallback" name="arch.contingency.fallback">.arch.contingency.fallback</a>: As a fallback, there will be a pool creation 
parameter for a high water mark for the CBS. 
<a id="arch.contingency.fragmentation-limit" name="arch.contingency.fragmentation-limit">.arch.contingency.fragmentation-limit</a>: When the free space in the CBS as a 
percentage of all the memory managed by the pool (a measure of fragmentation) 
reaches that high water mark, the CBS will be searched oldest-fit before 
requesting additional segments from the arena. <a id="arch.contingency.alternative" name="arch.contingency.alternative">.arch.contingency.alternative</a>: 
We also plan to implement .mech.freelist.cartesian-tree as an alternative CBS, 
which would permit more efficient searching of the CBS.

<a id="arch.parameters" name="arch.parameters">.arch.parameters</a>: The architecture supports several parameters so that multiple 
pools may be instantiated and tuned to support different object cohorts. The 
important parameters are: reuse size, minimum size, fill size, ABQ high water 
mark, CBS fragmentation limit (see .arch.contingency.fragmentation-limit).  
<a id="arch.parameters.client-visible" name="arch.parameters.client-visible">.arch.parameters.client-visible</a>: The client-visible parameters of the pool are 
the minimum object size, the mean object size, the maximum object size, the 
reserve depth and fragmentation limit.  The minimum object size determines when 
a splinter is kept on the head of the ABQ (.arch.ap.no-fit.splinter).  The 
maximum object size determines the fill size (.arch.ap.fill-size) and hence 
when a block is allocated exceptionally (.arch.ap.no-fit.oversize). The mean 
object size is the most likely object size.  The reserve depth is a measure of 
the hysteresis of the object population.  The mean object size, reserve depth 
and, maximum object size are used to determine the size of the ABQ 
(.arch.abq.high-water).  The fragmentation limit is used to determine when 
contingency mode is used to satisfy an allocation request (.arch.contingency).

<a id="arch.adapt" name="arch.adapt">.arch.adapt</a>: We believe that an important adaptation to explore is tying the 
reuse size inversely to the fragmentation (as measured in 
.arch.contingency.fragmentation-limit). <a id="arch.adapt.reuse" name="arch.adapt.reuse">.arch.adapt.reuse</a>: By setting reuse 
size low when fragmentation is high, smaller blocks will be available for 
reuse, so fragmentation should diminish. <a id="arch.adapt.overhead" name="arch.adapt.overhead">.arch.adapt.overhead</a>: This will result 
in higher overhead as the AP will need to be refilled more often, so reuse size 
should be raised again as fragmentation diminishes. <a id="arch.adapt.oldest-fit" name="arch.adapt.oldest-fit">.arch.adapt.oldest-fit</a>: In 
the limit, if reuse size goes to zero, the pool will implement a "oldest-fit" 
policy: the oldest free block of sufficient size will be used for each 
allocation.

<a id="arch.adapt.risk" name="arch.adapt.risk">.arch.adapt.risk</a>: This adaptation is an experimental policy and should not be 
delivered to clients until thoroughly tested.





ANALYSIS:

<a id="anal.discard" name="anal.discard">.anal.discard</a>: We have discarded many traditional solutions based on experience 
and analysis in paper.wil95(1). In particular, managing the free list as a 
linear list arranged by address or size and basing policy on searching such a 
linear list in a particular direction, from a particular starting point, using 
fit and/or immediacy as criteria. We believe that none of these solutions is 
derived from considering the root of the problem to be solved (as described in 
.strategy), although their behavior as analyzed by Wilson gives several 
insights.

<a id="anal.strategy" name="anal.strategy">.anal.strategy</a>: For any program to run in the minimum required memory (with 
minimal overhead -- we discard solutions such as compression for now), 
fragmentation must be eliminated. To eliminate fragmentation, simply place 
blocks in memory so that they die "in order" and can be immediately coalesced. 
This ideal is not achievable, but we believe we can find object attributes that 
correlate with deathtime and exploit them to approximate the ideal. Initially 
we believe birth time and type (as approximated by size) will be useful 
attributes to explore.

<a id="anal.strategy.perform" name="anal.strategy.perform">.anal.strategy.perform</a>: To meet .req.attr.performance, the implementation of 
.sol.strategy must be competitive in both time and space.

<a id="anal.strategy.risk" name="anal.strategy.risk">.anal.strategy.risk</a>: The current MPS segment substrate can cause internal 
fragmentation which an individual pool can do nothing about. We expect that 
request.epcore.170193.sugg.loci will be implemented to remove this risk.

<a id="anal.policy" name="anal.policy">.anal.policy</a>: Deferred coalescing, when taken to the extreme will not minimize 
the memory consumption of a program, as no memory would ever be reused. Eager 
reuse appears to lead to more fragmentation, whereas delayed reuse appears to 
reduce fragmentation (paper.wil95(1)). The systems studied by Wilson did not 
directly address deferring reuse. Our proposed policy is to reuse blocks when 
they reach a (configurable) size. We believe that this policy along with the 
policy of segregating allocations by death time, will greatly reduce 
fragmentation. <a id="anal.policy.risk" name="anal.policy.risk">.anal.policy.risk</a>: This policy could lead to pathologic behavior 
if allocations cannot be successfully segregated.

<a id="anal.policy.allocate.segregate" name="anal.policy.allocate.segregate">.anal.policy.allocate.segregate</a>: This policy has some similarities to 
CustomAlloc (paper.grun92(1)). CustomAlloc segregates objects by size classes, 
and then within those classes chooses a different allocator depending on 
whether that size class has a stable or unstable population. Classes with 
stable population recycle storage within the class, whereas classes with 
unstable populations return their storage to the general allocation pool for 
possible reuse by another class. CustomAlloc, however, requires profiling the 
application and tuning the allocator according to those profiles. Although we 
intend to support such tuning, we do not want to require it.

<a id="anal.policy.reallocate" name="anal.policy.reallocate">.anal.policy.reallocate</a>: For reallocation, .fun.suballocate can be used to free 
the remainder if a block is made smaller. Doing so will cause the freed block 
to obey .sol.policy.allocate [i.e., the freed block will not be treated 
specially, it will be subject to the normal policy on reuse]. Copying can be 
used if a block is made larger. paper.vo96(0) reports success in 
over-allocating a block the first time it is resized larger, presumably because 
blocks that are resized once tend to be resized again and over-allocating may 
avoid a subsequent copy. If each object that will be reallocated can be given 
its own allocation point until its final reallocation, the allocation point can 
be used to hold released or spare storage.

<a id="anal.policy.size" name="anal.policy.size">.anal.policy.size</a>: We believe that this will take advantage of the underlying 
virtual memory system's ability to compact the physical memory footprint of the 
program by discarding free fragments that align with the virtual memory 
quantum.  (In a VM system one can approximate compaction by sparse mapping.  If 
every other page of a segment is unused, the unused pages can be unmapped, 
freeing up physical memory that can be mapped to a new contiguous vm range.)

<a id="anal.mech.freelist" name="anal.mech.freelist">.anal.mech.freelist</a>: The literature (paper.grun92(1), paper.vo96(0)) indicate 
that .sol.freelist.cartesian-tree provides a space-efficient implementation at 
some cost in speed. .sol.freelist.splay-tree is faster but less 
space-efficient. .sol.freelist.bitmap is unstudied. Many of the faster 
allocators maintain caches of free blocks by size to speed allocation of 
"popular" sizes. We intend to initially explore not doing so, as we believe 
that policy ultimately leads to fragmentation by mixing objects of varying 
death times. Instead we intend to use a free list mechanism to support fast 
coalescing, deferring reuse of blocks until a minimum size has been reached.

anal<a id="mech.allocate.optimize-small" name="mech.allocate.optimize-small">.mech.allocate.optimize-small</a>: Wilson (paper.wil95(1)) notes that small 
blocks typically have short lifetimes and that overall performance is improved 
if you optimize the management of small blocks, e.g., 
sol.mech.allocate.lookup-table for all small blocks.  We believe that 
.sol.mech.allocate.buffer does exactly that.

<a id="anal.mech.allocate.optimize-new" name="anal.mech.allocate.optimize-new">.anal.mech.allocate.optimize-new</a>: Wilson (paper.wil95(1)) reports some benefit 
from "preserving wilderness", that is, when a block of memory must be requested 
from the system to satisfy an allocation, only the minimum amount of that block 
is used, the remainder is preserved (effectively by putting it at the tail of 
the free list). This mechanism may or may not implement .sol.policy.allocate. 
We believe a better mechanism is to choose to preserve or not, based on 
.sol.policy.allocate.




IDEAS:

<a id="sol" name="sol">.sol</a>: Many solution ideas for manual management of variable-sized memory blocks 
are enumerated by paper.wil95(1). Here we list the most promising, and some of 
our own.


Strategy

<a id="sol.strategy" name="sol.strategy">.sol.strategy</a>: To run a program in the minimal required memory, with minimal 
overhead, utilize memory efficiently. Memory becomes unusable when fragmented. 
Strategy is to minimize fragmentation. So place blocks where they won't cause 
fragmentation later.

<a id="sol.strategy.death" name="sol.strategy.death">.sol.strategy.death</a>: objects that will die together (in time) should be 
allocated together (in space); thus they will coalesce, reducing fragmentation.

<a id="sol.strategy.death.birth" name="sol.strategy.death.birth">.sol.strategy.death.birth</a>: assume objects allocated near each other in time 
will have similar deathtimes (paper.beck82(0))
<a id="sol.strategy.death.type" name="sol.strategy.death.type">.sol.strategy.death.type</a>: assume objects of different type may have different 
deathtimes, even if born together
<a id="sol.strategy.death.predict" name="sol.strategy.death.predict">.sol.strategy.death.predict</a>: find and use program features to predict deathtimes

<a id="sol.strategy.reallocate" name="sol.strategy.reallocate">.sol.strategy.reallocate</a>: reallocation implies rebirth, or at least a change in 
lifetime

<a id="sol.strategy.debug" name="sol.strategy.debug">.sol.strategy.debug</a>: as much of the debugging functionality as possible should 
be implemented as a generally available MPS utility; the pool will provide 
support for debugging that would be expensive or impossible to allocate outside 
the pool


Policy

[Policy is an implementable decision procedure, hopefully approximating the 
strategy.]

<a id="sol.policy.reuse" name="sol.policy.reuse">.sol.policy.reuse</a>: defer reusing blocks, to encourage coalescing
<a id="sol.policy.split" name="sol.policy.split">.sol.policy.split</a>: when a block is split to satisfy an allocation, use the 
remainder as soon as possible
<a id="sol.policy.size" name="sol.policy.size">.sol.policy.size</a>: prevent .policy.reuse from consuming all of memory by 
choosing a (coalesced) block for reuse when it reaches a minimum size
<a id="sol.policy.size.fixed" name="sol.policy.size.fixed">.sol.policy.size.fixed</a>: use the quantum of virtual memory (e.g., one page) as 
minimum size
<a id="sol.policy.size.tune" name="sol.policy.size.tune">.sol.policy.size.tune</a>: allow tuning minimum size
<a id="sol.policy.size.adapt" name="sol.policy.size.adapt">.sol.policy.size.adapt</a>: adaptively change minimum size
<a id="sol.policy.allocate" name="sol.policy.allocate">.sol.policy.allocate</a>: allocate objects with similar birthdate and lifetime 
together
<a id="sol.policy.allocate.segregate" name="sol.policy.allocate.segregate">.sol.policy.allocate.segregate</a>: segregate allocations by type
<a id="sol.policy.allocate.segregate.size" name="sol.policy.allocate.segregate.size">.sol.policy.allocate.segregate.size</a>: use size as a substitute for type
<a id="sol.policy.allocate.segregate.tune" name="sol.policy.allocate.segregate.tune">.sol.policy.allocate.segregate.tune</a>: permit tuning of segregation
<a id="sol.policy.allocate.segregate.adapt" name="sol.policy.allocate.segregate.adapt">.sol.policy.allocate.segregate.adapt</a>: adaptively segregate allocations

<a id="sol.policy.reallocate" name="sol.policy.reallocate">.sol.policy.reallocate</a>: implement reallocation in a central mechanism outside 
of the pool, create a generic pool interface in support of same.

<a id="sol.policy.debug" name="sol.policy.debug">.sol.policy.debug</a>: implement a pool debugging interface
<a id="sol.policy.debug.counters" name="sol.policy.debug.counters">.sol.policy.debug.counters</a>: implement debugging counters in the pool that are 
queried with a generic interface
<a id="sol.policy.debug.verify" name="sol.policy.debug.verify">.sol.policy.debug.verify</a>: implement debugging error returns on overlapping frees


Mechanism

[Mechanisms are algorithms or data structures used to implement policy.]

<a id="sol.mech.free-list" name="sol.mech.free-list">.sol.mech.free-list</a>: mechanisms that can be used to describe the free list

<a id="sol.mech.free-list.cartesian-tree" name="sol.mech.free-list.cartesian-tree">.sol.mech.free-list.cartesian-tree</a>: Using address and size as keys supports 
fast coalescing of adjacent blocks and fast searching for optimal-sized blocks. 
Unfortunately, because the shape of the tree is constrained by the second key, 
it can become unbalanced. This data structure is used in the SunOS 4.1 malloc 
(paper.grun92(1)).
<a id="sol.mech.free-list.splay-tree" name="sol.mech.free-list.splay-tree">.sol.mech.free-list.splay-tree</a>: The amortized cost of a splay tree is 
competitive with balanced binary trees in the worst case, but can be 
significantly better for regular patterns of access because recently-accessed 
keys are moved to the root of the tree and hence can be re-accessed quickly. 
This data structure is used in the System Vr4 malloc (paper.vo96(0)). (For a 
complete analysis of the splay tree algorithm time bounds see paper.st85(0).)
<a id="sol.mech.free-list.bit-map" name="sol.mech.free-list.bit-map">.sol.mech.free-list.bit-map</a>: Using address as an index and fix-sized blocks, 
the booleans can represent whether a block is free or not. Adjacent blocks can 
be used to construct larger blocks. Efficient algorithms for searching for runs 
in a vector are known. This data structure is used in many file system disk 
block managers.
<a id="sol.mech.free-list.refcount" name="sol.mech.free-list.refcount">.sol.mech.free-list.refcount</a>: A count of the number of allocated but not freed 
subblocks of a block can be used to determine when a block is available for 
reuse. This is an extremely compact data structure, but does not support 
subblock reuse.
<a id="sol.mech.free-list.hybrid" name="sol.mech.free-list.hybrid">.sol.mech.free-list.hybrid</a>: Bitmaps appear suited particularly to managing 
small, contiguous blocks. The tree structures appear suited particularly to 
managing varying-sized, discontiguous blocks. A refcount can be very efficient 
if objects can be placed accurately according to death time. A hybrid mechanism 
may offer better performance for a wider range of situations.

<a id="sol.mech.storage" name="sol.mech.storage">.sol.mech.storage</a>: methods that can be used to store the free list description

<a id="sol.mech.storage.in-band" name="sol.mech.storage.in-band">.sol.mech.storage.in-band</a>: The tree data structures are amenable to being 
stored in the free blocks themselves, minimizing the space overhead of 
management. To do so imposes a minimum size on free blocks and reduces the 
locality of the data structure.
<a id="sol.mech.storage.out-of-band" name="sol.mech.storage.out-of-band">.sol.mech.storage.out-of-band</a>: The bit-map data structure must be stored 
separately.

<a id="sol.mech.desc" name="sol.mech.desc">.sol.mech.desc</a>: for an allocated block to be freed, its base and bound must be 
known

<a id="sol.mech.desc.derived" name="sol.mech.desc.derived">.sol.mech.desc.derived</a>: Most clients can supply the base of the block. Some 
clients can supply the bound.
<a id="sol.mech.desc.in-band" name="sol.mech.desc.in-band">.sol.mech.desc.in-band</a>: When the bound cannot be supplied, it can be stored as 
an in-band "header". If neither the base nor bound can be supplied (e.g., the 
client may only have an interior pointer to the block), a header and footer may 
be required.
<a id="sol.mech.desc.out-of-band" name="sol.mech.desc.out-of-band">.sol.mech.desc.out-of-band</a>: In un-tagged architectures, it may be necessary to 
store the header and footer out-of-band to distinguish them from client data. 
Out-of-band storage can improve locality and reliability. Any of the free-list 
structures can also be used to describe allocated blocks out-of-band.
<a id="sol.mech.desc.crossing-map" name="sol.mech.desc.crossing-map">.sol.mech.desc.crossing-map</a>: An alternative for untagged architectures is to 
store a "crossing map" which records an encoding of the start of objects and 
then store the descriptive information in-band.

<a id="sol.mech.allocate" name="sol.mech.allocate">.sol.mech.allocate</a>: mechanisms that can be used to allocate blocks (these 
typically sit on top of a more general free-list manager)

<a id="sol.mech.allocate.lookup-table" name="sol.mech.allocate.lookup-table">.sol.mech.allocate.lookup-table</a>: Use a table of popular sizes to cache free 
blocks of those sizes.
<a id="sol.mech.allocate.buffer" name="sol.mech.allocate.buffer">.sol.mech.allocate.buffer</a>: Allocate from contiguous blocks using compare and 
increment.
<a id="sol.mech.allocate.optimize-small" name="sol.mech.allocate.optimize-small">.sol.mech.allocate.optimize-small</a>: Use a combination of techniques to ensure 
the time spent managing a block is small relative to the block's lifetime; 
assume small blocks typically have short lifetimes.
<a id="sol.mech.allocate.optimize-new" name="sol.mech.allocate.optimize-new">.sol.mech.allocate.optimize-new</a>: When "virgin" memory is acquired from the 
operating system to satisfy a request, try to preserve it (i.e., use only what 
is necessary)
<a id="sol.mech.allocate.segregate.size" name="sol.mech.allocate.segregate.size">.sol.mech.allocate.segregate.size</a>: use size as a substitute for type

<a id="sol.mech.reallocate" name="sol.mech.reallocate">.sol.mech.reallocate</a>: use .req.fun.suballocate to return unused memory when a 
block shrinks, but differentiate this from an erroneous overlapping free by 
using separate interfaces.




IMPLEMENTATION:

The implementation consists of the following separable modules:


Coalescing Block Structure

<a id="impl.c.cbs" name="impl.c.cbs">.impl.c.cbs</a>: The initial implementation will use .sol.mech.free-list.splay-tree 
and sol.mech.storage.out-of-band. For locality, this storage should be managed 
as a linked free list of splay nodes suballocated from blocks acquired from a 
pool shared by all CBS's. Must support creation and destruction of an empty 
tree. Must support search, insert and delete by key of type Addr.  Must support 
finding left and right neighbors of a failed search for a key. Must support 
iterating over the elements of the tree with reasonable efficiency. Must 
support storing and retrieving a value of type Size associated with the key. 
Standard checking and description should be provided. See design.mps.splay(0) 
and design.mps.cbs(0).


Available Block Queue

<a id="impl.c.abq" name="impl.c.abq">.impl.c.abq</a>: The initial implementation will be a queue of fixed size 
(determined at pool creation time from the high water mark). Must support 
creation and destruction of an empty queue. Must support insertion at the head 
or tail of the queue (failing if full), peeking at the head of the queue, and 
removal of the head (failing if empty) or any element of the queue (found by a 
search). Standard checking and description should be provided.


Pool Implementation

<a id="impl.c" name="impl.c">.impl.c</a>: The initial implementation will use the above modules to implement a 
buffered pool. Must support creation and destruction of the pool. Creation 
takes parameters: minimum size, mean size, maximum size, reserve depth and 
fragmentation limit. Minimum, mean, and maximum size are used to calculate the 
internal fill and reuse sizes. Reserve depth and mean size are used to 
calculate the ABQ high water mark.  Fragmentation limit is used to set the CBS 
contingency mode.  Must support buffer initialization, filling and emptying. 
Must support freeing. Standard checking and description should be provided. 
[Eventually, it should support scanning, so it can be used with collected 
pools, but no manual pool currently does.]

<a id="impl.c.future" name="impl.c.future">.impl.c.future</a>: The implementation should not preclude "buffered free" 
(mail.ptw.1997-12-05.19-07(0), ff.) being added in the future.

<a id="impl.c.parameters" name="impl.c.parameters">.impl.c.parameters</a>: The pool parameters are calculated as follows from the 
input parameters: minimum, mean, and maximum size are taked directly from the 
parameters.  <a id="impl.c.parameter.fill-size" name="impl.c.parameter.fill-size">.impl.c.parameter.fill-size</a>: The fill size is set to the maximum 
size times the reciprocal of the fragmentation limit, aligned to the arena 
alignment.  <a id="imple.c.parameter.reuse-size" name="imple.c.parameter.reuse-size">.imple.c.parameter.reuse-size</a>: The reuse size is set to twice the 
fill size (see .arch.abq.return.segment, .impl.c.free.merge.segment).  
<a id="impl.c.parameter.abq-limit" name="impl.c.parameter.abq-limit">.impl.c.parameter.abq-limit</a>: The ABQ high-water limit is set to the reserve 
depth times the mean size (that is, the queue should hold as many reuse blocks 
as would take to cover the population hysteresis if the population consisted 
solely of mean-sized blocks, see .arch.abq.high-water).  
<a id="impl.c.parameter.avail-limit" name="impl.c.parameter.avail-limit">.impl.c.parameter.avail-limit</a>: The CBS high-water limit is implemented by 
comparing the available free space to an "available limit".  The available 
limit is updated each time a segment is allocated from or returned to the arena 
by setting it to the total size of the pool times the fragmentation limit 
divide vy 100 (see .arch.contingency.fallback).

<a id="impl.c.ap.fill" name="impl.c.ap.fill">.impl.c.ap.fill</a>: An AP fill request will be handled as follows:
o If the request is larger than fill size, attempt to request a segment from 
the arena sufficient to satisfy the request
o Use any previously returned splinter (from .impl.c.ap.empty), if large enough
o Attempt to retrieve a free block from the head of the ABQ (removing it from 
ABQ and CBS if found).
o If above fragmentation limit, attempt to find a block on the CBS, using 
oldest-fit search
o Attempt to request a segment of fill size from the arena
o Attempt to find a block on the CBS, using oldest-fit search
o Otherwise, fail

<a id="impl.c.ap.empty" name="impl.c.ap.empty">.impl.c.ap.empty</a>: An AP empty request will be handled as follows:
o If remaining free is less than min size, return it to the CBS
o If the remaining free is larger than any previous splinter, return that 
splinter to the CBS and save this one for use by a subsequent fill
o Otherwise return the remaining block to the CBS

<a id="impl.c.free" name="impl.c.free">.impl.c.free</a>: When blocks are returned to the CBS a search is made for adjacent 
blocks that can be merged. If not, the block is simply inserted in the CBS. If 
a merge occurs between two blocks on the ABQ, the ABQ must be adjusted to 
reflect the merge. <a id="impl.c.free.exception" name="impl.c.free.exception">.impl.c.free.exception</a>: Exceptional blocks are returned 
directly to the arena.

<a id="impl.c.free.merge" name="impl.c.free.merge">.impl.c.free.merge</a>: If a merge occurs and the merged block is larger than reuse 
size:
o If the ABQ is full, remove the block at the head of the ABQ from the ABQ and 
CBS and return it to the arena(*)
o Insert the newly merged block at the tail of the ABQ, leaving it on the CBS 
for further merging

<a id="impl.c.free.merge.segment" name="impl.c.free.merge.segment">.impl.c.free.merge.segment</a>: (*) Merged blocks may not align with arena 
segments. If necessary, return the interior segments of a block to the arena 
and return the splinters to the CBS.  <a id="impl.c.free.merge.segment.reuse" name="impl.c.free.merge.segment.reuse">.impl.c.free.merge.segment.reuse</a>: If the 
reuse size (the size at which blocks recycle from the CBS to the ABQ) is at 
least twice the fill size (the size of segments the pool allocates from the 
arena), we can guarantee that there will always be a returnable segment in 
every ABQ block. <a id="impl.c.free.merge.segment.overflow" name="impl.c.free.merge.segment.overflow">.impl.c.free.merge.segment.overflow</a>: If the reuse size is set 
smaller (see .arch.adapt), there may not be a returnable segment in an ABQ 
block, in which case the ABQ has "overflowed".  Whenever this occurs, the ABQ 
will be refilled by searching the CBS for dropped reusable blocks when needed.

<a id="impl.c.free.merge.segment.risk" name="impl.c.free.merge.segment.risk">.impl.c.free.merge.segment.risk</a>: The current segment structure does not really 
support what we would like to do.  Loci should do better:  support reserving 
contiguous address space and mapping/unmapping any portion of that address 
space.

<a id="impl.c.free.merge.alternative" name="impl.c.free.merge.alternative">.impl.c.free.merge.alternative</a>: Alternatively, if the MPS segment substrate 
permitted mapping/unmapping of pages, the pool could use very large segments 
and map/unmap pages as needed.


AP Dispatch

<a id="impl.c.multiap" name="impl.c.multiap">.impl.c.multiap</a>: The initial implementation will be a glue layer that selects 
among several AP's for allocation according to the predicted deathtime (as 
approximated by size) of the requested allocation. Each AP will be filled from 
a pool instance tuned to the range of object sizes expected to be allocated 
from that AP. [For bonus points provide an interface that creates a batch of 
pools and AP's according to some set of expected object sizes. Eventually 
expand to understand object lifetimes and general lifetime prediction keys.]

impl<a id="c.multiap.sample-code" name="c.multiap.sample-code">.c.multiap.sample-code</a>: This glue code is not properly part of the pool or 
MPS interface.  It is a layer on top of the MPS interface, intended as sample 
code for unsophisticated clients.  Sophisticated clients will likely want to 
choose among multiple AP's more directly.




TESTING:

<a id="test.component" name="test.component">.test.component</a>: Components .impl.c.splay, .impl.c.cbs, and .impl.c.abq will be 
subjected to individual component tests to verify their functionality.

<a id="test.regression" name="test.regression">.test.regression</a>: All tests applied to poolmv (design.mps.poolmv(0)) and 
poolepdl (design.mps.poolepdl(0)) will be applied to poolmv2 to ensure that mv2 
is at least as functional as the pools it is replacing.

<a id="test.qa" name="test.qa">.test.qa</a>: Once poolmv2 is integrated into the MPS, the standard MPS QA tests 
will be applied to poolmv2 prior to each release.

<a id="test.customer" name="test.customer">.test.customer</a>: Customer acceptance tests will be performed on a per-customer 
basis before release to that customer (cf., proc.release.epcore(2).test) 


TEXT:

Possible tweaks (from mail.pekka.1998-04-15.13-10(0)):

1. Try to coalesce splinters returned from AP's with the front (or any) block 
on the ABQ.
2. Sort ABQ in some other way to minimize splitting/splinters. E.g., proximity 
to recently allocated blocks.
