INTRODUCTION

<a id="readership" name="readership">.readership</a>: Any MPS developer.

<a id="intro" name="intro">.intro</a>: This is the design of the VM Module for DEC UNIX (aka OSF/1 os.o1).  In 
general aspects (including interface) the design is as for design.mps.vm.

DETAILS

Functions

<a id="fun.unmap" name="fun.unmap">.fun.unmap</a>:

VMUnmap

It "unmaps" a region by replacing the existing mapping with a mapping using the 
vm-&gt;none_fd file descriptor (see mumble mumble, VMCreate), and protection set 
to PROT_NONE (ie no access).  <a id="fun.unmap.justify" name="fun.unmap.justify">.fun.unmap.justify</a>: Replacing the mapping in this 
way means that the address space is still reserved and will not be used by 
calls to mmap (perhaps in other libraries) which specify MAP_VARIABLE.  
<a id="fun.unmap.offset" name="fun.unmap.offset">.fun.unmap.offset</a>: The offset for this mapping is the offset of the region 
being unmapped in the VM; this gives the same effect as if there was one 
mapping of the vm-&gt;none_fd from the base to the limit of the VM (but "behind" 
all the other mappings that have been created).  <a id="fun.unmap.offset.justify" name="fun.unmap.offset.justify">.fun.unmap.offset.justify</a>: If 
this is not done (if for example the offset is always specified as 0) then the 
VM will cause the kernel to create a new file reference for each mapping 
created with VMUnmap; eventually the kernel refuses the mmap call because it 
can't create a new file reference.
