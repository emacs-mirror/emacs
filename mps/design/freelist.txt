Introduction
------------

_`.intro`: This document describes the free list allocator for the
Memory Pool System.

_`.readership`: Any MPS developer.


Overview
--------

_`.overview`: The free list allocator is an "emergency" allocator. It
is intended for use as a fallback allocation strategy in low memory
situations, when memory is not available for the control structures
needed by other allocators. In these situations the free list allocator
ensures that memory is not lost, but with several disadvantages:

1. operations on the free list are O(n) in the number of free blocks;
2. the data structures are stored in client memory and so are
   vulnerable to corruption;
3. the data structures have poor locality (and thus potentially poor
   cache performance).

When memory becomes available again to allocate control structures,
the free lists can be "flushed" back into the more efficient data
structures.

_`.bg`: The free list allocator was formerly part of the Coalescing
Block Structure module (see design.mps.cbs) but it was split into its
own module because this makes it:

1. simpler (no need to interact with CBS) and thus more maintainable;
2. possible to test directly (no need to create a CBS and then force
   its control pool to run out of memory); and
3. usable as a fallback allocator in other pools (not just in pools
   that use CBS).


Definitions
-----------

_`.def.range`: A (contiguous) *range* of addresses is a semi-open
interval on address space.

_`.def.isolated`: A contiguous range is *isolated* with respect to
some property it has, if adjacent elements do not have that property.


Requirements
------------

_`.req.set`: Must maintain a set of free address ranges.

_`.req.add`: Must be able to add free address ranges to the set.

_`.req.remove`: Must be able to remove address ranges from the set (in
particular, when memory is allocated).

_`.req.iterate`: Must support the iteration of all isolated contiguous
ranges.

_`.req.protocol`: Must detect protocol violations.

_`.req.align`: Must support an alignment (the alignment of all
addresses specifying ranges) of down to ``sizeof(void *)`` without
losing memory.

_`.req.zero-overhead`: Must have zero space overhead for the storage
of any set of free blocks, so that it can be used to manage memory
when no memory can be allocated for control structures.

_`.req.source`: This set of requirements is derived from those of the
CBS module (see design.mps.cbs.req), except that there is no
equivalent of design.mps.cbs.req.fast, and design.mps.cbs.req.small
has been replaced with `.req.zero-overhead`_.


Interface
---------


Types
.....

``typedef struct FreelistStruct *Freelist``

_`.type.freelist`: The type of free lists. The structure
``FreelistStruct`` is declared in the header so that it can be inlined
in other structures, but you should not depend on its details.

``typedef Bool (*FreelistIterateMethod)(Bool *deleteReturn, Freelist fl, Range range, void *closureP, Size closureS)``

_`.type.iterate.method`: A callback function that may be passed to
``FreelistIterate()``. It is called for every isolated contiguous
range in address order, and with the closure arguments that were
originally passed to ``FreelistIterate()``. It must update
``*deleteReturn`` to ``TRUE`` if the range must be deleted from the
free lists, or ``FALSE`` if the range must be kept. The function must
return ``TRUE`` if the iteration must continue, and ``FALSE`` if the
iteration must stop (after possibly deleting the current range).


Functions
.........

``Res FreelistInit(Freelist fl, Align alignment)``

_`.function.init`: Initialize the ``Freelist`` structure pointed to by
``fl``. The argument ``alignment`` is the alignment of address ranges
to be maintained. An initialised free list contains no address ranges.

``void FreelistFinish(Freelist fl)``

_`.function.finish`: Finish the free list pointed to by ``fl``.

``Res FreelistInsert(Range rangeReturn, Freelist fl, Range range)``

_`.function.insert`: If any part of ``range`` is already in the free
list ``fl``, then leave the free list unchanged and return
``ResFAIL``. Otherwise, insert ``range`` into the free list ``fl``;
update ``rangeReturn`` to describe the contiguous isolated range
containing the inserted range (this may differ from ``range`` if there
was coalescence on either side) and return ``ResOK``.

``Res FreelistDelete(Range rangeReturn, Freelist fl, Range range)``

_`.function.delete`: If any part of the range is not in the free list,
then leave the free list unchanged and return ``ResFAIL``. Otherwise,
remove ``range`` from the free list and update ``rangeReturn`` to
describe the contiguous isolated range that formerly contained the
deleted range (this may differ from ``range`` if there were fragments
left on either side), and return ``ResOK``.

``void FreelistIterate(Freelist fl, FreelistIterateMethod iterate, void *closureP, Size closureS)``

_`.function.iterate`: Iterate all isolated contiguous ranges in the
free list ``fl`` in address order, calling ``iterate`` for each one.
See ``FreelistIterateMethod`` for details.

``Bool FreelistFindFirst(Range rangeReturn, Range oldRangeReturn, Freelist fl, Size size, FindDelete findDelete)``

_`.function.find.first`: Locate the first isolated contiguous range in
address order, within the free list ``fl``, of at least ``size``
bytes, update ``rangeReturn`` to that range, and return ``TRUE``. If
there is no such continuous range, return ``FALSE``.

In addition, optionally delete the found range from the free list,
depending on the ``findDelete`` argument. This saves a separate call
to ``FreelistDelete()``, and uses the knowledge of exactly where we
found the range. The value of ``findDelete`` must come from this
enumeration::

    enum {
        FindDeleteNONE,    /* don't delete after finding */
        FindDeleteLOW,     /* delete size bytes from low end of block */
        FindDeleteHIGH,    /* delete size bytes from high end of block */
        FindDeleteENTIRE   /* delete entire range */
    };

The original contiguous isolated range in which the range was found is
returned via the ``oldRangeReturn`` argument. (If ``findDelete`` is
``FindDeleteNONE`` or ``FindDeleteENTIRE``, then this will be
identical to the range returned via the ``rangeReturn`` argument.)

``Bool FreelistFindLast(Range rangeReturn, Range oldRangeReturn, Freelist fl, Size size, FindDelete findDelete)``

_`.function.find.last`: Like ``FreelistFindFirst()``, except that it
finds the last block in address order.

``Bool FreelistFindLargest(Range rangeReturn, Range oldRangeReturn, Freelist fl, Size, size, FindDelete findDelete)``

_`.function.find.largest`: Locate the largest block within the free
list ``fl``, and if that block is at least as big as ``size``, return
its range via the ``rangeReturn`` argument, and return ``TRUE``. If
there are no blocks in the free list at least as large as ``size``,
return ``FALSE``. Pass 0 for ``size`` if you want the largest block
unconditionally.

Like ``FreelistFindFirst()``, optionally delete the range from the
free list. (Always the whole range: specifying ``FindDeleteLOW`` or
``FindDeleteHIGH`` has the same effect as ``FindDeleteENTIRE``).

``void FreelistFlushToCBS(Freelist fl, CBS cbs)``

Remove free address ranges from the free list ``fl`` and add them to
the Coalescing Block Structure ``cbs``. Continue until a call to
``CBSInsert()`` fails, or until the free list is empty, whichever
happens first.

``Res FreelistDescribe(Freelist fl, mps_lib_FILE *stream)``

_`.function.describe`: Print a textual representation of the free
list ``fl`` to the given stream, indicating the contiguous ranges in
order. It is provided for debugging purposes only.



Implementation
--------------

_`.impl.list`: The isolated contiguous free address ranges are kept on
an address-ordered singly linked free list. (As in traditional
``malloc()`` implementations.)

_`.impl.block`: If the free address range is large enough to contain
an inline block descriptor consisting of two pointers, then the two
pointers stored are to the next free range in address order (or
``NULL`` if there are no more ranges), and to the limit of current
free address range, in that order.

_`.impl.grain`: Otherwise, the free address range must be large enough
to contain a single pointer. The pointer stored is to the next free
range in address order, or ``NULL`` if there are no more ranges.

_`.impl.tag`: Grains and blocks are distinguished by a one-bit tag in
the low bit of the first word (the one containing the pointer to the
next range). Grains have this bit set; blocks have this bit reset.

_`.impl.invariant`: The ranges stored in the free list are *isolated*:
no two ranges are adjacent or overlapping.

_`.impl.merge`: When a free address range is added to the free list,
it is merged with adjacent ranges so as to maintain
`.impl.invariant`_.

_`.impl.rule.break`: The use of ``NULL`` to mark the end of the list
violates the rule that exceptional values should not be used to
distinguish exeptional situations. This infraction allows the
implementation to meet `.req.zero-overhead`_. (There are other ways to
do this, such as using another tag to indicate the last block in the
list, but these would be more complicated.)


Opportunities for improvement
-----------------------------

_`.improve.length`: When iterating over the list, we could check that
the number of elements visited in the course of the iteration does not
exceed the recorded size of the list.

_`.improve.maxsize`: We could maintain the maximum size of any range
on the list, and use that to make an early exit from
``FreelistFindLargest()``. It's not clear that this would actually be
an improvement.
