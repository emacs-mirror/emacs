Introduction
------------

This is the catalogue of design documents of the Memory Pool System
product.

.. warning::

   This is not a complete set of design documents for the MPS.  We have
   many hundreds of documents from before the MPS was acquired by
   Ravenbrook on 2001-08-10, many of which contain confidential
   information [RB_2002-06-18]_.  We are sorting through these and will
   include more as time goes on.  We have tried to select the key
   documents for inclusion in the open source release, by including
   those documents referenced by the source code.

   If there is a document you think might exist and want to see it,
   please write to mps-questions@ravenbrook.com and we will try to dig
   it up.
