Introduction
------------

_`.intro`: This document is the design of the MPS Library Interface, a
part of the plinth.

_`.readership`: Any MPS developer. Any clients that are prepared to
read this in order to get documentation.


Goals
-----

_`.goal`: The goals of the MPS library interface are:

_`.goal.host`: To control the dependency of the MPS on the hosted ISO
C library so that the core MPS remains freestanding (see
design.mps.exec-env_).

.. _design.mps.exec-env: exec-env

_`.goal.free`: To allow the core MPS convenient access to ISO C
functionality that is provided on freestanding platforms (see
design.mps.exec-env_).


Description
-----------

Overview
........

_`.overview.access`: The core MPS needs to access functionality that
could be provided by an ISO C hosted environment.

_`.overview.hosted`: The core MPS must not make direct use of any
facilities in the hosted environment (design.mps.exec-env_). However,
it is sensible to make use of them when the MPS is deployed in a
hosted environment.

_`.overview.hosted.indirect`: The core MPS does not make any direct
use of hosted ISO C library facilities. Instead, it indirects through
the MPS Library Interface, impl.h.mpslib.

_`.overview.provision.client`: In a freestanding environment the
client is expected to provide functions meeting this interface to the
MPS.

_`.overview.provision.hosted`: In a hosted environment,
impl.c.mpsliban may be used. It just maps impl.h.mpslib directly onto
the ISO C library equivalents.


Implementation
--------------

_`.impl`: The MPS Library Interface comprises a header file
impl.h.mpslib and some documentation.

_`.impl.decl`: The header file defines the interface to definitions
which parallel those parts of the non-freestanding ISO headers which
are used by the MPS.

_`.impl.include`: The header file also includes the freestanding
header ``<stddef.h>``.
