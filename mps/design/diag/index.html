<p> Readership: any MPS developer.  Not confidential. </p>


<h2> Introduction </h2>

<p>
Diagnostic output is information emitted by the MPS for the purpose 
of helping MPS programmers and client-code programmers.
</p>

<p>
It is not intended to be end-user readable (or visible).  It is not 
intended to be machine-parseable.  It is not intended to be stable 
from one release to the next.  It may be modified or removed at any 
time.
</p>

<p>
The steps in producing diagnostic output are:
</p>
<ol>
  <li> calculate, store, and propagate data; </li>
  <li> collate, <strong>synthesise</strong>, and format into a 
       human-useful diagnostic message; </li>
  <li> <strong>control</strong> output of messages; </li>
  <li> use a <strong>channel</strong> to get the message out. </li>
</ol>

<p>
Note:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> Keep the logic used to construct the human-useful message 
       <em>inside</em> the MPS.  
       This means that external utilities that display 
       the messages do not need to understand, or keep in sync 
       with, the details of what's going inside the MPS. </li>
</ul>


<h2> How to get diagnostic output </h2>

<p>
To run the MPS and get diagnostic output from it:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> Use a variety with diagnostic output facilities 
       compiled-in. Currently, that means 
       <strong>variety.di</strong>.  See config.h. </li>
  <li> Check that the diagnostic output you require is generated, 
       by looking in MPS source for invocations of the appropriate 
       macro (eg. DIAG_WRITEF()).  Currently, there is no way to 
       control output of diagnostic messages: all diagnostics 
       produced will be sent to the channel. </li>
  <li> Run the MPS and client in an environment that supports the 
       channel used (eg. at a command-line if using WriteF). </li>
</ul>

<h2> Channels </h2>

<p>
Example channels are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> printf; </li>
  <li> WriteF; </li>
  <li> a new type (yet to be defined) of mps_message; </li>
  <li> squirt them into the telemetry-log-events system; </li>
  <li> telnet. </li>
</ul> 

<p>
Currently, only printf and WriteF are supported.  
See the DIAG_WITH_ macros in mpm.h.
</p>

<p>
Note: it is unfortunate that choice of channel may (for some 
channels) also dictate the form of the code that synthesises the 
message.  (For example, WriteF-style parameter-expansion is not 
possible when using the printf channel, because there is no way 
to get WriteF to produce its output into a string).  This is just 
a technical hitch; logically, the code that synthesises a 
diagnostic message should not care which channel will be used to 
transmit it out of the MPS.

</p>
<p>
It must be possible to add, modify, or remove diagnostic output 
in diagnostic varieties, without a substantial secondary effect 
on non-diagnostic varieties.  It is not a requirement that there 
be zero effect.
</p>

<p>
This means:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> for actual output, you must use DIAG macros; </li>
  <li> for propagating and synthesising data, use appropriate 
       DIAG macros where it is reasonably clean, such as for local 
       variables and statements used only for diagnostic output; </li>
  <li> where it is clearer and without substantial secondary effect 
       to include code (such as additional function parameters) in 
       all varieties, that's okay. </li>
</ul>
