<h2> Introduction </h2>

<p>
Diagnostic feedback is information created by the MPS diagnostic 
system for the purpose of helping MPS programmers and client-code 
programmers.
Such a piece of information is called "a diagnostic".
(See <a href="#related-systems">related systems</a>, below).
</p>

<p>
A diagnostic is not intended to be end-user readable (or visible), 
or machine-parseable.
A diagnostic is not intended to be stable from one release to the 
next: it may be modified or removed at any time.
</p>

<p>
The steps in producing diagnostic feedback are:
</p>
<ol>
  <li> calculate, store, and propagate data; </li>
  <li> collate, <strong>synthesise</strong>, and format into a 
       human-useful diagnostic; </li>
  <li> <strong>control</strong> output of diagnostics; </li>
  <li> use a <strong>channel</strong> to get the diagnostic out. </li>
</ol>

<p>
Note:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> Keep the logic used to construct the human-useful message 
       <em>inside</em> the MPS.  
       This means that external utilities that display 
       the messages do not need to understand, or keep in sync 
       with, the details of what's going inside the MPS. </li>
</ul>


<h2> How to get diagnostic output </h2>

<p>
To run the MPS and get diagnostic output from it:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> Use a variety with diagnostics 
       compiled-in. Currently, that means 
       <strong>variety.di</strong>.  See config.h. </li>
  <li> Check that the diagnostics you require are generated, 
       by looking in MPS source for invocations of the appropriate 
       macro (eg. DIAG_WRITEF()).  Currently, there is no way to 
       control output of diagnostics: all diagnostics 
       produced will be sent to the channel. </li>
  <li> Run the MPS and client in an environment that supports the 
       channel used (eg. at a command-line if using WriteF). </li>
</ul>


<h2> Channels </h2>

<p>
Example channels are:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> printf; </li>
  <li> WriteF; </li>
  <li> a new type (yet to be defined) of mps_message; </li>
  <li> squirt them into the telemetry-log-events system; </li>
  <li> telnet. </li>
</ul> 

<p>
Currently, only printf and WriteF are supported.  
See the DIAG_WITH_ macros in mpm.h.
</p>

<p>
You can also use a debugger to call &lt;type&gt;Describe() methods 
directly, from within the debugger.
</p>

<p>
Note: it is unfortunate that choice of channel may (for some 
channels) also dictate the form of the code that synthesises the 
message.  (For example, WriteF-style parameter-expansion is not 
possible when using the printf channel, because there is no way 
to get WriteF to produce its output into a string).  This is just 
a technical hitch; logically, the code that synthesises a 
diagnostic message should not care which channel will be used to 
transmit it out of the MPS.
</p>


<h2> Parts of the MPS diagnostic system </h2>

<p>
The following facilities are considered part of the MPS diagnostic 
system:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> the DIAG_* macros (DIAG_DECL, DIAG_BLOCK, DIAG_WRITEF, etc); 
       </li>
  <li> the STATISTIC macros (see mpm.h); </li>
  <li> the METER macros and meter subsystem; </li>
  <li> the &lt;type&gt;Describe() methods. </li>
</ul>


<h2 id="related-systems"> Related Systems </h2>

<p>
The MPS diagnostic system is separate from the following other MPS 
systems:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> The <strong>telemetry-log-events system</strong> 
       (which emits much more data, 
       in a less human-readable form, requires MPS-aware external 
       tools, and is more stable from release to release).  
       In non-diagnostic varieties, the telemetry-log-events system 
       emits events that log all normal MPS actions.  In diagnostic 
       varieties, it may emit additional events containing 
       diagnostic information.  
       Additionally, the telemetry-log-events stream 
       might in future be available as a channel for emitting 
       human-readable text diagnostics. 
       See also <a href="../design/telemetry/">design/telemetry</a>.
       </li>
  <li> The <strong>MPS message system</strong>
       (which is present in all varieties, and 
       manages asynchronous communication from the MPS to the client 
       program). However, the MPS message system might in future also 
       be available as a channel for emitting diagnostics. 
       See also <a href="../design/message/">design/message</a>.
       </li>
</ul>

<p>
It must be possible to add, modify, or remove diagnostics to affect 
diagnostic varieties, without a substantial secondary effect 
on non-diagnostic varieties.  It is not a requirement that there 
be zero effect.
</p>

<p>
This means:
</p>
<ul>
  <li> for actual output, you must use appropriate DIAG macros 
       (which compile away to nothing in non-diagnostic varieties); 
       </li>
  <li> for propagating and synthesising data, use appropriate 
       DIAG macros where it is reasonably clean to do so, such as for 
       local variables and statements used only for diagnostic output; 
       </li>
  <li> where it is clearer, and without substantial secondary effect, 
       to include code (such as additional function parameters) in 
       all varieties, that's okay. </li>
</ul>
