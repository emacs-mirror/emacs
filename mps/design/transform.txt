Introduction
------------

This document describes the Transform mechanism of the Memory Pool System.
Transforms allow the client code to replace a set of object references on the
heap.

The readership of this document is any developer intending to modify the
Transform implementation.


Background
----------

Göran Rydqvist of Configura originally expressed the requirement for the
MPS to support the change of layout of objects in CET [GR_2010-02-25]_.
Ravenbrook proposed several methods [RHSK_2010-09-21]_ including:

    If you need to add fields, then use a special new MPS function (that
    doesn't exist yet)::

        mps_arena_transform_objects(&my_transform_function);

    This traverses the object graph, lets your transform_function
    basically ``realloc()`` the field-block, and MPS fixes up all
    references from other objects to point to the new field-block.

    Unfortunately, this idea is probably killed off by ambiguous
    references :-(. You could only run the patch if you could
    *guarantee* there are no ambiguous refs you want. In other words,
    any object refs on the stack would become instant death (or worse:
    subtle slow death :-). Therefore we don't really like this idea
    (unfortunately). There are safer and simpler ways to do it, we
    think...

which Configura selected [GR_2010-09-22]_.

An initial implementation was made by RHSK and released to Configura as
"experimental", however Configura put it into production.

During work on adapting the MPS to 64-bit Windows, RB reformed and
reimplemented transforms based on RHSK's original work.


Overview
--------

The client program builds a table mapping "old" references to "new" ones
in a ``Transform`` object. This is then "applied", causing a garbage
collection trace in which the fix function is substituted by
``transformFix()``, which spots "old" references and replaces them with
"new" ones, in addition to applying the usual garbage collection fix
function.

This design was arrived at after some pain.  The MPS isn't really
designed for generalized transformation of the object graph, and the
pools generally assume that they're doing a garbage collection when
they're asked to condemn, scan, fix, and reclaim stuff.  This makes it
very hard to apply the transform without also doing a garbage
collection.  Changing this would require a significant reworking of
the MPS to generalise its ideas, and would bloat the pool classes.


Not yet written
---------------

* Ambiguous references and aborting the transform.

* How ambiguous references are avoided using ``arena->stackWarm``.

* How the implementation is an add-on to the MPS.

* How the code is kept separate from the mainstream MPS.

* Why it has its own hash table implementation (no good reason).

* Why it does a garbage collection and not just a transforming scan.

* Nice side-effect is that "old" objects are killed.

* Why the arena must be parked (see impl.c.trans.park).
