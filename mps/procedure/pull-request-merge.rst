1. Introduction
---------------

This document contains a procedure for merging a branch received via a
GitHub "pull request".

This document was created as a combination of the process improvement
steps from our Perforce-based "Memory Pool System branching and
merging procedures" [GDR_2014-01-09]_ with Gareth Rees' email
containing the working steps for git / GitHub merges, "Re: Possible
MPS Help" [GDR_2020-09-03]_ .

The document is still draft.  Some of the questions that need
resolving are noted in square brackets.

Ravenbrook is currently (2023-01) migrating the MPS project to git
(and GitHub) and this is likely to modify this procedure.  [Insert
reference to that project.  RB 2023-01-07]


2. Pre-merge checklist
----------------------

#. Is there a permanent visible document (issue, job), referenced by
   the branch, recording the problem that is solved by the changes in
   the branch?

#. Does the branch solve the problem?

#. Is there an automated test case that demonstrates the problem
   (without the branch) and that that the problem is solved (with the
   branch)?

#. If there are interface changes, are they documented?

#. If the changes are significant and user-visible, is there an update
   to the release notes (``manual/source/release.rst``)?

#. Has there been a code review?

#. Does the branch build and pass tests on all target platforms?
   [This may be validated by Travis CI.  Insert details here.  RB
   2023-01-07]

#. Does the branch merge cleanly into the masters?  If not, consider a
   catch-up merge from the masters.  [This may be validated by GitHub
   and/or Travis CI.  Insert details here.  RB 2023-01-07] [This is
   duplicated by step 3 of the procedure.  RB 2023-01-07]

#. Does a merge of the branch with master build and pass tests on all
   target platforms?  [This may be validated by Travis CI.  Insert
   details here.  RB 2023-01-07]

[Checklist items for Customer-specific branches from branch-merge.rst
omitted for now.  RB 2023-01-07]


3. Prerequisite steps
---------------------

These steps will only rarely need repeating.

#. Ensure your public key is in Perforce at
   //.git-fusion/users/USER/keys/ in Perforce, submitting it if
   necessary.

#. Ensure your e-mail address is in Perforce at
   //.git-fusion/users/p4gf_usermap in Perforce and matches your
   Perforce user record, submitting it if necessary.

#. Clone the Ravenbrook MPS GitHub repository and name the remote
   "github", giving (inter alia) access to Travis CI to build and test
   the merge. ::

     git clone -o github git@github.com:Ravenbrook/mps.git

#. Add the Git Fusion mps-public repo, which is the interface to
   Ravenbrook's Perforce. ::

     git remote add ravenbrook ssh://git@perforce.ravenbrook.com:1622/mps-public


4. Merging a development branch
-------------------------------

1. Check that the contributor has not expressed any kind of variation
   on the licensing of their work from the material to which they are
   contributing.  (See `"Licensing" in "Contributing to the MPS"
   <../contributing.rst#licensing>`_.)

   If they have, this procedure fails.  Talk to them or get someone to
   talk to them about the matter.

2. If the branch to be merged is in a third-party repo (such as a
   fork), then add that, e.g.::

     git remote add captain-contrib https://gitlab.com/captcontrib/mps.git

3. Fetch the branch that you are going to merge to a local branch
   using the MPS durable branch naming convention,
   "branch/DATE/TOPIC", e.g. ::

     git fetch captain-contrib mps-speed-hax:branch/2023-01-06/speed-hax

   Double check you've got this right.  Using the wrong branch naming
   `causes permanent pollution in the Ravenbrook Perforce repository
   <https://info.ravenbrook.com/mail/2023/01/07/15-06-41/0/>`_.

4. Optionally, let other people know that you're about to merge into
   master, and negotiate to avoid racing them to step 9 and making
   extra work for everyone.

5. Merge master with the branch::

     git checkout branch/2023-01-06/speed-hax
     git pull ravenbrook master:master
     git merge master

   You may need to resolve conflicts.  If you can't resolve conflicts
   yourself, you may need to involve the original author of the
   branch.  If you still can't resolve conflicts, this procedure
   fails.

   [What would be the default outcome from the GitHub interface, using
   the "merge" button?  [Chaser324_2017]_ claims it only works for
   fast-forwards, which we don't want, because they discard records of
   the merge happening, including who did it.  RB 2023-01-07]

6. Build and test the results locally.  For example::

     make -C code -f lii6gc.gmk testci testansi testpollnone testmmqa

   See `design.mps.tests <../design/tests.txt>`_ for details and other
   platforms.

   If tests do not pass, review your conflict resolution from step 5,
   and if that doesn't resolve things, the procedure fails, and you
   need to go back to the source of the branch, e.g. the pull request
   and its original author.  Something's wrong!

7. Push the branch to the Ravenbrook MPS GitHub repository to trigger
   building and testing on all target platforms using Travis CI. ::

     git push github branch/2023-01-06/speed-hax:branch/2023-01-06/speed-hax

   You will need to wait for results from Travis CI.  [Add details of
   how to see them.  RB 2023-07-01]

   See step 6 about what to do if tests do not pass.

   Note: This potentially creates a branch in the GitHub repo ahead
   of Git Fusion doing so, but it will the same name, because of the
   Git Fusion mapping, and so the result is the same as if it had come
   in via Perforce.

8. Replace the master with your branch, effecting the merge::

     git checkout master
     git merge --ff-only branch/2023-01-06/speed-hax

   The ``--ff-only`` flag ensures there have been no changes on master
   since step 5, so that the testing is valid for master, and we do
   not create a second merge commit.  If this fails, go back to
   step 5.

9. Push master and the branch to Perforce via Git Fusion::

     git push ravenbrook master branch/2023-01-06/speed-hax

   If this fails because someone has submitted changes to the master
   codeline since you started, pull those changes and go back to step
   5. ::

     git pull ravenbrook master

10. After a bit [how long? RB 2023-01-07] check that gitpushbot has
    pushed the result to the Ravenbrook MPS repo on GitHub.  [And do
    what if it doesn't?  RB 2023-01-07]
