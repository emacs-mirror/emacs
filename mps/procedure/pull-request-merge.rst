1. Introduction
---------------

This document contains a procedure for merging a branch received via a
GitHub "pull request".

This document was created as a combination of the process improvement
steps from our Perforce-based "Memory Pool System branching and
merging procedures" [GDR_2014-01-09]_ with Gareth Rees' email
containing the working steps for git / GitHub merges, "Re: Possible
MPS Help" [GDR_2020-09-03]_ .

The document is still draft.  Some of the questions that need
resolving are noted in square brackets.

Ravenbrook is currently (2023-01) migrating the MPS project to git
(and GitHub) and this is likely to modify this procedure.  [Insert
reference to that project.  RB 2023-01-07]


2. Pre-merge checklist
----------------------

#. Is there a document (issue, job) recording the problem that is
   solved by the changes in the branch?

#. Does the branch solve the problem?

#. Is there an automated test case that demonstrates that the problem
   is solved?

#. If there are interface changes, is there documentation?

#. If the changes are significant and user-visible, have you updated
   the release notes (``manual/source/release.rst``)?

#. Has there been a code review?

#. Does the branch build and pass tests on all target platforms?
   [This may be validated by Travis CI.  Insert details here.  RB
   2023-01-07]

#. Does the branch merge cleanly into the masters?  If not, consider a
   catch-up merge from the masters.  [This may be validated by GitHub
   and/or Travis CI.  Insert details here.  RB 2023-01-07]

#. Does a merge of the branch with master build and pass tests on all
   target platforms?  [This may be validated by Travis CI.  Insert
   details here.  RB 2023-01-07]

[Checklist items for Customer-specific branches from branch-merge.rst
omitted for now.  RB 2023-01-07]


3. Prerequisite steps
---------------------

#. Ensure your public key is in //.git-fusion/users/USER/keys/ in
   Perforce, submitting it if necessary.

#. Ensure your e-mail address is in //.git-fusion/users/p4gf_usermap
   in Perforce and matches your Perforce user record, submitting it if
   necessary.

#. Clone the Ravenbrook MPS GitHub repository and name the remote
   "github", giving (inter alia) access to Travis CI to build and test
   the merge. ::

     git clone -o github git@github.com:Ravenbrook/mps.git

#. Add the Git Fusion mps-public repo, which is the interface to
   Ravenbrook's Perforce. ::

     git remote add ravenbrook ssh://git@perforce.ravenbrook.com:1622/mps-public

#. If the branch to be merged is in a third-party repo (such as a
   fork), then add that, e.g.::

     git remote add captain-contrib https://gitlab.com/captcontrib/mps.git


4. Merging a development branch
-------------------------------

1. Ensure that the contributor has executed the appropriate assignment
   of copyright.  If they haven't, this procedure fails.  Talk to them
   or get someone to talk to them.  [This needs updating now that the
   MPS is using the BSD licence.  e.g. We mustn't accept GPL code.  RB
   2023-01-07]

2. Fetch the branch that you are going to merge, e.g.::

     git fetch captain-contrib mps-speed-hax

3. Make an equivalent local branch using the MPS durable branch naming
   convention, "branch/DATE/TOPIC", e.g.::

     git checkout -b branch/2023-01-06/speed-hax captain-contrib/mps-speed-hax

   Double check you've got this right.  Using the wrong branch naming
   `causes permanent pollution in the Ravenbrook Perforce repository
   <https://info.ravenbrook.com/mail/2023/01/07/15-06-41/0/>`_.

4. Merge master with the branch::

     git merge ravenbrook/master

   You may need to resolve conflicts.  If you can't resolve conflicts
   yourself, you may need to involve the original author of the
   branch.  If you still can't resolve conflicts, this procedure
   fails.

   [What would be the default outcome from the GitHub interface,
   using the "merge" button?  Can we allow that?  RB 2023-01-07]

5. Build and test the results locally.  For example::

     make -C code -f lii6gc.gmk testci testansi testpollnone testmmqa

   See `design.mps.tests`_ for details and other platforms.

.. _`design.mps.tests`: ../design/tests.txt

   If tests do not pass, review your conflict resolution from step 4,
   and if that doesn't resolve things, the procedure fails, and you
   need to go back to the source of the branch, e.g. the pull request
   and its original author.  Something's wrong!

6. Push the branch to the Ravenbrook MPS GitHub repository to trigger
   building and testing on all target platforms using Travis CI. ::

     git push github branch/2023-01-06/speed-hax:branch/2023-01-06/speed-hax

   You will need to wait for results from Travis CI.  [Add details of
   how to see them.  RB 2023-07-01] [Some sort of
   ``--force-with-lease`` option may be required if we're pushing back
   to the same branch we started with, such as when it's a Ravenbrook
   development branch.  RB 2023-07-01]

   See step 5 about what to do if tests do not pass.

   Note: This potentially creates a branch in the GitHub repo ahead
   of Git Fusion doing so, but it will the same name, because of the
   Git Fusion mapping, and so the result is the same as if it had come
   in via Perforce.

7. Replace the master with your branch, effecting the merge::

     git checkout master
     git merge --ff-only branch/2023-01-06/speed-hax

   [There should not have been any further changes on master, and
   ``--ff-only`` checks for that.  The merge commit we want on master
   is made in step 4.  RB 2023-01-07]

8. Push master and the branch to Perforce via Git Fusion::

     git push ravenbrook master branch/2023-01-06/speed-hax

   If this fails because someone else has submitted changes to the
   master codeline since you started, pull those changes and go back
   to step 4 ::

     git pull ravenbrook master

9. After a bit [how long? RB 2023-01-07] check that gitpushbot has
   pushed the result to the Ravenbrook MPS repo on GitHub.  [And do
   what if it doesn't?  RB 2023-01-07]
