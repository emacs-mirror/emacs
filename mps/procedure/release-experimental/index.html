<h2><a id="section-1" name="section-1">1. Introduction</a></h2>

<p> This is the procedure for making an experimental release of the Memory Pool System. </p>

<p>An experimental release is a quick way to make under-development MPS
code available to external parties for testing.  Such releases aren't
part of a formal chain of supported releases and are only tested prior
to shipping to the degree required by the experiment.
See <a href="#Justification">Justification</a>, below.</p>

<p> Readership of this document is Ravenbrook development staff.
(If you are a user of the MPS, and want to build object code from
an mps-kit, please see the readme.txt file in the kit). </p>

<p> This document is not confidential. </p>


<h2><a id="section-2" name="section-2">2. Procedure</a></h2>


<h3><a id="section-2.1" name="section-2.1">2.1. Prepare your modified MPS source</a></h3>

<p>
Experimental releases come from a task codeline and the released
material is stored in that codeline:
<code>branch/YYYY-MM-DD/NAME/</code>.
(In the rest of this procedure, relative paths assume that this is your
current directory).
</p>


<h3><a id="section-2.2" name="section-2.2">2.2. Determine release name and origin</a></h3>

<p>An experimental release's name is the Perforce changelevel of its
origin, prefixed with "<code>exp-</code>".</p>

<p>The following procedure is cheap and usually works,
despite the race condition.</p>

<ol>

<li>
<p> <kbd>p4 changes -m 1</kbd>, add 1:
this is the expected changelevel NNNNNN for your experimental release.
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Edit <code>code/version.c</code>: set MPS_RELEASE to
<code>"exp-NNNNNN"</code>.
</p>
</li>

<li><p>Submit <code>code/version.c</code>.</p></li>

<li>
<p>
Inspect the output from the submission to ensure that you got the
changelist number you expected.  If you missed this for some reason,
try <kbd>p4 changes -m1 code/...#have</kbd>, which will show the highest
changelist number for the code that you have synced.
</p>
</li>

</ol>

<p>
If someone else grabbed your intended changelevel, repeat until you win.
</p>


<h3><a id="section-2.3" name="section-2.3">2.3. Make the release package</a></h3>

<p> This example is for an experimental release to Configura. </p>

<ol>

<li>
<p>
Check that you have no opened files in the code directory.  If you have,
either submit or revert them.
</p>
</li>

<li>
Ensure that the SDK build environment is configured in this console
window.  This can be done using
<kbd>code/configure_sdk</kbd>
</li>

<li>
<p> Clean directory, Sync to origin, Build:</p>
<kbd>
P4 sync code/...#none<br />
RMDIR/S/Q code<br />
P4 sync code/...@<var>NNNNNN</var><br />
PUSHD code<br />
NTBUILD exp-<var>NNNNNN</var><br />
</kbd>
</li>

<li>
Note that in previous incarnations of the MPS, the build was with
earlier versions of MS Visual C installed in a specific location and
the build sequence was:
<pre>
\vc6path.bat
w3build.bat
\vc9vars.bat
w3vc9.bat
</pre>
<p>
The old build command procedures are retained in case we wish to
reproduce these builds, but they should be considered obsolete and will
be removed in due course.
</p>
</li>

<li>
The build step should have produced two new subdirectories:
<dl>
<dt>w3i3mv</dt>
<dd>Contains all the generated files from the build;</dd>
<dt>exp-<var>NNNNNN</var></dt>
<dd>A release directory explicitly populated by the build command
procedure with the artefacts we want to ship.</dd>
</dl>
</li>

<li>
Run the standard smoke tests for the release with the command:
<kbd>../tool/test-runner</kbd>
<p>
Note that this is actually a source level test - it isn't explicitly
testing the contents of the release directory because the current
release manifest doesn't include a mechanism to do that.
</p>
<p>
The test-runner program builds and executes a number of tests in each
of the four build variants we produce.  The results are written to a
file called <code>a1.txt</code> in the current directory.
Inspect this file to check that no unexpected errors occurred.
</p>

<li>
<p>
Make a Zip Archive, in the local release directory.  The example below
uses the 7-ZIP utility, but a similar result can be achieved
with the Info-ZIP utility, if preferred.</p>
<pre>
if not exist ..\release\nul md ..\release
7z a ..\release\MMconfigura-exp-<var>NNNNNN</var>.ZIP .\exp-<var>NNNNNN</var>\*
</pre>
<p>
Also archive the test log file:
<pre>
7z a ..\release\exp-<var>NNNNNN</var>_test_log.ZIP a1.txt
</pre>
</p>

  <p> <code>release/</code> is a new "branch release directory", a peer of the /code directory.  It is only present in branches from which we make experimental releases.  Experimentally released files go here, for example: //info.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/branch/2007-04-18/diag/release/MMconfigura-exp-162399.zip.</p>
</li>

<li><p> Add to perforce: </p>
  <blockquote>
  <pre><code>
  p4 add -t binary ..\release\MMconfigura-exp-162399.ZIP
  p4 add -t binary ..\release\exp-162399_test_log.ZIP
  p4 submit
  </code></pre></blockquote>
  <p>or equivalent.</p>
</li>

</ol>


<h3><a id="section-2.4" name="section-2.4">2.4. Test and Publish</a></h3>

<ol>

<li>
Test as appropriate.  For example, check that the ZIP file
contents appear similar in number and size to a previous release that's
known to be sound.
</li>

<li>
Update the release list in
<code>
//info.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/release/index.html
</code>
with details of the release you are making.
</li>

<li>
If necessary, make the webserver allow access to the release:
see <a href="http://info.ravenbrook.com/procedure/webserver/"
>http://info.ravenbrook.com/procedure/webserver/</a>
for details of what's involved.
</li>

<li>
Send mail, including your (informal) release notes, and a link to the
release on
<strong>www.ravenbrook.com</strong>...zip
(<em>not</em> info.ravenbrook.com!).
</li>

</ol>


<h2><a id="section-3" name="section-3">3. Justification and Design</a></h2>


<p>An experimental release is a cheap and quick way to make under-development MPS code available to external parties (eg. customers), typically to let them evaluate new functionality. </p>

<p>This procedure was designed by simplifying and removing steps from the formal release-build procedure.  For design justification, see <a href="http://info.ravenbrook.com/mail/2007/05/23/17-34-46/0.txt">http://info.ravenbrook.com/mail/2007/05/23/17-34-46/0.txt</a> and <a href="http://info.ravenbrook.com/mail/2007/05/24/12-40-54/0.txt">http://info.ravenbrook.com/mail/2007/05/24/12-40-54/0.txt</a>.</p>
