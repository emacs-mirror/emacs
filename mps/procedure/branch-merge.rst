1. Introduction
---------------

This document contains procedures and checklists for branching and merging during the ordinary course of development. For making version branches, see `version-create`_, and for making releases, see `release-build`_.

.. _version-create: version-create
.. _release-build: release-build


2. Pre-branch checklist
-----------------------

#. Have you created a job recording the problem you are planning to
   solve on the development branch?


3. Creating a development branch (automated procedure)
------------------------------------------------------

Run the script ``tool/branch``, passing the options:

* ``-P mps`` — project name
* ``-p PARENT`` — parent branch: for example ``master`` or ``custom/cet/main``
* ``-C CHANGELEVEL`` — changelevel at which to make the branch
* ``-t TASK`` — task name: for example ``lii6ll``
* ``-d "DESCRIPTION"`` — the description of the branch
* ``-y`` — yes, really create the branch

If omitted, the project and parent branch are deduced from the current
directory, and the changelevel defaults to the most recent change on
the parent branch. So a typical invocation looks like this::

    tool/branch -p master -t lii6ll -d "Adding new supported platform lii6ll (job003596)." -y


4. Creating a development branch (manual procedure)
---------------------------------------------------

#. Create a branch specification. For example::

        p4 branch mps/branch/2013-08-21/lii6ll

   The specification should look like this::

        Branch:	mps/branch/2013-08-21/lii6ll

        Description:
                Adding new supported platform lii6ll (job003596).

        View:
                //info.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/master/... //info.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/branch/2013-08-21/lii6ll/...

#. If you're working on a problem that's specific to a customer, then
   map the mainline for that customer rather than the master sources::

        View:
                //info.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/custom/cet/main/... //info.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/branch/2013-11-04/cet-i6-stack-probe/...

#. Populate the branch::

        p4 populate -b mps/branch/2013-08-21/lii6ll -d "Branching to add new supported platform lii6ll (job003596)."

#. Edit the index of branches::

        p4 edit //info.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/branch/index.html

   and add an entry to the "Active branches" section.


5. Pre-merge checklist
----------------------

#. Have you solved the problem?

#. Is there an automated test case?

#. Does the test suite pass on all supported platforms?

#. If there are interface changes, is there documentation?

#. If the changes are significant and user-visible, have you updated
   the release notes (``master/manual/source/release.rst``)?

#. If this is work on a customer-specific branch, and you've added new
   customer-specific interfaces, have you ensured that these
   interfaces are separated from the public interfaces?

#. If this is work on a customer-specific branch, and you've added new
   files that should be merged into the mainline for that customer,
   but not into the master sources, have these files been excluded in
   the branch specification for that customer?

#. Has there been a code review?


6. Merging a development branch
-------------------------------

#. Do a catch-up merge from the master sources (or the appropriate
   customer-specific mainline)::

         BRANCH=mps/branch/2013-08-21/lii6ll
         p4 integrate -b $BRANCH
         p4 resolve -as
         p4 resolve

#. Check that the test suite passes on the branch.

#. Submit the merged files::

         p4 submit -d "Catch-up merge from the master sources to $BRANCH"

#. Update the branch on all supported platforms and check that the
   test suite passes.

#. Backward merge into the master sources (or the appropriate
   customer-specific mainline)::

         p4 integrate -r -b $BRANCH
         p4 resolve -as
         p4 resolve

   Note: don't cherry-pick individual lines from files, if at all
   possible. (It may not be possible in the case of makefiles.) Try to
   structure changes so that files can be included or excluded as a
   whole.

#. Check that the test suite passes on the master sources.

#. Submit the merged files::

         p4 submit -d "Merge $BRANCH into the master sources"

#. Create a fix record for the change you just submitted::

         p4 fix -c CHANGE JOB

#. Edit the branch index, moving the development branch from the
   "Active branches" to "Dormant branches" section and linking the
   change in which the branch was merged.
