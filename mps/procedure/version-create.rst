1. Introduction
---------------

This document tells you how to create a new version from the master
sources. (For example, if the last version of the MPS is 1.105, with
releases 1.105.0 and 1.105.1, this document tells you how to abandon the
1.105 lineage and take a new clone from the master sources to create
version 1.106).

Refer to "Product Quality Through Change Management" [RB_1999-05-20]
for background, terminology, rationale, and usage guidance. This tells
you what "a version" actually is.


2. Preamble
-----------

2.1. Do I need this procedure?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You might not need to create a new version. An alternative is to
create a further "point release" on the existing version. Refer to
[RB_1999-05-20] when deciding. (Summary: if changing the
specification, make a new version; if improving the product against an
unchanged specification, make a point release.)


2.2. What is a version?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A version is a clone of all the master sources, that has its own
evolution. A version has these parts:

#. The **version branch specification**, which defines the mapping used
   to integrate from the master sources to the version sources. By
   convention, the name of the branch specification is
   ``mps/version/A.BBB`` so that it exactly matches the path name of
   the version's sub-tree. For example::

        $ p4 branch -o mps/version/1.105
        ...
        View:
                //info.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/master/... //info.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/version/1.105/...
        ...

#. The **version sources**, in the ``version/A.BBB/...`` sub-tree.
   Usually these are clones of the master sources, and were created in
   a single change with ``p4 integrate -b BRANCH``. Some files may
   then be further modified.

#. The **version origin**, the last change on the master sources that
   made it into the version sources by virtue of the initial integrate
   command.

#. An entry in the `table of versions <https://info.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/version/>`_.


3. Procedure: How to make a new version
---------------------------------------

#. Make sure that the sources for the version you are about to create,
   and for the table of versions, are mapped in your Perforce client.

#. Update the following files in the master sources that contain a
   version number, so that they refer to the version that you are
   about to create::

        code/version.c

   Submit these files to Perforce.

   (If there are other files that need updating, update this procedure
   and add them here. But it is better to parse the information out of
   ``code/version.c`` so that the version number is mentioned just
   once. See for example ``manual/source/conf.py``.)

#. Create the version branch specification by running::

        VERSION=A.BBB
        BRANCH=mps/version/$VERSION
        p4 branch -i <<END
        Branch: $BRANCH
        Description: Branching master sources for version $VERSION.
        View: //info.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/master/... //info.ravenbrook.com/project/$BRANCH/...
        END

#. Make sure you have no unsubmitted files::

        $ p4 opened
        File(s) not opened on this client.

   and then::

        p4 integrate -b $BRANCH
        p4 submit -d "Branching master sources for version $VERSION."

#. Determine the origin of the new version::

        p4 changes -m 5 //info.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/master/...

   Note the latest change that was in before the integrate.

#. Update the `table of versions <https://info.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/version/>`_.

#. Edit ``configure.ac`` on the version branch, replacing ``[master]``
   with ``[version A.BBB]``, and then submit it::

        p4 submit -d "Update 'master' to 'version $VERSION'"

   (If there are other files that need updating, update this procedure
   and add them here. But it is better to organize the sources so that
   this is not necessary.)

#. Do an empty integrate of this change back on to the masters, so
   Perforce knows that it's not wanted::

        p4 integrate -r -b $BRANCH
        p4 resolve -ay
        p4 submit -d "Ignoring update of 'master' to 'version $VERSION' from version branch"
