1. Introduction
---------------

This document tells you how to create a new version from the master
sources. (For example, if the last version of the MPS is 1.105, with
releases 1.105.0 and 1.105.1, this document tells you how to abandon the
1.105 lineage and take a new clone from the master sources to create
version 1.106).

Refer to "Product Quality Through Change Management" [RB_1999-05-20]
for background, terminology, rationale, and usage guidance. This tells
you what "a version" actually is.


2. Preamble
-----------

2.1. Do I need this procedure?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You might not need to create a new version. An alternative is to
create a further "point release" on the existing version. Refer to
[RB_1999-05-20] when deciding. (Summary: if changing the
specification, make a new version; if improving the product against an
unchanged specification, make a point release.)


2.2. What is a version?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A version is a clone of all the master sources, that has its own
evolution. A version has these parts:

#. The **version branch specification**, which defines the mapping used
   to integrate from the master sources to the version sources. By
   convention, the name of the branch specification is
   ``mps/version/A.BBB`` so that it exactly matches the path name of
   the version's sub-tree. For example::

        $ p4 branch -o mps/version/1.105
        ...
        View:
                //info.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/master/... //info.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/version/1.105/...
        ...

#. The **version sources**, in the ``version/A.BBB/...`` sub-tree.
   Usually these are clones of the master sources, and were created in
   a single change with ``p4 integrate -b BRANCH``. Some files may
   then be further modified.

#. The **version origin**, the last change on the master sources that
   made it into the version sources by virtue of the initial integrate
   command.

#. An entry in the `table of versions <https://info.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/version/>`_.


3. Procedure: How to make a new version
---------------------------------------


3.1. Pre-branch checklist
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Are you an authenticated Git Fusion user? If not, follow the
   git-fusion_ procedure.

   .. _git-fusion: /procedure/git-fusion

#. Does ``code/version.c`` in the master sources contain the correct
   value for the ``MPS_RELEASE`` macro? It should be the name of the
   first release from the version you are about to create. If it is
   wrong, correct and submit it.


3.2. Automated procedure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run the script ``tool/branch``, passing the options:

* ``-P mps`` — project name
* ``-p master`` — parent branch
* ``-C CHANGELEVEL`` — changelevel at which to make the branch
* ``-v`` — request a version branch
* ``-d "DESCRIPTION"`` — description of the branch
* ``-y`` — yes, really create the branch

If omitted, the project and parent branch are deduced from the current
directory, and the changelevel defaults to the most recent change on
the parent branch. A typical invocation looks like this::

    tool/branch -p master -v -d "Improved interface to generation chains." -y


3.3. Manual procedure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

#. Make sure that the sources for the version you are about to create,
   for the table of versions, and for the table of Git Fusion pushes,
   are mapped in your Perforce client::

        //info.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/version/$VERSION/...
        //info.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/branch/index.html
        //info.ravenbrook.com/infosys/robots/git-fusion/etc/pushes

#. Create the version branch specification by running::

        VERSION=A.BBB
        BRANCH=mps/version/$VERSION
        p4 branch -i <<END
        Branch: $BRANCH
        Description: Branching master sources for version $VERSION.
        View: //info.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/master/... //info.ravenbrook.com/project/$BRANCH/...
        END

#. Make sure you have no unsubmitted files::

        $ p4 opened
        File(s) not opened on this client.

   and then::

        p4 integrate -b $BRANCH
        p4 submit -d "Branching master sources for version $VERSION."

#. Determine the origin of the new version::

        p4 changes -m 5 //info.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/master/...

   Note the latest change that was in before the integrate.

#. Update the `table of versions <https://info.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/version/>`_.

#. Make a client specification that can be used by the `git-fusion robot <https://info.ravenbrook.com/infosys/robots>`_ to sync the version::

        p4 client -i <<END
        Client: git-fusion-mps-version-$VERSION
        Description: Git-fusion client for syncing MPS version $VERSION
        Root: /home/git-fusion/.git-fusion/views/mps-version-$VERSION/p4
        View: //info.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/version/$VERSION/... //git-fusion-mps-version-$VERSION/...
        END

#. Add an entry to the `list of repositories to push to GitHub <https://info.ravenbrook.com/infosys/robots/git-fusion/etc/pushes>`_::

        PUSHES=$(p4 have //info.ravenbrook.com/infosys/robots/git-fusion/etc/pushes | cut -d' ' -f3)
        p4 edit $PUSHES
        printf "mps-version-$VERSION\tgit@github.com:Ravenbrook/mps.git\tversion/$VERSION" >> $PUSHES
        p4 submit -d "Arranging for MPS version $VERSION to be pushed to GitHub by Git Fusion" $PUSHES
