1. Introduction
---------------

This document tells you how to create a new version from the master
sources. (For example, if the last version of the MPS is 1.105, with
releases 1.105.0 and 1.105.1, this document tells you how to abandon the
1.105 lineage and take a new clone from the master sources to create
version 1.106).

Background: refer to PQTCM ("Product Quality Through Change Management",
`http://www.ravenbrook.com/doc/1999/05/20/pqtcm/ <http://www.ravenbrook.com/doc/1999/05/20/pqtcm/>`__)
for background, terminology, rationale, and usage guidance. This tells
you what "a version" actually is.


2. Preamble
-----------

Do I need this procedure?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You might not need to create a new version. An alternative is to create
a further 'point release' on the existing version. Refer to PQTCM when
deciding. (Summary: am I changing the specification?).

What is a version?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A version is a 'clone' of all the master source files, that then has its
own evolution. A Version has these parts:

-  Perforce branch, defining the mapping used to integrate from master
   to version. By convention, the name of the branch is
   "mps/version/A.BBB": note that we make the branch name exactly match
   the pathname of that version's sub-tree. For example::

      $ p4 branch -o mps/version/1.105
      ...
       //info.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/master/... //info.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/version/1.105/...
      ...

-  Cloned (integrated) and submitted files, in the "version/A.BBB/..."
   sub-tree. Usually this is a clone of the entire "master" subtree and
   all its files. These were created in a single change with "p4
   integrate -b <branchspec>". This initial integrate is what populates
   the version branch with files; before that it was empty. For each of
   these files, Perforce reports the first action as "branch". Some
   files may then be further modified.

-  Origin: The point in time that the initial integrate was performed,
   expressed as its changelevel minus one, defines the "Origin" of the
   version. The Origin is the last change on the master sources that
   also made it into the version sources by virtue of the initial
   integrate command.

3. Procedure: How to make a new version
---------------------------------------

0. Some files contain an MPS version-name. What version-name do the
*master* copies of these files contain? It depends. Some contain the
pseudo-version-name "master": you will leave these files unchanged on
master, and only update them on the version branch (see step 6 below).
Others, even in master, refer to the expected next version-name: you
should update these files before making the branch. Make these files
contain the expected new version-name, and/or information pertinent to
the new version:

- ``master/readme.txt``
- ``master/code/version.c``
- ``master/code/w3build.bat``

(check the "Setup" section of procedure/release-build for the full list
of these files) Submit these files before you continue.

1. Make the branch: p4 branch mps/version/A.BBB Description: Branching
master sources for version A.BBB. Always the whole of master::

    //info.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/master/... //info.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/version/A.BBB/...

2. Make sure you have no unsubmitted files, and then::

    p4 integrate -b mps/version/A.BBB

3. ``p4 submit``

4. Determine the Origin of the new version: do p4 changes -m 5 on the
   master, and note the latest change that was in before the integrate.

   .. Note: it's better to do it this way -- do the integrate from the
      *implicit* tip of the master, and then check back to see what
      happened -- because it's hard to get wrong. Also, then the
      integrate has the changelevel origin+1.  Clashes with master
      submits could theoretically occur, and could be avoided by
      determining the origin first and specifying it to the initial
      integrate, but in practice this never happens.

5. Update the table at <http://info.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/version/>.

6. Edit Master->Version in documents that erroneously say "Master".
   Always edit version/A.BBB/index.html, e.g. (case-sensitive)::

       "of the Master version"  ->  "of Version A.BBB"
       "Master"  ->  "Version A.BBB"

   Less importantly, edit various other files. See change 30260.

7. Do an empty-integrate of this change back on to the masters, so P4
   thinks it's done and doesn't keep suggesting it::

       p4 integrate -r -b mps/version/A.BBB <Files Edited Master->Version>
       p4 resolve -ay <Files Edited Master->Version>
