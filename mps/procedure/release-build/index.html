<h2><a id="section-1" name="section-1">1. Introduction</a></h2>

<p> This is the procedure for building a release of the Memory Pool System from the version sources. </p>

<p> The readership of this document is anyone developing the integration. </p>

<p> This document is not confidential. </p>

<h2><a id="section-2" name="section-2">2. Procedure</a></h2>


<h3><a id="section-2.1" name="section-2.1">2.1. Setting up for release</a></h3>

<ol>

<li><p> Choose a release name of the form "VERSION.N" (for example,
0.3.0). VERSION is the number of the version you're releasing.  N is the
first unused release number (starting at zero).  Look in the index of
releases (release/index.html) for existing release numbers for your
version. </p></li>

<li><p> Ensure that <code>version/<i>VERSION</i>/readme.txt</code>
contains an up-to-date description of the release you intend to build
and the correct release name. </p> </li>

<li><p> <strong>Submit <code>readme.txt</code> to Perforce
before you continue.</strong> </p></li>

<li><p> Determine the changelevel at which you're going to make the
release.  This should be the current changelevel; use <code>p4 counter
change</code> to get it. </p></li>

</ol>


<h3><a id="section-2.2" name="section-2.2">2.2. MPS Kit Tarball</a></h3>

<p> On a Unix box: </p>

<ol>

<li>

  <p> Sync the version sources to the changelevel you determined in step 2.1.  Sync the version sources to a clean area of the disk, to be sure that there are no extraneous files around. </p>

  <blockquote> <code>
    p4 sync version/VERSION/...#none <br />
    rm -rf version/VERSION <br />
    p4 sync version/VERSION/...@CHANGELEVEL
  </code> </blockquote>

</li>

<li>

  <p> Create a tarball containing the MPS sources: </p>

  <blockquote><code>
    cp -r version/VERSION mps-kit-RELEASE <br />
    tar cf - mps-kit-RELEASE | gzip -c &gt; release/RELEASE/mps-kit-RELEASE.tar.gz <br />
    rm -r mps-kit-RELEASE
  </code></blockquote>

</li>

<li> <p> Add the tarball to Perforce with the comment "Adding the MPS Kit tarball for release RELEASE." </p> </li>

</ol>


<h3><a id="section-2.3" name="section-2.3">2.3. MPS Kit Zip file</a></h3>

<p> On a Window box: </p>

<ol>

<li> <p> Sync the version sources to the changelevel you determined in step 2.1.  Sync the version sources to a clean area of the disk, to be sure that there are no extraneous files around. </p> </li>

<li> <p> Launch WinZip and create a new archive called "mps-kit-RELEASE.zip" in the directory "release/RELEASE".  Add the MPS sources by selecting "version/VERSION" and turning on "Include subfolders" option. </p> </li>

<li> <p> Make a self-extracting archive called "mps-kit-RELEASE.exe" from "mps-kit-RELEASE.zip" (in the same directory), by selcting Actions &rarr; Make .EXE File.  Specify the default "unzip to" folder as "mps-kit-RELEASE". </p> </li>

<li> <p> Add the self-extracting archive to Perforce with the comment "Adding the MPS Kit zip file for release RELEASE." </p> </li>

</ol>


<h3><a id="section-2.4" name="section-2.4">2.4. Registering the release</a></h3>

<ol>

<li><p> Edit the index of releases (<code>release/index.html</code>) and
add the release to the table, in a manner consistent with previous
releases. </p></li>

<li><p> Edit the index of versions (<code>version/index.html</code>) and
add the release to the list of releases for VERSION, in a manner
consistent with previous releases. </p></li>

<li><p> Edit the
<code>//info.ravenbrook.com/infosys/cgi/issue.cgi</code> script to add
the release changelevel to the <code>releases</code> table, so that the
correct set of known and fixed issues can be derived. </p></li>

<li><p> Submit these changes with the comment "Registered release
RELEASE."  </p></li>

<li><p> Inform the project manager and staff by e-mail to <a
href="mailto:mps-staff@ravenbrook.com">mps-staff@ravenbrook.com</a>. </p></li>
