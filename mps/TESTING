			    How to test MPS
			    ---------------

When you first build MPS on your system, it is advisable to run the MPS
test suite, to make sure the library is working on your platform and
configuration.  This file gives short "cook-book style" instructions for
how to do that.

First, build the MP library locally, as described in manual/build.txt,
under "Running make".  For example, for 64-bit GNU/Linux using x86_64
and GCC:

  $ cd code
  $ make -f lii6gc.gmk

This builds the mps.a library locally in the subdirectories of 'code',
and also builds several test programs.

Then you can run the test suite.  On Posix systems:

  $ cd code
  $ make -f <platform>.gmk <test-suite>

On MS-Windows:

  > cd code
  > ..\tool\testrun.bat <platform> <variety> <test-suite>

Here:
       <platform>   is as used in the build above, but without the .gmk
                    extension (e.g., lii6gc for 64-bit GNU/Linux+GCC,
                    w3i6gc for 64-bit MinGW build on Windows, etc.)
       <test-suite> is the part of the test suite to run, see below
       <variety>    is either "cool" or "hot"; we suggest running both

The important test suites to use are:

  testrun -- the so-called "smoke tests", a subset of tests that quickly
             checks that main functionalities of MPS are working
  testci  -- all of the tests that are known to pass
  testall -- all the tests, even those known to fail

There are additional test subsets, and it is also possible to run the
tests only on the "cool" or the "hot" builds of the library.  See the
file design/tests.txt for more details.
