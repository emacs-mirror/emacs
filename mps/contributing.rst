=======================
Contributing to the MPS
=======================

We are very happy to receive contributions to the Memory Pool System so
that we can improve it for everyone.


Review
------

The MPS is highly engineered and rigorously controlled in order to
prevent defects.  This approach has lead to an extremely small number of
bugs in production since its first commercial use in 1997.  There are a
fairly large number of rules, both low- and high-level that your code
must follow in order to be accepted.  These rules are the result of
continuous process improvement to prevent defects.  Unfortunately, we do
not have many of them published at present.  We apologise if you find it
frustrating that we do not accept your changes as they are.

The style guide in guide.impl.c.format_ contains basic rules for style.

Thank you

Finally, thank you for making the MPS more useful to everyone.
