    <h1>The "doc" Document Type</h1>

   </div>
   <h2>Purpose</h2>
   <p>Type "doc" is the most general type.  The form is simply the common information header described above, plus a text document.  This type is used where there is not a more specific type defined.  In this database, this type is used for protocol documents, introductory material for the Reference Manual, and sections of the User Guide.</p>
   <h2>Content</h2>
   <p>All documents have certain bits of information stored: Tag, Revision, Status, Type, Title, Creator, and CreationTime.</p>
   <p>
      Tag: The unique hierarchical identifier for the document.  Tags should be made
    <br />
           up of the characters A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and hyphen, with elements separated
       by dots (periods).  The case of characters in a tag is not significant.
    <br />
           Tags will be canonically stored as lower case.  Each document type will
       define how to choose the tag for that document.
    <br />
             In general, the tag is the name of the object that is tagged, and it
       is therefore a "noun phrase" in some sense.  For example, a bibliography
    <br />
           entry for a book is tagged "book.xxxyy" and not "bib.xxxyy".
   </p>
   <p>
      Revision: A revision number for the document.  When the doc is modified, the
    <br />
                revision number should be increased by one.  A tag may be qualified
            with a revision number (e.g. "process.rights(3)") to indicate which
    <br />
                particular version of the document is meant.  Usually, revisions are
            increased when an "accepted" (reviewed) document is modified.  The
    <br />
                new revision becomes "draft" until it is reviewed.
   </p>
   <p>
      Status: This is the stage of processing of the doc, indicating its progress
    <br />
              within the project.  See "status.*" for information about the meaning
   </p>
   <p>          of each status code.</p>
   <p>
      Type: The generic type is "doc", since all documents are "docs".  Each
    <br />
            document type has a "form" which determines the information stored
        in the document and how it is formatted.  Documents of type "doc" have
   </p>
   <p>
            the most general document form -- free text.  Where approrpriate, there
    <br />
            are more specific forms for other types which attempt to make the
        information more regular and assist its processing.  For example,
    <br />
            bibliography entries are in a particular format, and include author
        information.  The Lotus Notes implementation implements forms directly,
    <br />
            but they are basically plain text templates.
   </p>
   <p>
      Title: The title is a short description of the document in English.  The tag
    <br />
             should be enough information for the initiated to figure out what
         something is.  The title should provide enough information for the
    <br />
             uninitiated, for example, a visitor from another project looking at
         the system.
   </p>
   <p>  Creator: The creator is the person (or people) who created the document. If</p>
   <p>
               the thing is being copied from elsewhere (for example, a pre-existing
    <br />
               document or mail message) then it should be the person who created
           the information in the first place.  When a document is revised,
    <br />
               the person or people who revise it become the creators of a new
           revision of that document.
   </p>
   <p>
      CreationTime: The time at which the thing was created.  Usually this is the
    <br />
                    thing is entered into the system.  If it's being copied from
                elsewhere, try to use the original date that the information
    <br />
                    was created.  When a document is revised, a new revision is
                created, and therefore the creation time is the time of the
    <br />
                    revision.
   </p>
   <p>
    The common fields are always written at the top of a document in a particular way, as shown below.
---
    <br />
    &lt;Tag&gt;(&lt;Revision&gt;)  &lt;status&gt; &lt;type&gt;
    <br />
    &lt;blank line&gt;
    <br />
                              &lt;Upper case title&gt;
                    &lt;Creator&gt;, &lt;Creation date (ISO)&gt;

    <strong>.notes:</strong>
     The Internal Notes field is for notes that will not be published to external clients.
   </p>
   <h2>Tagging</h2>
   <p>Since "doc" is the catch-all type, there is no defined scheme for tagging.  When a document is created because there is no appropriate form in a particular area of the system, use the scheme for the documents around it.  For example, information which supplements a bibliography entry could be tagged "book.gilb93.appendix".  Choose a tag which describes the _thing_ itself, and is therefore a noun.</p>
