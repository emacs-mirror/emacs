   <h2>Purpose</h2>

   <p>Type "doc" is the most general type.  The form is simply the common information header described above, plus a text document.  This type is used where there is not a more specific type defined.  In this database, this type is used for protocol documents, introductory material for the Reference Manual, and sections of the User Guide.</p>

   <h2>Content</h2>

   <p>All documents have certain bits of information stored: Tag, Revision, Status, Type, Title, Creator, and CreationTime.</p>

   <p>

      Tag: The unique hierarchical identifier for the document.  Tags should be made

    <br />

           up of the characters A-Z, a-z, 0-9, and hyphen, with elements separated

       by dots (periods).  The case of characters in a tag is not significant.

    <br />

           Tags will be canonically stored as lower case.  Each document type will

       define how to choose the tag for that document.

    <br />

             In general, the tag is the name of the object that is tagged, and it

       is therefore a "noun phrase" in some sense.  For example, a bibliography

    <br />

           entry for a book is tagged "book.xxxyy" and not "bib.xxxyy".

   </p>

   <p>

      Revision: A revision number for the document.  When the doc is modified, the

    <br />

                revision number should be increased by one.  A tag may be qualified

            with a revision number (e.g. "process.rights(3)") to indicate which

    <br />

                particular version of the document is meant.  Usually, revisions are

            increased when an "accepted" (reviewed) document is modified.  The

    <br />

                new revision becomes "draft" until it is reviewed.

   </p>

   <p>

      Status: This is the stage of processing of the doc, indicating its progress

    <br />

              within the project.  See "status.*" for information about the meaning

   </p>

   <p>          of each status code.</p>

   <p>

      Type: The generic type is "doc", since all documents are "docs".  Each

    <br />

            document type has a "form" which determines the information stored

        in the document and how it is formatted.  Documents of type "doc" have

   </p>

   <p>

            the most general document form -- free text.  Where approrpriate, there

    <br />

            are more specific forms for other types which attempt to make the

        information more regular and assist its processing.  For example,

    <br />

            bibliography entries are in a particular format, and include author

        information.  The Lotus Notes implementation implements forms directly,

    <br />

            but they are basically plain text templates.

   </p>

   <p>

      Title: The title is a short description of the document in English.  The tag

    <br />

             should be enough information for the initiated to figure out what

         something is.  The title should provide enough information for the

    <br />

             uninitiated, for example, a visitor from another project looking at

         the system.

   </p>

   <p>  Creator: The creator is the person (or people) who created the document. If</p>

   <p>

               the thing is being copied from elsewhere (for example, a pre-existing

    <br />

               document or mail message) then it should be the person who created

           the information in the first place.  When a document is revised,

    <br />

               the person or people who revise it become the creators of a new

           revision of that document.

   </p>

   <p>

      CreationTime: The time at which the thing was created.  Usually this is the

    <br />

                    thing is entered into the system.  If it's being copied from

                elsewhere, try to use the original date that the information

    <br />

                    was created.  When a document is revised, a new revision is

                created, and therefore the creation time is the time of the

    <br />

                    revision.

   </p>

   <p>

    The common fields are always written at the top of a document in a particular way, as shown below.

---

    <br />

    &lt;Tag&gt;(&lt;Revision&gt;)  &lt;status&gt; &lt;type&gt;

    <br />

    &lt;blank line&gt;

    <br />

                              &lt;Upper case title&gt;

                    &lt;Creator&gt;, &lt;Creation date (ISO)&gt;

    <strong>.notes:</strong>

     The Internal Notes field is for notes that will not be published to external clients.

   </p>

   <h2>Tagging</h2>

   <p>Since "doc" is the catch-all type, there is no defined scheme for tagging.  When a document is created because there is no appropriate form in a particular area of the system, use the scheme for the documents around it.  For example, information which supplements a bibliography entry could be tagged "book.gilb93.appendix".  Choose a tag which describes the _thing_ itself, and is therefore a noun.</p>
