# Copyright (c) 2023 Ravenbrook Limited. See end of file for license.
#
# This script finds shell scripts in the MPS tree and runs shellcheck
# on them to check for issues.
#
# It can be invoked from the command line of from Continuous
# Integration scripts.
#
# Usage (in the root directory of the MPS tree)::
#
#    tool/check-shell-scripts
#
# This script excludes some directories from checking:
#
# - It excludes .git because Git installs shell scripts (the default
#   "Git Hooks") that provoke warnings from shellcheck, and we can't
#   fix them.
#
# - It excludes tool/autoconf because those scripts are part of GNU
#   autoconf, provoke warnings from shellcheck, and we can't fix them.
#

find . -path './.git' -prune -o \
     -path './tool/autoconf' -prune -o \
     -type f ! -name '*~' -print |
{
    code=0
    while read -r f; do
	if head -1 -- "$f" | grep -E -q -e '^#!/bin/(ba)?sh'; then
	    # --format=gcc allows use of this script with Emacs M-x compile
	    if ! shellcheck --format=gcc "$f"; then
		code=1
	    fi
