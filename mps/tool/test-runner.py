#How to test a release before shipping it to Configura

#You have a candidate release.  This document tells you how to test it before shipping it -- quick tests.  
#Readership: all.  Confidential: no.  Status: rough notes.  
#Background: knowing the history of MPS development for Configura is an advantage.  
#Peer documents:
#  <http://info.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/master/procedure/release-build/>.
#  <http://info.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/master/procedure/release-configura/>.

#What do we test?
#Not much -- this procedure is for a quick test before shipping, principally to make sure that the build isn't crock in some way.  

#How to run the test:
#You need python (eg. 2.3).  Cd to where you would type w3build.bat.  
#Type ..\tool\test-runner.py
#Each test should report "Conclusion:  Failed to find any defects."
#Also check full log placed in file a1.txt.
