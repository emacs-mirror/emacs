#
# This shell script uses the Travis CI REST API V3 to kick off a build
# on the Travis CI servers.  The build will be run using the Travis CI
# configuration at the commit (in .travis.yml).
#
# See also tool/github-ci-kick.
#
# To get a token for this script, visit
# <https://app.travis-ci.com/account/preferences> and copy your token
# from "API authentication".
#
# TODO: Extend this script to take MPS platform codes and kick off the
# appropriate build, overriding the (possibly nonexistent) Travis Ci
# config.  See [TRAVIS].
#
# TODO: Convert to Python for use from Windows?
#
# TODO: Make -t optional by getting AUTH-TOKEN from somewhere (secure).
