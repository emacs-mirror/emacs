#
# This script finds reStructuredText files in the MPS tree and runs
# them through docutils to check for syntax errors.
#
# It can be invoked from the command line of from Continuous
# Integration scripts.  See .github/workflows/rst-check.yml
#
# This script excludes manual/source because the reStructuredText
# there is in an extended Sphinx format that can't be checked by the
# basic docutils.  It can be checked by building the manual.  See
# manual/Makefile.
