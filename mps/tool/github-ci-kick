#
# This shell script uses the GitHub REST API to kick off a build on
# the GitHub CI servers [GITHUB].  The build will be run using the
# GitHub CI configuration at the commit (in
# .github/workflows/c-cpp.yml).
#
# See also tool/travis-ci-kick.
#
# You can achieve the same thing using the GitHub CLI, if you have
# that installed
# <https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/manually-running-a-workflow#running-a-workflow-using-github-cli>.
# This script is intended to help with automation and so avoids
# depending on that.  [There's a hidden policy implied here.  RB
# 2023-01-15]
#
# To get a token for this script for the Ravenbrook MPS repo at
# GitHub, first see
# <https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token>
# but overlay these details:
#
# 1. In "Resource owner" choose "Ravenbrook".  You must be a member of
#    the GitHub Ravenbrook organisation.
#
# 2. In "Repository access" choose "Only select repositories" and the
#    "Ravenbrook/mps" repository.
#
# 3. In "Permissions" expand "Repository permissions" and under
#    "Actions" choose "Read and write".
#
# NOTE: This script could use the GitHub CLI, but that would require
# it to be installed by the user.
#
# TODO: Convert to Python for use from Windows?
#
# TODO: Make -t optional by getting AUTH-TOKEN from somewhere (secure).
