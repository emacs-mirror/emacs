#
# 1. INTRODUCTION
#
# This shell script pulls Emscripten from GitHub and uses it to build
# the MPS.
#
# Supported platforms: ?.
#
#
# 1.1. PREREQUISITES
#
# clang, curl, git, nodejs
#
# "python" needs to be Python 2 (otherwise configure fails), so you
# may need to run:
#
#     port select --set python python27
# 
# You need to have a program "python2" on your path (which runs Python
# 2.7.3), so on OS X with MacPorts you need to run:
#
#     ln -s /opt/local/bin/python2.7 /opt/local/bin/python2


# 2. CONFIGURATION

# Emscripten git repository
EMSCRIPTEN_REMOTE=https://github.com/kripken/emscripten.git

# Fastcomp git repository
FASTCOMP_REMOTE=https://github.com/kripken/emscripten-fastcomp.git

# Fastcomp clang git repository
CLANG_REMOTE=https://github.com/kripken/emscripten-fastcomp-clang

# Directory to put everything in
TESTDIR="$PWD/.test"
mkdir -p -- "$TESTDIR"
cd -- "$TESTDIR"


# 3. UTILITIES

# 3.1. checkout REPO REMOTE -- clone a git repository and pull

checkout () {
    REPO=$1
    REMOTE=$2
    if [ -d "$REPO" ]; then
        echo "$REPO exists: skipping clone."
    else
        echo "cloning $REMOTE into $REPO."
        git clone --recursive -- "$REMOTE" "$REPO"
    fi
    ( 
        cd -- "$REPO"
        git pull
    )
}


# 4. PROCEDURE

checkout emscripten "$EMSCRIPTEN_REMOTE"


# See [FASTCOMP].
