<p> This wiki article contains incomplete and informal notes about the MPS, the precursor to more formal documentation.  Not confidential.  Readership: MPS users and developers.  </p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This is a temporary collection of addenda (additions and corrections) that should go into the reference manual (RefMan).  It is much better to put corrections straight into the reference manual (if possible), instead of here.</p>

<p>...But sometimes you need to collect information, of which some should go to RefMan and some should go into design docs etc.  You can collect that sort of information here.</p>

<p>...And sometimes it really doesn't seem that all this information should be part of the declared public interface.</p>


<h2>Addenda</h2>

<h3>new parameter "chain" required for <code>mps_class_amc</code>, <code>mps_class_ams</code></h3>

<p>Create a chain with <code>mps_chain_create</code>, and pass it as argument to <code>mps_pool_create</code> for these two pool classes.</p>

<p>Pool class AMS is non-generational, and must have a chain with one element ('generation') specifying a capacity and predicted mortality.  This capacity is not a limit: it is only used to prompt collection of the AMS objects.</p>

<p>Pool class AMC is generational: the chain specifies capacity and predicted mortality of each generation.  These capacities are not limits: they are used for scheduling collection of the AMC objects.</p>

<p>The way chains affect garbage collection is discussed in the <a href="gc_story.html">GC Story</a> article.</p>


<h3>new functions: <code>mps_arena_step</code>, <code>mps_arena_start_collect</code></h3>

<p>When the client has some idle-time, it is permitted to call <code>mps_arena_step(arena, interval, multiplier)</code> to allow MPS to do collection work.  The "interval" argument (units: seconds) specifies how much time the MPS is permitted to take with this mps_arena_step call.  The "multiplier" argument specifies how many further similar calls to mps_arena_step the Client expects to make in this period of idle time.  The idea is that the MPS should return before "interval" is exhausted, and should only eagerly commence long-duration operations that consume CPU (such as a full collection) if those operations are expected to be completed within "multiplier * interval" seconds.</p>

<p>Note that <code>mps_arena_step</code> will still step, even if the arena has been clamped.  This is to allow a client to advance a collection only at these mps_arena_step points (but note that barrier hits will also cause collection work).</p>

<p>The client is permitted to request a full collection with <code>mps_arena_start_collect</code>.  This is an 'asynchronous' request: the MPS returns from this call quickly, usually before the full collection has completed.  (Contrast the <a href="../reference/#mps_arena_collect"><code>mps_arena_collect</code></a> call, which does not return until the full collection has completed).  Work on the full collection then proceeds incrementally, just as it does when the MPS schedules a full collection automatically.</p>

<p>Fuller documentation is currently only in email.  See:</p>

<h3>new class: <code>mps_class_mv</code></h3>

<p>Required header: <code>mpscmv.h</code></p>

<p>Not really new of course, just not documented before.</p>

<p>
The Pool Class MV (Manual Variable) is a manually managed pool that
manages blocks of a variable size.  It is general purpose pool suitable
for malloc/free style management.
</p>

<p>
Pool Class MV supports the <code>mps_alloc/mps_free</code> protocol.
</p>

<p>
Additional arguments to mps_pool_create.  This class takes three extra
arguments each one a <code>size_t</code>: <code>extendBy</code>,
<code>avgSize</code>, <code>maxSize</code>.  extendBy must be smaller than
maxSize.  (aside: this is deliberately vague, partly because the
interface is rubbish)

<h2><a id="section-B" name="section-B">B. Document History</a></h2>

<pre>
  2006-11-28  RHSK  Created: chain for AMC and AMS; mps_arena_step 
                    and mps_arena_start_collect.
  2006-12-29  RHSK  More comments on chain and arena_start/_step.
  2007-04-13  DRJ   mps_class_mv
  2010-02-10  RHSK  Clarify in what way mps_arena_start_collect is 'asynchronous'
</pre>
