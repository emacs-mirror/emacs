<h2><a id="about">3. About the MPS Wiki</a></h2>
  
<p>The MPS Wiki is a wiki in the sense that it is an incomplete, 
  evolving, informally structured collection of articles.</p>
  
<p>Here's a <a href="template.html">template</a> for new articles.</p>

<p>Currently, only MPS developers at Ravenbrook may edit it,  
  but we'd be very grateful for your comments, or articles 
  you would like to contribute:
  please contact us.</p>

<h3>Conventions</h3>

<p>The following symbols are used in wiki articles:</p>
<dl>
  <!--
    <sup><a href="index.html#not-publicly-available" title="this document is not publicly available">&empty;</a></sup>.

  <dt>
    <sup><a id="not-publicly-available" title="this document is not publicly available">&empty;</a></sup>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>marks a link to a document that is not publicly available</p>
    
    <p>Often, this will be a historical document that, along with 
    useful general information, contains some confidential 
    material -- we just haven't had time to publish a 
    'declassified' version.  
    If you suspect this is the case, please 
    request that we do so.</p>

  <!--
    &darr;

  <dt>
    <a id="within-article" title="link within this article">&darr;</a>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>marks a link to another section in the same document</p>
    
    <p>If you intend to read the whole document, you can skip these 
    links and you will not miss out on any material.</p>
