<p> This wiki article contains incomplete and informal notes about the MPS, the precursor to more formal documentation.  Not confidential.  Readership: MPS developers.  </p>

<p>These notes on Allocation Points were written by RHSK between 
  2006-06-12 and 2006-06-23, following research and discussion with 
  RB and NB.</p>

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> this article is more of a technical 
  discussion than a set of facts.  It is not authoritative.
  This is not (yet) an accurate statement of the MPS ap protocol.  
  RHSK 2006-06-23.</p>

<h2><a id="synchronization">Synchronization</a></h2>

<p>The synchronization issues are a little tricky.</p>

<h3>scenario</h3>

<p>The MPS allocation point protocol is a binary protocol.  You don't 
  have to use the mps_reserve and mps_commit macros, but they are 
  conventional and useful pre-packaged implementations.  
  I'm using them as an example of correct protocol, referring to
  <a href="http://www.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/master/code/mps.h">mps.h#17</a>.
  It looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>#define mps_reserve(_p_o, _mps_ap, _size) \
  ((char *)(_mps_ap)-&gt;alloc + (_size) &gt; (char *)(_mps_ap)-&gt;alloc &amp;&amp; \
   (char *)(_mps_ap)-&gt;alloc + (_size) &lt;= (char *)(_mps_ap)-&gt;limit ? \
     ((_mps_ap)-&gt;alloc = \
       (mps_addr_t)((char *)(_mps_ap)-&gt;alloc + (_size)), \
      *(_p_o) = (_mps_ap)-&gt;init, \
      MPS_RES_OK) : \
     mps_ap_fill(_p_o, _mps_ap, _size))

#define mps_commit(_mps_ap, _p, _size) \
  ((_mps_ap)-&gt;init = (_mps_ap)-&gt;alloc, \
   (_mps_ap)-&gt;limit != 0 || mps_ap_trip(_mps_ap, _p, _size))
</code></pre>

<p>Abstractly, the mutator code has a cycle of four operations on the 
  allocation point:</p>
<dl>
  <dt> Lr </dt>
  <dd> read Limit at reserve </dd>
  
  <dt> A </dt>
  <dd> write Alloc at reserve </dd>
  
  <dt> I </dt>
  <dd> write Init at commit </dd>
  
  <dt> Lc </dt>
  <dd> read Limit at commit </dd>
</dl>

<p>The normal cycle is Lr A I Lc.</p>

<p>After Lr, the mutator checks that A + size &lt;= Lr.  If this fails, 
  then the mutator does mps_ap_fill instead of A.  So Lr mps_ap_fill I Lc 
  is also a valid cycle.</p>

<p>After Lc, the mutator checks that Lc != 0.  If this fails, the 
  mutator will call mps_ap_trip before beginning a new cycle.  So 
  Lr A I Lc mps_ap_trip is also a valid cycle.</p>

<p>The mutator cannot interrupt the 
  collector.</p>

<p>The collector can interrupt the mutator (between any 
  two mutator instructions).  The collector can only see the A, I, 
  and mps_ap_trip (if present) operations; Lr and Lc are invisible 
  to it.</p>

<p>If the ap is not going to trip, the collector sees two 
  equivalence classes:</p>
<ul>
  <li> (A)</li>
  <li> (I Lc Lr)</li>
</ul>

<p>If the ap is going to trip, the collector sees four
  equivalence classes:</p>
<ul>
  <li> (A)</li>
  <li> (I Lc)</li>
  <li> (the call to mps_ap_trip)</li>
  <li> (mps_ap_trip Lr)</li>
</ul>

<p>The collector has two responsibilities:</p>
<dl>
  <dt> FIX </dt> 
  <dd> to fix (or not fix) references TO the object;</dd>
  <dt> SCAN </dt>
  <dd> to scan (or not scan) references IN the object.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>A mutator with ambiguous references only (to the new object)</h3>

<p>Let's see what's required for a mutator that promises to make no 
  exact references to the new object until Lc succeeds, 
  and promises to have at least one ambiguous reference to the 
  new object when it sets I.</p>
  
<p>Consider a flip -- f1 -- in state A.</p>

<p>The collector at f1 sees (A), and recognises that the I..A region 
  is unmanaged memory.  
  The object is never going to be valid, 
  because it may contain stale references from before the flip, and the 
  collector can't fix them.</p>

<p>The f1 collector writes L = 0, tripping the allocation 
  point, and the rest of this collection is easy.  
  The FIX responsibility is easy: 
  all references to the new object are ambiguous, so the 
  collector can fix them or not -- it 
  doesn't matter.  
  For SCAN, the collector must not scan the new object 
  (because it is not yet formatted), so 
  it must not scan the buffered pool beyond I.</p>

<p>Further collections at this point are idempotent.</p>

<p>Now, suppose the mutator then restarts, but only gets as far 
  as (I Lc) before we have a second collection and a 
  second flip -- f2.</p>

<p>For FIX, f2 can fix or not -- it still doesn't matter.</p>

<p>But for SCAN, f2 <strong>MUST NOT</strong> scan the new object.
  Why not?</p>

<p>The mutator's format code will be okay: the fact 
  that I is set tells f2 that the object 
  is fully formatted.</p>

<p>But there is a problem: the object may contain stale exact 
  references -- unfixed references from before f1.  
  These stale exact references will be bogus.  
  Opinions differ on the implications of bogus exact references.  
  See the next section for a discussion.</p>

<p>Additionally, the collector is not <em>obliged</em> to scan the 
  object: this object is dead!  
  The mutator will later notice that Lr == 0 and realise the object 
  is invalid.  The mutator is not relying 
  on this object to keep anything else alive.</p>

<p>It is easy to avoid scanning the invalid object: 
  the first flip in state (A), f1, must record the value of I.  
  Call the recorded pointer If1.  
  Collections must not scan beyond If1.  
  If1 remains set until the mutator calls mps_ap_trip, 
  which resets If1 to 0.
  [Note: I have not checked whether the MPS 
  records and uses If1 -- RHSK 2006-06-12]</p>

<h3>How bad is a bogus exact reference?</h3>

<p>Tucker said:</p>
<blockquote><p>I believe the collector must be prepared to deal 
  with exact dangling pointers anyways, so this complex 
  mechanism is unnecessary.  
  [<a href="/project/mps/mail/1997/05/12/12-46/1.txt">//info.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/mail/1997/05/12/12-46/1.txt:X-MMInfo-Tag: mail.ptw.1997-05-12.12-46(1)</a>]
</p></blockquote>

<p>I'm not convinced.</p>

<p>Fixing a bogus exact reference is bad news.  
  The worst case is spoofing:
  Imagine the bogus exact reference points at part of a 
  JPEG that <em>just happens</em> to look like a validly formatted 
  object.  
  If this JPEG is in the middle of an object in a moving MPS 
  pool, fixing the bogus exact reference will overwrite a portion 
  of the JPEG with a forwarding object.  
  It gets worse: the spoof object is preserved and will later be 
  scanned, producing more bogus exact references!
  For "JPEG", you can substitute "encrypted string".</p>

<p>The only safe way to cope with such a bogus reference is for 
   Fix to verify that the reference points to the start of a real 
   object, which it could do by iterating the format skip method 
   from some known point in the pool.</p>

<p>The consequences of fixing a bogus exact 
  reference may be:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Referent is not in MPS memory:
    <ul>
      <li> MPS must detect and ignore these; there should be a 
           debug option to report it;</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> Referent is not validly formatted:
    <ul>
      <li> mutator format code crashes; or</li>
      <li> mutator format code does something stupid or 
           illegal, and causes corruption or makes MPS crash; or</li>
      <li> (if we're lucky) mutator format code detects this 
           and avoids any harmful action.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> Referent appears validly formatted, but is a spoof 
       (that is, it is actually data inside some other 
       object):
    <ul>
      <li> in a moving pool: the object is silently corrupted 
           with a forwarding pointer, and the spoof object is 
           preserved and will later be scanned, producing more 
           bogus exact references!</li>
      <li> in a non-moving pool: object is safe from corruption, 
           but MPS greying/blackening code needs to be robust to 
           this case.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> Referent is a validly formatted but dead object:
    <ul>
      <li>it gets needlessly preserved;</li>
      <li>if it had been dead for some time, this dead object may 
          itself contain bogus exact references, and these will get 
          'fixed' too.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>  

<p>Also, more arcanely, I wonder whether there's a problem if the 
  referent violates the tri-colour invariant (when scanning at 
  black)?  Does the MPS care about this, or does it 'safely' just 
  cause more conservatism?  Does MPS detect and flag this in 
  debug versions?  Could it?</p>

<p>If MPS or format code detects a bogus exact reference, it could 
  assert, and/or to fix them to a canonical special value.</p>

<p>Some possible contracts between mutator and collector:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Mutator and collector promise never to have bogus exact 
    references.  The collector is permitted to crash if it 
    encounters one.</li>
  <li>Mutator agrees that bogus exact references are wrong.  
    But mutator would like a helpful error message, please.  
    (Collector is not permitted to crash).</li>
  <li>Mutator wants permission to keep bogus exact references 
    in certain circumstances, such as on the stack.  Collector 
    must cope safely.  Need to specify how this is guaranteed, 
    based on intimate knowledge of the mutator's behaviour.  
    Dodgy.</li>
  <li>Mutator wants permission to keep bogus exact references 
    in general.  Collector must safely cope with all the cases 
    of bogus exact references listed above.  I believe the MPS 
    does not currently do this.  It would require a very fast 
    check at fix time that the reference is to the start of a 
    valid object in an MPS client pool.</li>
</ol>

<h3>with exact refs</h3>

<p>For an all-exact mode of use, mutator must make an exact pointer 
before setting I=A, and must keep it at least until it after 
it has read Lc to see whether the commit succeeded.</p>

<p>So, some additions to the AP User's Guide, in the section on mps_reserve:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Secondly, "raw data" means that any references TO the new 
  object are treated like other references to unmanaged memory.
      [.belief.refs-to-uninit-safe:
       We're 'sure', but I need to check this.  What does Fix 
       actually do with a pointer into the init-alloc zone?  We
       hope it ignores it.  RHSK 2006-06-09]
  Because of this, you are permitted to connect the new object 
  into your graph of managed objects immediately.  The MPS gives 
  you these guarantees:</p>
<ul>
  <li> the new object is pinned (won't move), so references to it 
    that you write in old objects won't become stale at this time 
    (but see <code>mps_commit</code> below!)</li>
  <li> although the new object is 'reachable' by these references,
    at this stage (while I &lt; A) the MPS knows it 
    is not yet managed, and will not try to preserve it;</li>
  <li> the MPS will not call the client's format code to answer 
    questions about the new object.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>And to the section on mps_commit:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>When this happens the client should take care to clear up any 
    managed references to the (now vanished) new object.</p>
  
  <p>[But there's a hole here, before the client does this.  
      Are managed (aka scanned) references TO 
      it still safe?  They were safe during building 
      (by .belief.refs-to-uninit-safe).  But now the AP pointers have 
      gone away.  Are they still safe?  
      Clearly, if they are only RankAMBIG, they are safe.  
      What if they are RankEXACT?
      RHSK 2006-06-09]</p>
    
  <p>[Discussion with RB 2006-06-09: yes, that's a problem for exact 
      references.  Must not make any exact refs to a new object.  And 
      unmanaged refs are not sufficient, because they won't preserve the 
      new object during commit.  So must make at least one ambiguous 
      ref to new object before calling commit.  That's the truth 
      currently.  There are various ways to solve this to allow 
      purely-exact mutators.  For instance, 
      keep the old init..alloc address-space flagged as a zombie zone, 
      until some communication with mutator (perhaps another reserve 
      from same AP?) indicates that mutator has removed all those 
      pesky exact refs to the now-dead ex-new object.  RHSK 2006-06-09]</p>
</blockquote>  

<p>See <a href="unmanaged.html">issues with unmanaged workspace</a> for 
  a discussion of the "abort" phase, which we need to define 
  for allocation points.</p>

<p>The MPS needs to keep the buffer mapped for some time -- 
  until the mutator has stopped writing into it.
  The MPS needs to remember If1 forever.  
  The MPS needs to remember the rest of the 
  about-to-be-detached buffer structure for some time -- 
  when is the MPS permitted to detach the buffer?</p>

<p>Keeping the buffer mapped consumes resource.  
  There must be a contract with the mutator about when the 
  MPS is permitted to free it.  
</p>

<p>We could define the protocol such that there is a window: 
  after the mutator discovers that it has lost the race, but 
  while the collector is still remembering that this object 
  is invalid.  The mutator could use this window to null-out 
  exact references to the new object.</p>

<p>This window could be after Lc and before calling mps_ap_trip.  
  During this time, 
  the collector must keep the new object as pinned unmanaged 
  memory.  By calling mps_ap_trip, the mutator promises that 
  it has nulled-out any exact references to the new object, 
  and the collector in mps_ap_trip may unmap the memory or 
  safely re-use it without fear of spoofing.</p>
  
<p>Or, we could leave the window open until mps_ap_fill is 
  called.  We just need to define it.</p>

<h3>flipping at other times</h3>

<p>Perhaps the collector wants to flip even when the ap is not 
  at (A).  Need to analyse synchronization issues here.</p>
