<p>Notes on getting started with GC -- Garbage Collection.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<h3>The essential MPS concepts for GC are:</h3>
<dl>
  <dt> <a href="#Format">Format&darr;</a></dt>
  <dd> lets the MPS ask the client a question about an object;</dd>

  <dt> <a href="#Root">Root&darr;</a></dt>
  <dd> tell the MPS which things (eg. stack, globals) are always alive.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>The advanced MPS concepts for GC are:</h3>
<dl>
  <dt> Allocation Point
       (see <a href="apguide.html">user's guide</a>)</dt>
  <dd> reserve memory, build a new object, and commit 
       it to MPS management.
  </dd>
  
  <dt> <a href="#Protection">Protection and incremental collection&darr;</a></dt>
  <dd> MPS sets operating-system read- or write-barriers on certain 
    pages.  When client tries to use this protected memory, the MPS 
    interrupts and does just enough garbage-collection to allow the 
    client to see this page.
  </dd>
</dl>


<h2><a id="Format">Format</a></h2>

<p>The client can choose how to format its objects, but the MPS will
sometimes need to ask the client some questions about an object, such
as:</p>
<ul>
  <li> how big is it? (so that if it is dead the MPS collects only that
       object)</li>
  <li> what pointers does it contain? (so the MPS can mark referred-to
       objects as still alive)</li>
</ul>

<p>For each type of question, the client must provide a function that gives
the answer.  These functions are called "format methods", and are
collected together into a "format"
(mps_fmt_t).  Usually the client developer writes these functions,
calls "<code>mps_fmt_create_...</code>" to
collect them into a format, and passes this format to the MPS as an
argument to <code>mps_pool_create()</code>.</p>

<p>A client's format code is 'special'.  It is called at special times (eg.
when handling an interrupt), and is quite restricted in what it is
allowed to do.  Format code is often on the critical path for memory
management operations.  The full requirement for a format is
complicated; see documentation in the Reference Manual.  But
here's a simplified overview:</p>

<p>No format is required for an object in a non-scanned, non-collectable
pool -- the MPS never needs to know the internal details of objects in
these pools.</p>

<p>For collectable and/or scannable pools, the client's format code
generally needs to support three types of object:</p>
<ol>
  <li> the client's own initialized objects;</li>
  <li> on behalf of the MPS, a "forwarding object";</li>
  <li> on behalf of the MPS, a "padding object".</li>
</ol>

<p>A forwarding object is a placeholder that the MPS uses when it has moved
the object that used to be there.  ('Normal' client code never sees
these forwarding objects; only client format code does).</p>

<p>A padding object is a 'dummy' object that the MPS uses when there is not
enough room (eg. at the end of a memory page) to put a real client
object.</p>

<p>The client must be able to distinguish between these three types 
of object.  To guarantee this, client code MUST initialize
memory obtained from the MPS (by mps_alloc or mps_reserve) BEFORE it
makes any other call into the MPS from that thread (including the call to
mps_commit).  Here, "initialize" means at least enough initialization
that the client's format code handles the object correctly, including
whether it is a client object, a forwarding object, or a padding object.
[See also protocol.mps.format.rel.ap.  RHSK 2006-06-02]</p>

<h3><a id="format-methods">The most important format methods are:</a></h3>

<p>Indicate the size of a collectable client object:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Skip (see <a href="../reference/index.html#mps_fmt_skip_t">mps_fmt_skip_t</a>):
         client must tell the MPS how big this object is.</li>
</ul>

<p>List all references from this object to (other) collectable objects:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Scan (see <a href="../reference/index.html#mps_fmt_scan_t">mps_fmt_scan_t</a>): 
         client must 'scan' the object for pointers, and tell 
         the MPS to 'fix' each pointer it finds;</li>
</ul>

<p>Move this client object (obsolete, see below):</p>
<ul>
  <li> Copy (obsolete) (see <a href="../reference/index.html#mps_fmt_copy_t">mps_fmt_copy_t</a>):
         client must copy the object to a new location.</li>
</ul>

<p>Create/use a forwarding object (used by an incremental moving pool after moving a client object):</p>
<ul>
  <li> Fwd (see <a href="../reference/index.html#mps_fmt_fwd_t">mps_fmt_fwd_t</a>):
         client must create a forwarding object here, and store
         the supplied forwarding pointer in it;</li>
  <li> IsFwd (see <a href="../reference/index.html#mps_fmt_isfwd_t">mps_fmt_isfwd_t</a>):
         client must test whether this is a forwarding object
         (created by the Fwd method), and if so return the 
         forwarding pointer stored in it.  (This is how the 
         MPS remembers where a moved object was moved to).</li>
</ul>

<p>Create a padding object:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Pad (see <a href="../reference/index.html#mps_fmt_pad_t">mps_fmt_pad_t</a>):
         create a padding object here, please.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a id="format-methods-copy-is-obsolete">Format Methods: the Copy method is obsolete</a></h3>

<p>The Copy method is obsolete, and is never called.  The MPS just uses 
<code>mps_lib_memcpy()</code> to copy the bytes to the new location.  
It knows how many bytes to copy by using the Skip method.</p>

<p>Historical notes: The original justification for Copy was:</p>
<ul>
  <li> client (knowing the object's data fields) might intelligently 
         copy less than all the bytes;</li>
  <li> client might alter the data, eg. fixing-up internal pointers.</li>
</ul>
<p>... but this didn't happen with actual clients, and the interface 
to the copy method didn't pass the skip-size (which the MPS has 
already determined by calling Skip) and so didn't allow an efficient 
copy method to be written. So it was dropped, in 1998 or earlier.  
The only place this memcpy currently occurs is in poolamc.c,  in 
AMCFix() (and now AMCHeaderFix() too).</p>

<p>There are notes on this change at 
<a href="../../design/trace/#fix.nocopy">design/trace/#fix.nocopy</a>.</p>

<h3><a id="format-variants">Format Variants</a></h3>

<p>There are several different ways to package-up the format methods -- these different ways are called 'variants'.  MPS currently supports four format variants.  The creation functions for these are:</p>
<ul>
  <li> <a href="../reference/index.html#mps_fmt_create_A">mps_fmt_create_A</a>;</li>
  <li> <a href="../reference/index.html#mps_fmt_create_B">mps_fmt_create_B</a>;</li>
  <li> <a href="../reference/index.html#mps_fmt_create_auto_header">mps_fmt_create_auto_header</a>;</li>
  <li> <a href="../reference/index.html#mps_fmt_create_fixed">mps_fmt_create_fixed</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>It's a bit messy -- sorry.</p>

<h2><a id="Root">Roots</a></h2>

<pre>
<a href="/project/mps/import/2001-09-27/mminfo/doc/impl/h/mps/index.txt#1">//info.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/import/2001-09-27/mminfo/doc/impl/h/mps/index.txt#1</a>
   307 /* Root Creation and Destruction
   308  *
   309  * mps_root_create creates the most general type of root: a scanning
   310  * function with two closure elements, p and s.
   311  *
   312  * mps_root_create_table creates a root from a block of memory which
   313  * contains a contiguous array of references.  Pages containing table
   314  * roots may be protected by the MPS if MPS_RM_PROT is set in the
   315  * root mode.
   316  *
   317  * mps_root_create_fmt creates a root from a block of memory which
   318  * contains formatted objects.  Pages containing fmt roots may be
   319  * protected by the MPS if MPS_RM_PROT is set in the root mode.
   320  *
   321  * mps_root_create_reg creates a root which will be used to scan
   322  * the registers of a thread.  (Often it will scan the stack, too.)
   323  */
</pre>

<p>You must designate the permanent root-points of your object graph 
  as an MPS root, for example with one or more calls to 
  mps_root_create_table.  
  All your MPS objects (in collectable pools) must be reachable 
  from these permanent roots, to prevent them from getting 
  collected.</p>

<p>Usually, you also use mps_root_create_reg to designate your local 
  variables (stack and registers) as an ambiguous root.  
  This ensures the objects you are working on are preserved 
  even if you temporarily remove them from the graph reachable from 
  your permanent roots.  Because this is an ambiguous root, it also 
  pins the objects you are working on.</p>
  

<h2><a id="Protection">Protection and incremental collection</a></h2>

<p>These notes on Protection and incremental collection were written 
  by RHSK between 2006-06-15 and 2006-06-15, following research and 
  discussion with RB and DRJ.</p>

<p>The MPS can set operating-system read- or write-barriers on certain 
    pages.  When client tries to use this protected memory, the MPS 
    interrupts and does just enough garbage-collection to allow the 
    client to see this page.</p>

<p>On Windows, currently, these barriers are implemented using SEH -- Structured Exception Handling.</p>

<blockquote>
<p> Some advanced, incomplete notes on protection and foreign function 
  calls:</p>
<pre><a href="http://info.ravenbrook.com/mail/2006/05/17/11-03-54/0.txt">//info.ravenbrook.com/mail/2006/05/17/11-03-54/0.txt</a>
"chat with DRJ RB RHSK about work for Configura, and other MPS issues"
...
MPS should be part of runtime for a language.
One necessary part is SEH:
   - required once per thread;
   - AND required on foreign function calls inward.
Otherwise,
   1. some foreign C++ might steal our exception;
   2. this might be a thread we've never seen before
(In fact, client need to have a bit standard of code that works out  
if the MPS has seen this thread before.  It must call this code on  
every inbound call from foreign code.)  DRJ: "Dylan does this".
There's a bunch of assumes about compiled code, ABI etc, play nice  
with sighandler etc.
Might be poss for GR to generate code that doesn't use SEH if he  
wasn't using MPS.

MPS has a requirement that you use this extremely poorly documented  
SEH interface.
2 improvements:
   1. better documentation for this
   2. try to make the MPS *not* require SEH
