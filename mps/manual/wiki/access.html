<p> This wiki article contains incomplete and informal notes about the MPS, the precursor to more formal documentation.  Not confidential.  Readership: MPS users and developers.  </p>


<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>There are three times that the MPS must be informed of mutator access to memory:</p>
<ul>
  <li> grey-mutator writes to black segment (during incremental GC); </li>
  <li> black-mutator reads from grey segment (during incremental GC); </li>
  <li> mutator writes to seg with a summary. </li>
</ul>

<p>( Some additional notes on why the MPS needs to know about these accesses: </p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Incremental GC</strong>: During an incremental garbage collection trace, the mutator (client) code runs, and may access and change ("mutate") the object graph, while the MPS is still working on GC'ing it.  The mutator must not be able to see or change* parts of the object graph on the other side of the flip, so the MPS protects these parts with a barrier.  When the mutator hits such a barrier, this is called an <strong>access</strong>.</p>

<p class="note">(* "see or change": Currently, the MPS only uses black-mutator tracing: the mutator must not see past the flip, so the MPS sets a read barrier on grey objects.  For grey-mutator tracing (not fully implemented): the mutator must not change objects past the flip, so the MPS would set a write barrier on black objects.)</p>

<p><strong>Summaries</strong>: The MPS maintains summaries of which zones are referenced by the objects on each segment.  If the mutator changes parts of such a segment, the summary may no longer be correct, so the MPS protects summarised segments (those with a non-trivial summary) with a write-barrier.  When the mutator hits such a barrier, this is called an <strong>access</strong>, also.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>)</p>

<p>By setting operating system memory barriers, the MPS intercepts these types of mutator access.</p>

<p>Once intercepted, the MPS may do some preparatory processing, but it <em>must</em> then perform the access that the mutator intended.  There are two ways to do this:</p>

<ul>
  <li> (after the preparatory processing) <strong>remove</strong> the memory barrier, and restart the mutator at the instruction that caused the access -- which will then succeed as normal without hitting any barrier; </li>
  <li> (after the preparatory processing) <strong>emulate</strong> the mutator instruction that caused the access, do some post-processing (if required), leave the memory barrier in place, and restart the mutator at the instruction <em>after</em> the one that caused the access.</li>
</ul>

<p>The MPS must choose which approach to use for each access.  As often happens, there is a space/time tradeoff -- see "choosing approach" below.  To summarise the choice in brief:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Removing the barrier is always possible, but may require up to a whole segment of references to be scanned too early -- that is, band-promoted -- and may therefore cause object retention and delayed finalization.</li>
  <li> Emulation allows the MPS to band-promote only the single accessed reference, and thus causes less retention.  However, it is not always possible (not all instructions can be emulated), and may take more time because it leaves the barrier in place, which may cause the mutator to hit the barrier repeatedly.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Which Barriers Were Hit?</h2>


<p>Oh, if only it were so simple.  The MPS Shield abstractly assumes that read barrier and write barrier are independent controllable, and that the MPS can tell precisely which one was hit.  Abstractly, we'd like to know the following quantity:</p>

<blockquote><pre><code>AccessSet wereHit;  /* which barriers were hit */</code></pre></blockquote>

<p>This is too simplistic!  Because, alas, operating systems are not so flexible:</p>
<ul>
  <li> most OSs don't allow setting write barrier but no read barrier; </li>
  <li> some OSs don't tell the signal-handler whether the faulting instruction tried to read, write, or both. </li>
</ul>

<p>So the MPS has to try to reconstruct, as fully as it can, information about which barrier was hit.</p>

<p>Currently, this reconstruction is done in a rather ad hoc way.  Currently, the platform-part is not allowed to see SM* and PM*, so it calculates a (very conservative) "<code>platformThinksMayHaveBeenHit</code>" value without this information, and passes it in the "mode" parameter of its call to ArenaAccess().  Then the platform-independent ArenaAccess and friends, which can see SM/PM, do further reconstruction.</p>

<p><em>(*: SM (ShieldMode) states which barriers are supposed to be seen by the mutator. PM (ProtectionMode) states how the MPS would like the OS barriers to be set right now. When the MPS is accessing memory, PM may be lower than SM.)</em></p>

<p>I do not like this approach.  I think the reconstruction would best be calculated by the platform-part of the MPS barrier code (prot*.c), using whatever data the OS passes to the signal-handler, <strong>plus</strong> the SM and PM values for this segment.</p>

<p class="note"><em class="note">[Also, threads may cause nasty synchronisation issues: SM and PM do not change atomically with changes to the OS barriers, so threads may cause a barrier hit when the barriers and SM &amp; PM are not consistent.  If all MPS access to mutator memory (such as during collection work) only happens when all threads are stopped, then this doesn't happen yet.  Nonetheless, the MPS logic that does this reconstruction should be better isolated, clearer, and safer, IMHO.  It could be moved into the platform-part without performance or modularity cost: the platform-part can have several static tables from SM/PM -> wereHit, select the appropriate one depending on the data the OS passes to the signal-handler for this hit, and pass a pointer to it in the call to ArenaAccess() (in a new parameter).  RHSK 2007-09-30]</em></p>

<p>When reconstructing which barriers were hit, for each faulting instruction, the following two properties are important:</p>
<ul>
  <li> .mustGetLowered: which barriers -- expressed as an MPS Shield AccessSet -- must the MPS necessarily ask to be lowered in order to permit this instruction to succeed? </li>
  <li> .willBeAccessed: will this mutator instruction <em>actually</em> read, write, or both read and write the cell on this segment? </li>
</ul>

<p>Note that the "<code>willBeAccessed</code>" value must be the same or smaller than the "<code>mustGetLowered</code>" value (or our implementation of barriers is broken).</p>


<h3>For the "remove barrier" approach</h3>

<p>If the MPS chooses the "remove barrier" approach, it must calculate a conservatively-accurate "<code>mustGetLowered</code>" value, which, when lowered, will remove all the barriers that <strong>may</strong> have been hit by the faulting instruction.  The MPS will lower these barriers and restart the mutator on the instruction that originally caused the fault.  If "<code>mustGetLowered</code>" does not cause all necessary OS barriers to be lowered, the instruction will hit the barrier again, and we are stuck in an infinite loop.</p>

<p>Because it is about to lower these barriers, the MPS must do the corresponding preparatory processing (greyening, scanning, and summary-zapping) for the whole segment.</p>

<p>(The "<code>willBeAccessed</code>" value is not important with this approach.  It must be the same or smaller than the "<code>mustGetLowered</code>" value anyway.)</p>


<h3>For the "emulate" approach</h3>

<p>If the MPS chooses the "emulate" approach, we don't care about the "<code>mustGetLowered</code>" value, because we will not be lowering any barriers, and we will not be restarting the faulting instruction.</p>

<p>But we <em>do</em> need to know the "<code>willBeAccessed</code>" value (that is: whether the emulated instruction will read, write, or both), and we must do the corresponding preparatory processing (greyening, scanning, and summary-zapping) for the affected reference.</p>


<h2>Which Barriers Shall We Lower?</h2>

<p>If both barriers are up, then -- even if mustGetLowered is small -- the MPS might <strong>choose</strong> to lower <strong>both</strong> barriers anyway, to improve performance.  If the mutator is going to hit the other barrier in one or two instructions time anyway then we may as well lower it now, and avoid paying for two barrier hits.  Not a big point, but worth mentioning.</p>


<h2>Which Approach Shall We Take?</h2>

<p>The factors in choosing between the "remove" and "emulate" approaches are:</p>
<ul>
  <li> what is the cost of having to remove barriers from the whole seg?; </li>
</ul>


<h2>Incrementality Read-Barrier Hit</h2>

<p>This happens:</p>

<blockquote><pre><code>sigHandle (prot*.c)
 ArenaAccess
  PoolAccess (pool.c)
   (pool->class->access)</code></pre></blockquote>

<p>For AWL, AWLAccess() ... </p>
