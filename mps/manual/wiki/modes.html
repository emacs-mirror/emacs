<p> This wiki article contains incomplete and informal notes about the MPS, the precursor to more formal documentation.  Not confidential.  Readership: MPS users and developers.  </p>

<p><strong>Warning: this document is young, and does not represent consensus.</strong>  RHSK 2006-06-16.</p>


<h2>Recommended modes of use of MPS:</h2>

<p>The recommended modes of use, currently, are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>.manual.mps-friendly</li>
  <li>.ambiguous-workspace</li>
</ul>


<h2>Potential modes of use of MPS:</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>.manual:</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>= no collection</p>
    <dl>
      <dt>.manual.malloc:</dt>
      <dd>pure malloc/free replacement</dd>

      <dt>.manual.mps-friendly:</dt>
      <dd>an MPS-friendly interface: ap, SAC, etc</dd>

      <dt>.manual.c++:</dt>
      <dd>C++ friendly (not sure what this involves)</dd>

      <dt>.manual.stl:</dt>
      <dd>packaged as allocator for a C++ STL (Standard Template 
        Library) allocator</dd>
    </dl>
  </dd>
  
  <dt>.freeless:</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>= malloc, with free a no-op</p>
    <p>Probably formatless and fully ambig (Boehm-like).</p>
  </dd>
  
  <dt>.attachable:</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>(for .manual and .freeless) attach without source code changes, 
      or without a re-compile, or without a re-link, 
      or even without stopping mutator?</p>
  </dd>
  
  <dt><a id="unmanaged-workspace">.unmanaged-workspace:</a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>= workspace (eg. registers and stack) is not scanned</p>
    
    <p>This should be the simplest, but surprisingly it 
      doesn't seem to be well defined -- the MPS seems to lack 
      the necessary protocols for it!</p>
    
    <p>(The only current protocol for unmanaged objects 
      is when they are under construction in allocation points).</p>
    
    <p>For further discussion, see
      <a href="unmanaged.html">issues with unmanaged workspace</a>.</p>
    
    <p>The simplest starting point would probably be:
      formatted, exact, non-incremental, and single-threaded.
      (No protection, no stack or register scanner).  
      This is fine for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li> adding GC to part of bigger application;</li>
      <li> implementing a simple language in C.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>This is what the SC integration wants.</p>
      
    <p>Even when we define the necessary protocols, we're not 
      sure what the limits will be.  Multi-threaded might 
      be very hard.</p>
  </dd>
  
  <dt>.ambiguous-workspace:</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>= all workspace (eg. registers and stack)
      is scanned ambiguously, 
      with the exception of objects under construction 
      in allocation points, which are unmanaged but guarded.</p>
    <p>This is our Dylan-like bread and butter:
      incremental, generational, mostly copying, 
      formatted, ambiguous reg+stack, 
      supports foreign code, multi-threaded.  
      And we do location-dependency, weakness, finalization, ...</p>
  </dd>
  
  <dt>.exact-workspace:</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>= all workspace (eg. registers and stack)
      is scanned exactly
      (except objects under construction in allocation points)</p>
    <p>Might be useful for someone writing their own compiler.  
      You wouldn't want to write this code in C.</p>

<pre>
  2006-06-15  RHSK  Created.
  2006-06-15  RHSK  Modes of use; Types of object; Types of reference.
  2006-06-16  RHSK  Objects, cells, and references; Using unmanaged workspace
  2006-06-20  RHSK  Tidy and clarify.  False aborts in guarded protocols.
  2006-06-21  RHSK  Move unmanaged workspace discussion to its own article.
  2006-06-22  RHSK  Separate recommended and potential modes of use.
