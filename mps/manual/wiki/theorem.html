<p> This wiki article contains incomplete and informal notes about the MPS, the precursor to more formal documentation.  Not confidential.  Readership: MPS users and developers.  </p>

<p> This article is a place in which to collect statements about the MPS that are, or perhaps should be, true, and then chew on to decide whether they are on not.  RHSK 2007-03-01. </p>


<h2>Theorems about the MPS</h2>


<h3> isFwd only on client objects </h3>

<p> A format isFwd() method is only called on objects allocated by the client, or copies of them created by the MPS.  So in particular: never on pad objects, and never on random junk.  DRJ 2007-03-01. </p>


<h3> starting a collection (trace) causes no allocation </h3>

<p> "it's always possible to start a trace (provided there's a free TraceId) even if there's no available memory", says trace.c#32.  RHSK 2008-11-26. </p>
