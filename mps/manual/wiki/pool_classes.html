<p> This wiki article contains incomplete and informal notes about the MPS, the precursor to more formal documentation.  Not confidential.  Readership: MPS users and developers.  </p>

<h2>How to choose the right MPS pool class</h2>

<p>We would like a 'map' from a client's requirements to the 
  recommended pool class:</p>
<blockquote><pre>
Do you need garbage collection?
Do you have objects with no references in them?
Do you need to pass buffers to system calls?
etc etc
You need mps_class_lo.
</pre></blockquote>
  
<p> For now, the closest we have to this is a survey from 1998 that 
  still contains confidential material:
  <a href="/project/mps/doc/2002-06-18/obsolete-mminfo/mmdoc/doc/mps/guide/pool-classes/">guide.mps.pool-classes by RIT</a>

<h2>Some notes about MPS pool classes</h2>

<dl>
  <dt>mps_class_amc</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>General-purpose automatic (collecting) pool class.
      This is the most 'advanced' pool class in the MPS, intended 
      for most client objects.</p>
    <p>AMC is "Automatic, Mostly Copying": it uses copying collection 
      except when prevented by ambiguous references.  It is 
      generational.</p>
    <p>Chain: specify capacity and mortality of generations 0..N-1.  
      Survivors from N-1 get promoted into an arena-wide topGen 
      (often anachronistically called the "dynamic" generation).</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>mps_class_amcz</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>General-purpose leaf-only pool class (for objects that contain no references).
      A variant of AMC (the Z means "Zero rank", ie. containing no references).</p>
  </dd>

  <dt>mps_class_ams</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Non-moving automatic (collecting) pool class.</p>
    <p>AMS is "Automatic Mark &amp; Sweep".  Not generational.</p>
    <p>Chain: specify capacity and mortality of 'generation' 0.  
      [Why?  Perhaps to trigger nursery-like collections?
      New 2001-03-02. RHSK 2006-11-27]</p>
  </dd>

  <dt><a id="mps_class_lo">mps_class_lo</a></dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Non-moving, non-protecting, automatic (collecting), 
      Leaf Only pool class (for objects that contain no references).
      Unit test: locv.c.  RefMan: -undocumented-.</p>
    <p>This pool class should really be called "flat data 
      that needs to be accessed by 
      <a href="glossary.html#foreign_code">foreign code</a>"
       -- it's ideal for allocating a buffer to pass to an 
       operating system I/O call.  It is not very fast.
       [Conversation with DRJ, 2006-07].</p>
    <p>(For a general-purpose leaf-only pool see AMCZ).</p>

  <dt id="mps_class_awl">mps_class_awl</dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Automatic Weak Linked</p>

    <p>For weak references, linked to normal references.  The purpose of
    this pool class is to allow the client to implement hash tables (or,
    conceivably some similar datastructures) that are partly or wholly
    weak.  A client might want a weak-key strong-value table, or a
    strong-key weak-value table (or in fact weak-key weak-value).  For
    example, Java's <a
    href"http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/util/WeakHashMap.html">java.util.WeakHashMap</a>
    class.
    </p>

    <p>
    The principle idea behind a weak-key strong-value hash table is that
    the keys are weakly referenced, so their presence in the table will
    not prevent the key object from being garbage collected.  Once the
    key is no longer reachable, weak references to it may get splatted.
    Obviously once that has happened you can't get at the value
    corresponding to the key anymore, so the implementation is free to
    splat the value slot as well.</p>

    <p>
    Pool Class AWL allows the implementation to splat the value slot at
    the same time that the (weak) key slot is splatted.  (Or the other
    way around if you have strong-key weak-value tables).
    </p>

    <p>
    Exactly <em>how</em> you do this is not yet well documented (but see
    below for more hints).
    </p>

    <p>
    AWL has another special power: it enables better handing of barrier
    hits on weak objects.  To explain the benefit we need to describe a
    problem first.  The MPS uses a read-barrier to perform incremental
    garbage collection [@@ link to canned-for-client explanation of how
    a garbage collector works in broad terms].  When the client tries to
    read an object containing weak references the MPS may have protected
    it so that the MPS can process the object before the client gets to
    see it.  The problem for weak objects is that the client may try and
    access the object at a point in the collection cycle when the MPS
    cannot yet determine the status of the objects that the weak object
    refers to.  What the MPS does in this situation is assume that all
    the referenced objects are going to live.  This assumption is
    correct but conservative; it may result in objects that are
    weakly referenced staying alive for longer than they need to.
    In the worst case this can result in a very large amount of
    memory being used by objects that are no longer needed.  </p>

    <p>
    In order to combat this problem the MPS sometimes does the
    following: Instead of processing the entire weak object and
    unprotecting it so that the client can access the object the MPS may
    emulate the processor instruction.  When this happens the MPS
    doesn't process the entire weak object, it only processes the exact
    location that was being accessed (typically a single word), it
    emulates the processor instruction, and it keeps the object
    protected.  This happens invisibly from the client's perspective,
    it's exactly as if the instruction executed as normal.  The MPS
    instead of processing the entire object processes just a single
    word.</p>

    <p>
    Naturally this emulation business is delicate and hairy and involves
    staring at the most badly written parts of low-level processor
    architecture manuals for days.</p>

    <p>
    Emulation of accesses to protected objects happens when:
    </p>

    <ul>
    <li>The object is a weak object allocated in an AWL pool.</li>

    <li>The MPS is on Linux/IA-32 or Windows/IA-32.  Extending this list
    to new (reasonable) operating systems should be tolerable (for
    example, OS X/IA-32), new processor architectures require more
    work.</li>

    <li>The processor instruction that is accessing the object is of a
    suitable simple form.  The MPS doesn't contain an emulator for all
    possible instructions that might access memory, so it only
    recognises and emulates a few forms of instruction.  Currently this
    is simple MOVs from memory to a register or vice-versa, but it's
    best not to rely on the details.
    </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    Because of this emulation, AWL places a restriction on the format of
    objects allocated in it:
    </p>

    <p>
    All slots in an object must either be a valid word-aligned
    reference, or the bottom bits of the word must be non-zero so that
    it does not look like an aligned pointer.  "Aligned pointer" means a
    word whose numeric value (that is, treated as an unsigned integer)
    is a multiple of the architecture's natural word size (in bytes).
    In the very likely event that you're using a 32-bit machine that
    means that an aligned poiner is a multiple of 4 and its bottom 2
    bits are both 0.  Bottom line: pointers must be untagged and aligned,
    ints must be tagged with a non-zero tag.
    </p>

    <p>
    AWL is one of the few pools that can allocate objects that contain
    non-exact references.  The <code>mps_ap_create</code> method when
    used with an AWL pool accepts an extra argument, which is a
    <em>rank</em> of type <code>mps_rank_t</code>.  The rank is either
    <code>MPS_RANK_EXACT</code> (to allocate ordinary objects contained
    exact references), or <code>MPS_RANK_WEAK</code> (to allocate
    objects that contain weak references).  Example:</p>

    <pre>
    if(MPS_RES_OK != mps_ap_create(&weakap, tablepool, MPS_RANK_WEAK) {
      /* Error. */
      ...
    }
    ...
    </pre>

    <p>[Internal note: has a dummy chain: 2^32KiB 50%]</p>
  </dd>

<h2>AWL: FindDependentMethod and format scan method</h2>

<p>You need to pass a <code>FindDependentMethod</code> to 
  mps_pool_create.
  Here are some notes:</p>
  
<blockquote><pre>
...
The &quot;dependent object&quot; is an object which
the scan method is permitted to update.  The awlScanObject function
Exposes that object before the scan and Covers it afterwards, to allow
the update to take place.  It also discards the MPS &quot;summary&quot; for that
object&apos;s segment (the &quot;summary&quot; of a segment is a conservative
approximation of the objects pointed to by objects in that segment;
since the scan method is now allowed to update the segment to point to
anything else, the summary has to be discarded).

If the keys and values of hash tables are stored in separate linear
tables (a key table and a value table), then for a weak-key table the
scan method for the key table may need to update the value table (to
null out the corresponding value if a key goes away on fix).  So the
dependent object for the key table is the value table.  For weak-value
tables, the relationship is the other way around.

The dylan format works like that, and here&apos;s the relevant code from my
auto-header variant of that.  First dylan_weak_dependent, which is the
dependent-object method.  Then dylan_scan_contig_weak, which is the
innermost part of the scan method for those weak tables.  The comment
&quot;delete corresponding entry&quot; is where the scan method updates the
value table.


/* dylan_weak_dependent -- returns the linked object, if any.
 */

extern mps_addr_t dylan_weak_dependent(mps_addr_t parent)
{
  mps_word_t *object;
  mps_word_t *wrapper;
  mps_word_t fword;
  mps_word_t fl;
  mps_word_t ff;

  assert(parent != NULL);
  object = (mps_word_t *)parent;
  wrapper = (mps_word_t *)object[0];
  assert(dylan_wrapper_check(wrapper));
  fword = wrapper[3];
  ff = fword &amp; 3;
  /* traceable fixed part */
  assert(ff == 1);
  fl = fword &amp; ~3uL;
  /* at least one fixed field */
  assert(fl &gt;= 1);
  return (mps_addr_t) object[1];
}

/* Scan weakly a contiguous array of references in [base, limit). */
/* Only required to scan vectors for Dylan Weak Tables. */
/* Depends on the vector length field being scannable (ie a tagged */
/* integer). */
/* When a reference that has been fixed to NULL is detected the */
/* corresponding reference in the associated table (pointed to be the */
/* assoc variable) will be deleted. */

static mps_res_t
dylan_scan_contig_weak(mps_ss_t mps_ss,
                       mps_addr_t *base, mps_addr_t *limit,
                       mps_addr_t *objectBase, mps_addr_t *assoc)
{
  mps_addr_t *p;
  mps_res_t res;
  mps_addr_t r;

  MPS_SCAN_BEGIN(mps_ss) {
    p = base;
    goto skip_inc;
  loop:
    ++p;
  skip_inc:
    if(p &gt;= limit)
      goto out;
    r = *p;
    if(((mps_word_t)r &amp; 3) != 0) /* non-pointer */
      goto loop;
    if(!MPS_FIX1(mps_ss, r))
      goto loop;
    res = MPS_FIX2(mps_ss, p);
    if(res == MPS_RES_OK) {
      if(*p == 0 &amp;&amp; r != 0) {
        if(assoc != NULL) {
          assoc[p-objectBase] = 0;      /* delete corresponding entry */
        }
      }
      goto loop;
    }
    return res;
  out:
    assert(p == limit);
  } MPS_SCAN_END(mps_ss);

  return MPS_RES_OK;
}

If your scan method won&apos;t need to update any other object while
scanning a weak object, the dependent-object method should return
NULL.
