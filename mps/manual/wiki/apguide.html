<p> This wiki article contains incomplete and informal notes about the MPS, the precursor to more formal documentation.  Not confidential.  Readership: MPS users and developers.  </p>

<p>These notes on Allocation Points were written by RHSK between 
  2006-06-07 and 2006-06-22, following research and discussion with 
  RB and NB.  
  <strong>Warning:</strong> the text in this User's Guide
  is preliminary, but believed to be 'conservatively correct'.
  In other words, I think if you follow these guidelines, your code 
  will be correct, and will not violate the current or future 
  definitions of the MPS ap protocol.  But this is not (yet) an 
  accurate statement of the MPS ap protocol.  RHSK 2006-06-13.</p>

<p>[<strong>Note:</strong> some constraints 
  may be mentioned only here, and not yet in other places they 
  should be mentioned, such as the Reference Manual.
  Notably, the client's obligation to ensure there are no exact 
  references to a failed new-object, before it calls mps_ap_trip, 
  is suspected to be new.  RHSK 2006-06-13]</p>
  
<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Allocation points are an MPS protocol that the client uses to 
  allocate memory with low overhead, and low synchronization 
  cost (with an asynchronous collector and with other threads).</p>

<p>The allocation point protocol is designed to work with 
  incremental collections and multi-threaded clients.  
  (And even if your particular client is 
  single-threaded and non-incremental, 
  for the purposes of using allocation points 
  it's easiest to assume you are coding for this case).</p>

<p>The assumption is that, <em>between any 
  two client instructions</em>, the MPS can interrupt you, move 
  objects around (if they are in a moving pool) and collect 
  garbage.  To cope with this, allocating is a two-step process.</p>

<p><strong>Important:</strong>
  <a id="assume.ambig-workspace" class="tag">.assume.ambig-workspace</a>: 
  this User's Guide 
  assumes that you have declared your stack and registers to 
  be a root that is ambiguously scanned, using mps_root_create_reg 
  and passing the mps_stack_scan_ambig function to it.  
  This is the simplest way to write a client.
  Other scenarios are possible, but 
  their implications for correct Allocation Point use
  are not yet documented here.</p>

<p>The rest of this Allocation Points User's Guide contains the following
  sections:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Creating and destroying allocation points</li>
  <li>Overview of two-step allocation</li>
  <li>The graph of managed references</li>
  <li>mps_reserve</li>
  <li>Building the object</li>
  <li>mps_commit</li>
  <li>Common mistakes</li>
</ul>


<h2>Creating and destroying allocation points</h2>

<p>To create an allocation point in a pool, 
  call <code>mps_ap_create</code>.  
  This may require additional arguments, depending on the pool 
  class.  See pool class documentation.</p>

<p>An allocation point <strong>MUST NOT</strong> be used by more 
  than one thread.  (Each thread must have its own allocation point or 
  points).</p>

<p>Destroy an allocation point with <code>mps_ap_destroy</code>.</p>

<h2>Overview of two-step allocation</h2>

<p>When the client is building (creating and formatting) a new 
  object, you can think of it as being 'in a race' with the MPS.  
  The object is 'under 
  construction', and the MPS cannot manage it in the normal way.  
  So the client should build the object quickly, and then 
  commit it to MPS management.  Rarely, the MPS has to move other
  objects around right in the middle of this build phase: that's 
  a (small) price you pay for having an asynchronous collector.  
  If this happens, the MPS will tell the client that it has 'lost the 
  race'.  Objects have moved around, and the new object is invalid.
  The client must start building it again from scratch.</p>

<p>The client starts building the new object with 
  <code>mps_reserve</code>, and 
  marks it complete by calling <code>mps_commit</code>.  
  Almost always, <code>mps_commit</code> succeeds.  But if the
  client did not complete the object in time, then 
  <code>mps_commit</code> fails (returns 0).</p>

<p>This is how the client should build a new object:</p>
<ol>
  <li> <code>mps_reserve</code> some memory,</li>
  <li> build a new object in it,</li>
  <li> store a reference to the new object in an 
    ambiguously-scanned place
    (but <strong>NOT</strong> in any exactly-scanned place),</li>
  <li> <code>mps_commit</code> the new object to MPS management;</li>
</ol>

<p>If commit succeeds, the object is complete, and immediately 
  becomes just a normal allocated object.  
  The client may write a reference to the 
  new object into some older object (thereby connecting the 
  new object into the client's graph of objects).</p>

<p>If commit fails, the new object no longer exists: 
  the data has gone and any references that used to refer to it 
  are now dangling pointers.  
  The client should simply try to build the 
  object again.</p>

<p>In pseudo-code, the standard allocation point idiom is:</p>
  
<blockquote><pre><code>
  do
    mps_reserve
    initialize new object
    make an ambiguous reference to new object
  while (! mps_commit)
  link new object into my object graph
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p>(Do not worry about getting stuck in this loop: 
  commit usually fails at most once per collection, 
  so it is very rare for commit to fail even once, 
  let alone twice).</p>

<p>In C, this typically looks like this:</p>

<blockquote><pre><code>int make_object(mps_ap_t ap, object *parent)
{
  void *p;
  object *neo = NULL;

  do {
    if (mps_reserve(&amp;p, ap, SIZE_OBJECT) != MPS_RES_OK) {
      goto fail_make_object;
    }
    /* Build the new object */
    neo = p;
    neo-&gt;formatcode = FORMAT_CLIENT;  /* (not fwd or pad) */
    neo-&gt;type = TYPE_OBJECT;
    neo-&gt;size = SIZE_OBJECT;
    neo-&gt;parent = parent;
    neo-&gt;family = parent-&gt;family;
    neo-&gt;child = NULL;
    /* neo (ambiguous reference) preserves the new object */
  } while (! mps_commit(ap, p, SIZE_OBJECT));

  /* Success: link the new object into my object graph */
  parent-&gt;child = neo;
  return TRUE;

fail_make_object:
  return FALSE;  /* out of memory, etc */
}
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p>Note that, throughout this User's Guide, we assume that 
  the stack and registers are declared as ambiguous roots 
  (<a href="#assume.ambig-workspace">.assume.ambig-workspace</a>)
  which means that the <code>neo</code> pointer
  keeps the new object alive for us.</p>

<p>The rest of this User's Guide goes through these steps in more 
  detail.</p>


<h2>The graph of managed references</h2>

<p>The MPS is a moving garbage collector: it supports 
  preserve-by-copying pools, whose objects are 'mobile'.  
  Whenever the MPS moves an object, it will ensure that 
  all managed references are updated to point to the 
  new location -- and this happens instantaneously as far 
  as the client sees it.</p>
  
<p>The client should assume that, between <em>any pair of 
  instructions</em>, the MPS may 'shake' this graph, moving 
  all the mobile objects, and updating all the managed 
  references.</p>

<p>Any parts of the graph that are no longer connected 
  (no longer reachable from declared roots) may be collected, 
  and the memory that those objects occupied may be unmapped, 
  or re-used for different objects.</p>
  
<p>The client usually takes care to ensure that all the 
  references it 
  holds are managed.  To be managed, the reference must be 
  in a declared root (such as a scanned stack or a global variable),
  or in a formatted object that is reachable from a root.</p>
  
<p>It is okay for a careful client to hold unmanaged references, 
  but:</p>
<ul>
  <li> they'd better not be to a mobile object!  Remember, mobile 
    objects could move at any time, and unmanaged references 
    will be left 'dangling'.</li>
  <li> they'd better not be the only reference to an object, 
    or that object might get collected, again leaving a dangling 
    reference.</li>
</ul>

<h2>mps_reserve</h2>

<p>Call <code>mps_reserve</code>, passing the size of the 
  new object you wish to create.  
  The size must be aligned to the pool alignment.  
  This is in contrast to mps_alloc, which (for some pools) allows 
  unaligned sizes.</p>

<p><em class="note">[Normally, use <code>mps_reserve</code> 
  (the lower-case C macro).
  But if you are using a weak compiler that does not detect common
  subexpressions, you may find that using
  <code>MPS_RESERVE_BLOCK</code> (functionally identical) generates 
  faster code.
  Or it may generate slower code. It depends on your compiler, and
  you will have to conduct tests to find out.]</em></p>

<p><code>mps_reserve</code> returns a reference to a piece 
  of new memory for the client to build a new object in.  
  During this build, the MPS pins the piece of memory, and 
  treats it as raw data.</p>

<p>"Pinned" means: it will not move, be collected, be unmapped, 
  or anything like that.  You may keep an unmanaged reference to 
  it at this time.</p>

<p>"Raw data" means two things:</p> 
  
<p>Firstly, "raw data" means that any references stored IN the 
  new object are <em>unmanaged</em>.  This means:</p>
<ul>
  <li> references in the new object will not get updated if 
    the graph of managed references to mobile objects is 'shaken';</li>
  <li> references in the new object do not 
    preserve any old objects they point to.</li>
</ul>

<p>Secondly, "raw data" means that any references TO the new 
  object are treated like other references to unmanaged memory:</p>
<ul>
  <li> the MPS will not call the client's format code to answer 
    questions about the new object.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Building the object</h2>

<p>The client will typically do all these things:</p>
<ul>
  <li> write data that makes the new object 'valid' for the 
       client's format;</li>
  <li> write other data into the new object;</li>
  <li> store references to existing objects IN 
    the new object;</li>
  <li> keep (in a local variable) an ambiguous reference TO the 
    new object.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, during the build, there are a couple of restrictions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Once the client has stored a reference IN the new object, 
      it <strong>MUST NOT</strong> read it out again &mdash;
      any reference stored in the new object is unmanaged, 
      and may have become stale.</p>

    <p>(Actually, the restriction is: the moment a reference to an 
      existing mobile object is written into the new object, that 
      reference (in the new object) may become stale.  And you'd better 
      not use (dereference) a stale reference.  And you'd better not 
      write it into any exactly-scanned cell (such as in an existing 
      object).  
      Reading it into an ambiguously-scanned cell (such as an ambiguously 
      scanned register or stack cell) is okay as long as you don't 
      dereference it.  
      Writing it back into another part of the new object is okay too.  
      Just don't trust it to be a valid reference.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The client <strong>MUST NOT</strong> store a reference TO the 
      new object in any exactly-scanned place.</p>

    <p><em class="note">[Note: this is in fact possible, but the 
      protocol for doing it is more complex, and beyond the scope of 
      this guide.  RHSK 2006-06-22]</em></p>

    <p>This means the client should NOT connect the new object into 
      the graph of managed objects during the build.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Before the end of the build phase:</p>
<ul>
  <li> the new object must be validly formatted;</li>
  <li> all exactly-scanned cells in the new object must
       contain valid references;</li>
  <li> the new object must be ambiguously reachable.</li>
</ul>

<p>Optionally, for improved robustness to bugs, consider initialising 
  <em>all</em> parts of the new object, including parts that are not 
  yet being used to store useful data (such as a string buffer).
  You might want to make this compile-time switchable, for debugging.</p>

<blockquote class="note">
  <p><em class="note">If you leave these unused parts 
    uninitialised, they may contain data that 
    looks like a valid object -- this is called a "spoof object".  
    (This might be the 'ghost' of a previous object, or just random 
    junk that happens to look like a valid object).</em></p>

  <p><em class="note">This is completely legal: spoof objects 
    do not cause a problem for the MPS.</em></p>

  <p><em class="note">
    However, this might leave you with less safety margin than you 
    want, especially when developing a new client.
    If there were to be a bug in your code (or indeed in
    the MPS) that resulted in a bogus exact reference to this spoof, 
    it might go undetected, 
    and arbitrary corruption might occur before the bug came to light.  
    So, consider filling these as-yet unused parts with specially 
    chosen dummy values, at least as an option for debugging.  
    Choose dummy values that your format code will recognise as 
    not permitted at the start of a valid formatted object.
    You will then detect bogus exact references more promptly.</em></p>
  
  <p><em class="note">[RHSK 2006-06-15:
    In poolamc, these ghosts will be forwarding pointers, 
    and they will usually get unmapped (though 
    unless we use zeroed / secure / etc VM they may get mapped-in 
    again intact).  
    But if the tract is nailed they won't even get unmapped.  
    And ghost forwarding pointers are just as bad news as any other 
    spoof.
    There's currently no format method "destroy".  If there was, 
    we could call it in the reclaim phase, to allow format code to 
    safely mark these ghosts as dead.  Actually, perhaps that's a 
    valid use of the 'pad' method?
    ]</em></p>
</blockquote>


<h2>mps_commit</h2>

<p>When you call <code>mps_commit</code>, it will either fail or succeed.</p>

<p>Almost always, <code>mps_commit</code> succeeds.  
  If it succeeds, that means: </p>
<ul>
  <li> all the references written IN the new object are valid (in 
    other words, a successful commit is the MPS's way of telling 
    you that these references did not become stale while they were 
    sitting unmanaged in the new object);</li>
  <li> all the references TO the new object are valid;</li>
  <li> the new object is now just a normal object like any other;</li>
  <li> it may get collected if there are no references 
    to it;</li>
  <li> if the pool supports mps_free, you may manually free the 
    new object.</li>
</ul>

<p>Occasionally but rarely, <code>mps_commit</code> fails.  
  This means:</p>
<ul>
  <li> the new object no longer exists &mdash;
       the memory may even be unmapped by the time 
       <code>mps_commit</code> returns;</li>
  <li> there must be no exact references to the new object.</li>
</ul>

<p>If commit fails, the client usually tries making the object again
  (although this is not required: it is allowed to just give up!).  
  This is why the standard allocation point idiom has a 
  do...while loop.</p>


<h2>Common mistakes</h2>

<p>Here are some examples of mistakes to avoid:</p>

<blockquote><pre><strong>The example below is INCORRECT.</strong>

<code>typedef struct object_s {
  int              formatcode;  /* FORMAT_CLIENT, _FWD, or _PAD */
  int              type;
  size_t           size;
  struct object_s *family;
  struct object_s *parent;
  struct object_s *child;
} object; 

int make_object(mps_ap_t ap, object *parent)
{
  void *p;
  object *neo = NULL;

  do {
    if (mps_reserve(&amp;p, ap, SIZE_OBJECT) != MPS_RES_OK) {
      goto fail_make_object;
    }
    /* Build the new object */
    neo = p;
    neo-&gt;formatcode = FORMAT_CLIENT;
    neo-&gt;type = TYPE_OBJECT;
    neo-&gt;size = SIZE_OBJECT;
    neo-&gt;parent = parent;
    neo-&gt;family = neo-&gt;parent-&gt;family;  /*--- incorrect-1 ---*/
    parent-&gt;child = neo;  /*--- incorrect-2 ---*/
    
    /* neo (ambiguous reference) preserves the new object */
  } while (! mps_commit(ap, p, SIZE_OBJECT));

  neo-&gt;child = NULL;  /*--- incorrect-3 ---*/
  return TRUE;

fail_make_object:
  return FALSE;  /* out of memory, etc */
}

<strong>The example above is INCORRECT.</strong>
</code></pre></blockquote>

<p>Incorrect-1: do not read references from the new object.  
  Dereferencing <code>neo-&gt;parent</code> is illegal.
  (The code should use <code>parent-&gt;family</code>).</p>

<p>Incorrect-2: making an exact reference to the new object is illegal.
  (The code should only do this after a successful commit).</p>

<p>Incorrect-3: the <code>child</code> slot (in this example) is 
  exactly scanned, and it MUST be initialised before the call to 
  commit.
  (The code shown is initialising it too late).</p>


<h2>Conclusion and further details</h2>

<p>Although this User's Guide explains the protocol in terms of the 
  pre-packaged macros 
  <code>mps_reserve</code> and <code>mps_commit</code>, 
  that is a simplification.  
  The MPS allocation point protocol is designed as a
  binary protocol, defined at the level of atomic machine operations.
  The precise specification of the binary protocol is beyond the 
  scope of this document.</p>
