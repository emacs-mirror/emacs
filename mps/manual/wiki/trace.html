<p> This wiki article contains incomplete and informal notes about the MPS, the precursor to more formal documentation.  Not confidential.  Readership: MPS users and developers.  </p>


<h2>Introduction</h2>


<p>Tracing is when the MPS follows the dag or references to find all reachable objects.</p>


<h2>Setting up a trace</h2>


<p><a href="trace.png"><img src="trace.png" alt="MPS Trace setup.  Original drawing: trace.graffle, derived from //info.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/master/code/trace.c#18, 2007-01-08" /></a></p>


<h2>Scan: advance a trace</h2>


<p>The unit of trace scanning is the segment.  Trace calls <code>PoolScan(&amp;wasTotal, &amp;ss, SegPool(seg), seg)</code>.  PoolScan must make the seg <strong>non-grey</strong>, or return a failure code.</p>


<h3>.scan.loop:</h3>

<p>If the seg is full and non-white (eg. all grey) when scanning starts, then a single linear scan will make the seg non-grey (in fact: all black).</p>

<p>Otherwise, there are two ways new grey objects can appear in the segment while we are scanning it:</p>

<p>.scan.loop.white: if the seg contains some white objects when we start a linear scan, then a Ref that points backwards into the same seg can fix and grey an object that was skipped as white when the linear scan passed over it.  So scanning must loop until the whole seg is non-grey.</p>

<p>.scan.loop.buffer: if the seg is buffered, and the buffer is Forwarding-grey or Mutator-grey (not yet implemented), then new grey objects can arrive during the scan.</p>


<h3>.scan.total:</h3>

<p>Total versus non-Total scans</p>

<p>The current design is that the segment summary is <strong>not updated</strong> during the scan, even though the segment is gaining new Refs from relocating fixes.  Instead, the summary of Refs seen by the scan is kept in the scan state: <code>ss-&gt;unfixedSummary</code> and <code>ss-&gt;fixedSummary</code>.</p>

<p>A scan does not necessarily see all objects: objects that were already black at scan start are usually skipped; and objects that remain white at scan end are always skipped.  This is the <code>!wasTotal</code> case, and the fixedSummary resulting from the scan must be unioned into the segment summary.</p>

<p>But if all objects in the segment were scanned (eg. if whole seg was grey at scan start), PoolScan sets <code>wasTotal</code> to true to indicate this.  The trace then uses <code>ss-&gt;fixedSummary</code> to replace the old segment summary.</p>


<h3>Scan details</h3>

<p>This is how a non-trivial scan of a seg happens in AMC:</p>

<pre>
  traceScanSeg  /* without fail: if needed triggers emergency retry (cannot fail) */
    traceScanSegRes
      ScanStateInit
        ss->fix = TraceFix, or TraceFixEmergency
      ShieldExpose
      PoolScan
        (*pool->class->scan)
          AMCScan
            while (buffer still leaving wake)
              (*pool->format->scan)(ss, base, limit);
                [for example]
                dylan_scan
                  mps_fix
                  MPS_FIX12
                    (*ss->fix)(ss, ref_io)
                      TraceFix
                        TraceSetInter(TractWhite(tract(ref)), ss->traces) ?
                          TRACT_SEG?
                            PoolFix(pool, ss, seg, refIO)
                            = (*pool->fix)(pool, ss, seg, refIO)
      ShieldCover
</pre>

<p>Where:</p>

<pre>
PoolFix(pool, ss, seg, refIO)
= (*pool->fix)(pool, ss, seg, refIO)
  AMCFix, AMCHeaderFix
    ShieldExpose
    (*pool->format->isMoved)(ref)
    ShieldCover
</pre>
