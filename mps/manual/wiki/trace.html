<p> This wiki article contains incomplete and informal notes about the MPS, the precursor to more formal documentation.  Not confidential.  Readership: MPS users and developers.  </p>


<h2>Introduction</h2>


<p>Tracing is when the MPS follows the dag or references to find all reachable objects.</p>


<h2>Setting up a trace</h2>


<p><a href="trace.png"><img src="trace.png" alt="MPS Trace setup.  Original drawing: trace.graffle, derived from //info.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/master/code/trace.c#18, 2007-01-08" /></a></p>


<h2>Advancing a trace</h2>


<p>The unit of trace scanning is the Seg.  Trace scanning aims to make a seg <strong>non-grey</strong>.</p>


<h3>Looping to make it non-grey</h3>

<p> Note that refs can point backwards into the same seg, so a single linear scan of seg may not make seg non-grey.  In this case, is ScanSeg defined to loop until non-grey?  Or not?  Where is the loop?  In fact, for AMC, we can't be scanning at Ambig, so any object newly found, preserved, and greyed (during the scan) will be preserved-by-copy, into another segment (or at least -- given that buffers are currently attached at seg end only -- into a definitely <strong>later</strong> part of the same seg).  <em class="note">[I'm not confident of the accuracy of this paragraph -- see moreReturn in amcScanNailedOnce().  RHSK 2007-01-12]</em></p>


<h3>Scan details</h3>

<p>This is how a non-trivial scan of a seg happens in AMC:</p>

<pre>
  traceScanSeg  /* without fail: if needed triggers emergency retry (cannot fail) */
    traceScanSegRes
      ScanStateInit
        ss->fix = TraceFix, or TraceFixEmergency
      ShieldExpose
      PoolScan
        (*pool->class->scan)
          AMCScan
            while (buffer still leaving wake)
              (*pool->format->scan)(ss, base, limit);
                [for example]
                dylan_scan
                  mps_fix
                  MPS_FIX12
                    (*ss->fix)(ss, ref_io)
                      TraceFix
                        TraceSetInter(TractWhite(tract(ref)), ss->traces) ?
                          TRACT_SEG?
                            PoolFix(pool, ss, seg, refIO)
                            = (*pool->fix)(pool, ss, seg, refIO)
      ShieldCover
</pre>

<p>Where:</p>

<pre>
PoolFix(pool, ss, seg, refIO)
= (*pool->fix)(pool, ss, seg, refIO)
  AMCFix, AMCHeaderFix
    ShieldExpose
    (*pool->format->isMoved)(ref)
    ShieldCover
</pre>
