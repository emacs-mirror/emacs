<p> This wiki article contains incomplete and informal notes about the MPS, the precursor to more formal documentation.  Not confidential.  Readership: MPS users and developers.  </p>

<h2>MPS Build System</h2>

<p> Buildsys (the MPS build system) does these things:</p>

<p> Exist 3 dimensions:</p>
<ul>
  <li> PFM -- platform</li>
  <li> TARGET -- the build product (library, test-executable, etc) you want to build</li>
  <li> VARIETY -- eg debug, release, etc</li>
</ul>

<p> 
You can specify these if you wish.  Indeed, you *must* specify PFM, by passing its makefile to make (or nmake) with the -f (or /f) flag.  You may specify TARGET and VARIETY on the command-line to make ("VARIETY=di").
</p>

<p> 
If you don't specify TARGET and VARIETY, the buildsys uses the following defaults:</p>
<ul>
  <li> for TARGET, default is the pseudo-target "all", which is a list that includes mps.a (or mps.lib) and many unit tests;</li>
  <li> for VARIETY, default is to recursively invoke make (or nmake) for each of 'the usual varieties'.</li>
</ul>

<p>
(The pseudo-targets that fill-in these defaults have confusing names: the rule that expands varieties is called "target:" (probably because the TARGET is known by this point), and the rule invoked when TARGET and VARIETY are both known is called "variety:").
</p>

<p> Once values for PFM, TARGET, and VARIETY are known, there's a rule that prepends the path "PFM/VARIETY/" to TARGET, to make sure that the built files will appear in the appropriate subdirectory.  (Effectively making "foo" a useful shorthand for "PFM/VARIETY/foo").
</p>

<h3>How to see the compiler-flags, etc, used by the build</h3>

<p> Try defining NOISY=1 on the make command line.</p>

<p> Or, start by finding the final recursive make call: it will be the command-line that ends with the pseudo-target "variety".  Edit comm.gmk (or commpost.nmk) and add the -n (or /n) flag to that make command.</p>
