<p> This wiki article contains incomplete and informal notes about the MPS, the precursor to more formal documentation.  Not confidential.  Readership: MPS users and developers.  </p>

<h2>Scope of terms</h2>

<p>Terms are marked as being applicable in the following scopes:</p>
<dl>
  <dt> (general) </dt>
  <dd>term in general use in the memory-management community;
    see 
    <a href="http://www.memorymanagement.org/glossary/">The Memory Management Glossary</a>.</dd>
  
  <dt> (mps.h) </dt>
  <dd>term used in the published MPS interface or 
    published documentation, for client programs to use</dd>
  
  <dt> (internal) </dt>
  <dd>term used in internal MPS code or design documentation 
    (not for use in client programs)</dd>
</dl>

<p>Note: often an mps.h term has a related (but not exactly 
  corresponding) internal term.  The distinction can be critical.</p>
    
<h2>Terms</h2>  

<p>Client &asymp; Mutator:</p>
<dl>
  <dt> Client (mps.h) </dt>
  <dd>The program that uses the MPS via the mps.h interface.</dd>
  
  <dt> Mutator (internal) </dt>
  <dd>The computational process that mutates (edits) the graph
    of references</dd>
</dl>

<p>Allocation Point &asymp; Buffer:</p>
<dl>
  <dt> Allocation Point (mps.h) </dt>
  <dd>MPS protocol that client uses to allocate memory with 
    low overhead, and low thread-synchronization cost.</dd>
  
  <dt> Buffer (internal) </dt>
  <dd>A piece of memory held by the MPS, often used to provide 
    memory for an allocation point.</dd>
</dl>


<h3>Pieces of memory</h3>

<h4>Pools getting raw memory from the Arena</h4>
<p>This memory will be used for client objects.  
  There are two interfaces:
   a high-level "segment" interface, 
   and a simpler "arena memory" interface. </p>
<dl>
  <dt> segment (internal) </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>= a contiguous piece of memory of arbitrary size, 
      with associated properties for participating in garbage 
      collection (see SegStruct).</p>
    <p>A pool may call SegAlloc() to request a segment from the arena. 
      The segment is the unit of pool-to-pool and pool-to-MPM 
      interaction for GC.</p>
    <p>Design: <a href="../../design/seg/">design/seg</a>.</p>
    <p>Interface: SegAlloc() et al in <a href="../../code/mpm.h">mpm.h</a>.</p>
    <p>Historical note: before 'sunset on segments' (1999-11-18, change 21000) a 
      segment was a VM page.</p>
  </dd>
  
  <dt> arena memory (internal) </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>= a contiguous piece of memory of arbitrary size, 
      returned by ArenaAlloc()</p>
    <p>A pool may call ArenaAlloc() to request raw memory from the 
      arena.  This is a simpler interface than segments, suitable 
      for simple pools that do not participate in garbage collection, 
      pools used internally by the MPM, etc.</p>
    <p>(Note: this ArenaAlloc() interface is sometimes 
      called the "tract" interface).</p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<h4>Pools getting memory for administrative use</h4> 
<p>This memory will be used for the pool's administrative 
  datastructures, such as allocation 
  tables.</p>
<dl>  
  <dt> control memory (internal) </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>Pools use ControlAlloc() and ControlFree() to obtain 
      or free control memory.</p>
  </dd>
</dl>

<h4>How the arena handles memory</h4>
<p>See tract.c.</p>
<dl>  
  <dt> chunk (internal) </dt>
  <dd>
    <p>= a contiguous (I think) piece of address space that has 
    been reserved (I think) by the arena</p>
    <p>arena-&gt;primary points to the arena's first chunk</p>
  </dd>
  
  <dt> page (internal) </dt>
  <dd>= unit of granularity of arena allocation; object corresponding to one operating-system VM page </dd>
  
  <dt> tract (internal) </dt>
  <dd>= a page that is allocated to a pool</dd>
  
</dl>

<p>Other terms:</p>
<dl>
  <dt> <a id="foreign_code">foreign code</a> (mps.h) </dt>
  <dd>From the MPS client's point of view, foreign code is 
    external code (outside the client and MPS), which is not 
    aware of and does not cooperate with the MPS.  
    Examples include the operating system, graphics libraries,
    etc.
    Before the client passes MPS memory references to foreign 
    code, it must ensure that the memory is not going to be moved, 
    collected, or 
    <a href="http://www.memorymanagement.org/glossary/p.html#protection">protected</a> by the MPS.
    Some pool classes (eg. 
    <a href="pool_classes.html#mps_class_lo"><code>mps_class_lo</code></a>
    ) are specially 
    designed for this.
    </dd>

  <dt> format (mps.h) </dt>
  <dd>A collection of client-implemented Format Methods, 
    which MPS uses to ask the client questions about objects.
    See <a href="gc.html">GC</a>.</dd>

  <dt> Attr (internal) </dt>
  <dd>A bitset of pool or pool class attributes.
    See 
    <a href="../../design/type/index.html#attr">design/type/#attr</a>.
  </dd>

  <dt> Ring (internal) </dt>
  <dd>A Parent node, linked to zero or more Child nodes.  
    Used throughout MPS internals.  See 
    <a href="../../design/ring/index.html">design/ring</a>.
    The <code>RING_FOR</code> macro visits all Child nodes.
    Note: when a node (RingStruct) appears in a larger structure, 
    there is (alas) no indication whether it is the parent node, 
    or a child node.
