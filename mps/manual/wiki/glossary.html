<p> This wiki article contains incomplete and informal notes about the MPS, the precursor to more formal documentation.  Not confidential.  Readership: MPS users and developers.  </p>

<h2>Scope of terms</h2>

<p>Terms are marked as being applicable in the following scopes:</p>
<dl>
  <dt> (general) </dt>
  <dd>term in general use in the memory-management community;
    see 
    <a href="http://www.memorymanagement.org/glossary/">The Memory Management Glossary</a>.</dd>
  
  <dt> (mps.h) </dt>
  <dd>term used in the published MPS interface or 
    published documentation, for client programs to use</dd>
  
  <dt> (internal) </dt>
  <dd>term used in internal MPS code or design documentation 
    (not for use in client programs)</dd>
</dl>

<p>Note: often an mps.h term has a related (but not exactly 
  corresponding) internal term.  The distinction can be critical.</p>
    
<h2>Terms</h2>  

<p>Client &asymp; Mutator:</p>
<dl>
  <dt> Client (mps.h) </dt>
  <dd>The program that uses the MPS via the mps.h interface.</dd>
  
  <dt> Mutator (internal) </dt>
  <dd>The computational process that mutates (edits) the graph
    of references</dd>
</dl>

<p>Allocation Point &asymp; Buffer:</p>
<dl>
  <dt> Allocation Point (mps.h) </dt>
  <dd>MPS protocol that client uses to allocate memory with 
    low overhead, and low thread-synchronization cost.</dd>
  
  <dt> Buffer (internal) </dt>
  <dd>A piece of memory held by the MPS, often used to provide 
    memory for an allocation point.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Other terms:</p>
<dl>
  <dt> Format (mps.h) </dt>
  <dd>A collection of client-implemented Format Methods, 
    which MPS uses to ask questions about objects.
    See <a href="gc.html">GC</a>.</dd>

  <dt> Attr (internal) </dt>
  <dd>A bitset of pool or pool class attributes.
    See 
    <a href="../../design/type/index.html#attr">design/type/#attr</a>.
  </dd>
  
  <dt> Ring (internal) </dt>
  <dd>A Parent node, linked to zero or more Child nodes.  
    Used throughout MPS internals.  See 
    <a href="../../design/ring/index.html">design/ring</a>.
    The <code>RING_FOR</code> macro visits all Child nodes.
    Note: when a node (RingStruct) appears in a larger structure, 
    there is (alas) no indication whether it is the parent node, 
    or a child node.
