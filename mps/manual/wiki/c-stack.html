<p> This wiki article contains incomplete and informal notes about the MPS, the precursor to more formal documentation.  Not confidential.  Readership: MPS users and developers.  </p>

<p> MPS use may involve interrupts, faults, exceptions, etc. </p>

<p> We need to document: </p>
<ul>
  <li> stack faults; </li>
  <li> incremental collection; </li>
  <li> SEH trampoline on Windows; </li>
  <li> ... </li>
</ul> 

<h2> Stack Faults </h2>

<p> The operating system may provide each thread with a limited 
  amount of stack space (the
  <a href="http://www.memorymanagement.org/glossary/c.html#control.stack">control stack</a>
  used for subroutine return addresses), and generate a "stack fault"
  if the thread exceeds it.  This could cause a problem if that 
  thread is in MPS code at the time of the fault. </p>

<p> The Windows runtime environment seems to do something about 
  stack fault prevention / detection / handling, as governed by 
  the /Gs (for compilations) and /GZ (for linking) options.  
  From release 1.105 MPS uses...@@@@
  See <a href="../build-notes/index.txt">build notes</a>.</p>

<p> [Note: it seems that the current MPS has not fully addressed 
  the issue of stack faults. @@@@  </p>


<h3> Preventing stack faults </h3>

<p> On some OSs, the default per-thread stack size is very small.
  <strong>Recommendation: it is wise to check the default, and 
    increase it if necessary</strong>. </p>

<p> The MPS is not deeply recursive.  One conservative estimate of 
  the stack space that should be available when calling the MPS 
  is 2048 bytes (on Windows with x86 instruction set). </p>


<h3> Handling stack faults </h3>

<p> An MPS client that wishes to catch and handle operating-system 
  stack faults must install a handler for them.  If this handler 
  simply increases the available stack space and continues the 
  thread, this should be invisible to the MPS. </p>

<p> But if the handler needs to use MPS-allocated memory or
  references, then we must make sure the MPS is not in the 
  middle of an operation when the stack fault occurs. </p>

<p> To help prevent this, the MPS does a "stack probe"
  to check that there is sufficient stack space
  before beginning each MPS operation (each one that calls
  <code>arenaEnterLock</code> at least).  
  If the space is insufficient
  this probe will generate a stack fault before the MPS
  operation begins. </p>

<p> Note: the stack probe is currently only implemented for 
  the i3 (Intel) architecture when building using mv (Visual 
  Studio).  See <code>span.c</code> and <code>spi3.c</code>. </p>

<p> [Note: if <code>THREAD_SINGLE</code> and
  <code>PROTECTION_NONE</code> are defined, the 
  stack probe is skipped.  This is probably wrong.
