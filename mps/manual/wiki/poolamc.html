<p> This wiki article contains incomplete and informal notes about the MPS, the precursor to more formal documentation.  Not confidential.  Readership: MPS users and developers.  </p>


<h2>Introduction</h2>


<p><em class="note">[Incomplete...  Should eventually go into new Guide section of design/poolamc.  RHSK 2007-01-18]</em></p>

<p>See also <a href="./poolamc-segstate.txt">segment state diagram</a>.</p>

<p>Lots of complex MPS concepts come together in poolamc.  This document first states the problem, and then carves it up to arrive a the solution.</p>


<h2>The Problem</h2>


<p>Input:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Segment mode:
    <ul>
      <li>Mobile</li>
      <li>Board</li>
      <li>Stuck (segment nailed, but no nailboard)</li>
    </ul>        
  </li>
  <li>Tracing at:
    <ul>
      <li>Normal</li>
      <li>Emergency</li>
    </ul>        
  </li>
  <li>Does this fix affect the segment we are scanning?
    <ul>
      <li>Yes: see wiki:trace/.scan.change</li>
      <li>No</li>
    </ul>        
  </li>
  <li>Object type:
    <ul>
      <li>Client</li>
      <li>Fwd</li>
      <li>Pad</li>
    </ul>        
  </li>
  <li>Segment rankset:
    <ul>
      <li>Exact</li>
      <li>Zero (no refs)</li>
      <li>Weak</li>
    </ul>        
  </li>
  <li>Object colour:
    <ul>
      <li>Black for any of N traces</li>
      <li>Grey for any of N traces</li>
      <li>White for any of N traces</li>
    </ul>        
  </li>
  <li>Buffers:
    <ul>
      <li>Buffer types:
        <ul>
          <li>Mutator Grey</li>
          <li>Mutator Black</li>
          <li>Forwarding Grey</li>
        </ul>        
      </li>
      <li>Segment regions:
        <ul>
          <li>Unbuffered</li>
          <li>Trail</li>
          <li>Raw (from Init to Alloc)</li>
          <li>Spare (beyond Alloc)</li>
        </ul>        
      </li>
    </ul>        
  </li>
</ul>  
  
<p>Output</p>

<ul>
  <li>How to do these Operations:
    <ul>
      <li>Whiten</li>
      <li>Scan</li>
      <li>Fix</li>
      <li>Reclaim</li>
      <li>Walk</li>
      <li>Write-barrier hit on Black</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>When to do these segment mode transitions:
    <ul>
      <li>Mobile -> Board</li>
      <li>Mobile -> Stuck</li>
      <li>Board -> Mobile</li>
      <li>Stuck -> Mobile</li>
    </ul>        
  </li>
</ul>


<h2>Colour</h2>

<p>The things that contribute to colour are: SegGrey, SegWhite, SegNailed, segment mode, and (if Board) "nails" (marks in the board).</p>

<p>Buffer colour is an extra complication.</p>


<h2>Segment-mode transitions</h2>

<p>Mobile mode requires the whole seg to be the same colour.  Can the Mobile mode support all the various colour transitions?</p>


<h2>Colour transitions</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Atomic whole segment:
    <ul>
      <li>B&rarr;W (whiten)</li>
      <li>B&rarr;G (greyen to make foundation)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Progressive:
    <ul>
      <li>G&rarr;B (blacken, ie. scan): Attempts whole seg.  </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Random:
    <ul>
      <li>W&rarr;G (greyen by fix)</li>
      <li>W&rarr;B (blacken by fix when rank=&empty;, ie. leaf only)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Unused:
    <ul>
      <li>G&rarr;W</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Board and Stuck modes are used to record ........ er....</p>


<h3>.amc.scan.loop:</h3>

<p>AMC is expected to mostly avoid this.</p>

<p>Non-boarded segs are always all one colour: AMCScan on these always scans all objects.</p>

<p>Boarded segs:</p>
<ul>
  <li>in non-emergency mode: we can't be scanning at Ambig (because only roots can be ambig), so if there's a backwards ref that newly finds an object, it will be preserved and greyed (during the scan) by copy into another segment (or at least -- given that buffers are currently attached at the ends of segments only -- into a definitely <strong>later</strong> part of the same seg).</li>
</ul>

<p>But in emergency mode, all fixing (even of exact refs) is in-place.  In emergency mode, a seg with a board will keep its board.  So AMCScan on boarded segments (the misnamed amsScanNailed and amcScanNailedOnce) must loop: <code>do { newMarks = 0; ... } while (newMarks)</code>.  (Communication between these two happens through the poorly named "moreReturn").  </p>

<p>In emergency mode on a mobile (non-boarded) or already stuck seg, .... [what happens here?]</p>

<p>AMS also has a loop: see <code>do { } while (amsseg->marksChanged)</code> in AMSScan.</p>
