INTRODUCTION

This document helps you write code to use the DLL version of the MPS (that is: the MPS packaged as a dynamically-linked library).  

Readership: all.  Confidential: no.  Status: rough notes, informally peer-reviewed.  Author: RHSK.

Background: The MPS ships in two versions: the static-library version (packaged as a statically-linked library, that is: a .lib file, which is bound into the client executable by the executable's developer), and the DLL version.  To use the DLL version, extra steps are required; this document describes them.

OVERVIEW

The MPS library provides the various functions etc that constitute the mps.h interface.  These are normally declared to the linker as EXPORTS.  

The MPS library also requires various functions to be provided to it by the client: these are called 'plinth functions'.  They are specified in mpslib.h (and for telemetry builds, also mpsio.h).  These are normally declared to the linker as IMPORTS.  

However, any DLL (on Windows) must state, for each linker-import, the *filename* of the DLL that will provide that import.  When building the MPS DLL, we do not know the filename of the DLL that will provide the plinth functions.  It could be "MyApp.exe", "languageruntime.dll", or anything else.  Corollary: the MPS DLL must require no linker-imports.  

The client must provide the required mpslib.h functions in another way.  The client calls mps_lib_callback_register() once for each mpslib.h function, passing a function pointer to the client code that implements that function.  


DLL INTERFACE

The MPS DLL (mpsdy.dll) provides the same exports as the MPS statically-linked library (mps.lib), plus one extra: "mps_lib_callback_register()".  It requires no imports.

Exports are linked automatically by the operating system.  (For example, client code simply calls mps_arena_create(), etc).  

The client must 'manually' provide the mpslib.h functions to the MPS, by calling mps_lib_callback_register(name, function-pointer) one-by-one for each mpslib.h function.  The interface (see mpslibcb.h) is:

  typedef void (*mps_lib_function_t)(void);
  int mps_lib_callback_register(const char *name, mps_lib_function_t f);

Where: "name" specifies the name of the MPS plinth function that the client is providing.  The name is the same as the C identifier used in mpslib.h, EG, "mps_lib_assert_fail".  "f" is a pointer to the function cast to the one-type-fits-all mps_lib_function_t type.  Even though "f" is cast to mps_lib_function_t it must point to a function of the correct type (as specified by the declaration in mpslib.h); the MPS is unlikely to have any way of checking (though of course we reserve the right to check).

The client must do this 'soon after linking': all callbacks must be registered before calling any mps.h function, or behaviour is undefined.  (The MPS will not even be able to assert until at least mps_lib_assert_fail() has been registered).

Once the client registers its mpslib functions, they may be called by the MPS at various times, just as for the statically-linked version of the MPS.  

See mpslib.h for the list of functions the client must register.  There is no way for the client to check that all required callbacks have been successfully registered.  [Should MPS provide a way for the client to check this?  Even linkers report unresolved symbols; surely we should set our sights at least that high. -RHSK]

Scope of the DLL callback-register mechanism's state: currently, the DLL stores the function pointers passed to mps_lib_callback_register() in global static data.  When, whether, and how this is created, shared, and destroyed, is up to the operating system.  The function pointers in the static data are statically initialised to dummy functions.  The client does not need to do anything to the callback-register mechanism on shut-down: storage is reclaimed by the operating system automatically.

[Aside: multiple calls to mps_lib_callback_register() with the same callback name do currently work (later supersedes earlier).  Is this considered to be needed functionality, or might it unhelpfully mask a client bug?  There's also an issue supporting this with future mechanisms -- if we actually manage to get the OS to do the linking, for example.  If it's not needed, we should probably assert to disallow it. -RHSK]

Examples, using release 1.106.0:

From "mpslib.h", the list of functions is:
    extern int mps_lib_get_EOF(void);
    extern mps_lib_FILE *mps_lib_get_stderr(void);
    extern mps_lib_FILE *mps_lib_get_stdout(void);
    extern int mps_lib_fputc(int, mps_lib_FILE *);
    extern int mps_lib_fputs(const char *, mps_lib_FILE *);
    extern void mps_lib_assert_fail(const char *);
    extern void *(mps_lib_memset)(void *, int, size_t);
    extern void *(mps_lib_memcpy)(void *, const void *, size_t);
    extern int (mps_lib_memcmp)(const void *, const void *, size_t);
    extern mps_clock_t mps_clock(void);
    extern mps_clock_t mps_clocks_per_sec(void);
    extern unsigned long mps_lib_telemetry_control(void);

The callback name of each function is just its C identifier.

From "mpslibcb.h":
    int mps_lib_callback_register(const char *, mps_lib_function_t);

Example of registering a callback:
    #include "mpslibcb.h"

    res = mps_lib_callback_register(
      "mps_clock",
      (mps_lib_function_t) my_clock_function
    );
    if(res != MPS_RES_OK) {
      printf("mps_lib_callback_register failed.\n");
      exit(1);
    }


WHAT'S IN THE BOX

Files for MPS DLL, new in 1.105.0:

  mpslibcb.h:  declares the mps_lib_callback_register() interface.

  mpsdy.dll:  the MPS DLL

  mpsdy.lib:  the .lib file produced when linking mpsdy.dll

  (Also included, though not needed for DLLs: mpsplcb.lib.  Whilst the register callback functionality is not required for a statically-linking client, it might be desirable in some circumstances.  The "mpsplcb.lib" provides it: it is simply an 'adaptor' that satisfies all the mpslib.h import requirements with stub functions, and provides the mps_lib_callback_register() interface for the client to pass in function pointers for the stubs to call.  The mpsdy.dll DLL incorporates this same adaptor.)

Files for using the MPS statically-linked library are:

  mps.lib:  the MPS statically-linked library

  mpsplan.lib:  ("ANSI plinth") a working example of implementing the interfaces that the MPS requires the client to provide, namely the "mpslib.h", and, for telemetry versions, "mpsio.h", interfaces.  Source is provided in mpsliban.c and mpsioan.c.


WHAT ELSE HAS CHANGED

Obviously, various linker flags are different to make a DLL.

In addition, the MPS -- in both static .lib and dynamic .dll form -- is now built with /Gs (for compilations) and /GZ (for linking).  This suppresses stack probe / stack check, which would otherwise require __chkesp from C library.
