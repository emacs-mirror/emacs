Release notes
=============

.. _release-notes-1.114:

Release 1.114.0
---------------

New features
............

#. :term:`Ambiguous <ambiguous reference>` :term:`interior pointers`
   now keep objects in :ref:`pool-amc` and :ref:`pool-amcz` pools
   alive.

   This means that if the compiler optimizes away a pointer to the
   base of an object, leaving an interior pointer as the only
   reference keeping the object alive, this does not cause the object
   to be incorrectly collected. Or, if you are writing your own
   compiler, you can now perform such an optimization safely.

   If you require the old behaviour (in which ambiguous interior
   pointers were ignored) then you can set the
   :c:macro:`MPS_KEY_INTERIOR` keyword argument to ``FALSE`` when
   calling :c:func:`mps_pool_create_k`.

#. The logic for deciding which generations should be collected has
   changed. Now, a chain may be scheduled for collection if the new
   size of *any* of its generations exceeds its capacity, and when a
   chain is collected, all generations are collected up to, and
   including, the highest generation whose new size exceeds its
   capacity. This ensures that all generations are collected reliably
   on chains where there is no allocation into the nursery generation.
   See :ref:`topic-collection-schedule`.

   (Previously, only the nursery generation in each chain
   was considered, and a chain was collected up to, but not including,
   the lowest generation whose new size was within its capacity.)



Interface changes
.................

#. There is now a default value (currently 256Â \ :term:`megabytes`)
   for the :c:macro:`MPS_KEY_ARENA_SIZE` keyword argument to
   :c:func:`mps_arena_create_k` when creating a virtual memory arena.
   See :c:func:`mps_arena_class_vm`.

#. The keyword argument :c:macro:`MPS_KEY_AMS_SUPPORT_AMBIGUOUS` now
   defaults to ``TRUE`` in order to better support the general case:
   the value ``FALSE`` is appropriate only when you know that all
   references are exact. See :ref:`pool-ams`.


Other changes
.............

#. The :ref:`pool-ams` pool class no longer triggers the assertion
   ``!AMS_IS_INVALID_COLOUR(seg, i)`` under rare circumstances
   (namely, detaching an :term:`allocation point` from a :term:`grey`
   segment when :c:macro:`MPS_KEY_AMS_SUPPORT_AMBIGUOUS` is
   ``FALSE``). See job001549_.

   .. _job001549: https://www.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/issue/job001549/

#. :c:func:`mps_arena_roots_walk` no longer triggers an assertion
   failure when run twice in succession. See job003496_.

   .. _job003496: https://www.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/issue/job003496/

#. The alignment of :ref:`pool-awl` pools is now configurable via the
   object format, as documented, and is no longer always
   :c:macro:`MPS_PF_ALIGN`. See job003745_.

   .. _job003745: https://www.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/issue/job003745/

#. :program:`mpseventtxt` now successfully processes a telemetry log
   containing multiple labels associated with the same address. See
   job003756_.

   .. _job003756: https://www.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/issue/job003756/

#. :ref:`pool-ams`, :ref:`pool-awl` and :ref:`pool-lo` pools get
   reliably collected, even in the case where the pool is the only
   pool on its generation chain and is allocating into some generation
   other than the nursery. See job003771_.

   .. _job003771: https://www.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/issue/job003771/

#. Allocation into :ref:`pool-awl` pools again reliably provokes
   garbage collections of the generation that the pool belongs to. (In
   release 1.113.0, the generation would only be collected if a pool
   of some other class allocated into it.) See job003772_.

   .. _job003772: https://www.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/issue/job003772/

#. All unreachable objects in :ref:`pool-lo` pools are finalized.
   (Previously, objects on a segment attached to an allocation point
   were not finalized until the allocation point was full.) See
   job003773_.

   .. _job003773: https://www.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/issue/job003773/


.. _release-notes-1.113:

Release 1.113.0
---------------

New features
............

#. In previous releases there was an implicit connection between
   blocks allocated by :ref:`pool-awl` and :ref:`pool-lo` pools, and
   blocks allocated by other automatically managed pool classes.

   In particular, blocks allocated by AWL and LO pools were garbage
   collected together with blocks allocated by :ref:`pool-ams` pools,
   and blocks allocated by :ref:`pool-amc` pools in generation 1 of
   their chains.

   This is no longer the case: to arrange for blocks to be collected
   together you need to ensure that they are allocated in the *same*
   generation chain, using the :c:macro:`MPS_KEY_CHAIN` and
   :c:macro:`MPS_KEY_GEN` keyword arguments to
   :c:func:`mps_pool_create_k`.

   So if you have code like this::

       res = mps_pool_create(&my_amc, arena, mps_class_amc(), my_chain);
       res = mps_pool_create(&my_awl, arena, mps_class_awl());

   and you want to retain the connection between these pools, then you
   must ensure that they use the same generation chain::

       MPS_ARGS_BEGIN(args) {
         MPS_ARGS_ADD(args, MPS_KEY_CHAIN, my_chain);
         res = mps_pool_create_k(&my_amc, arena, mps_class_amc(), args);
       } MPS_ARGS_END(args);

       MPS_ARGS_BEGIN(args) {
         MPS_ARGS_ADD(args, MPS_KEY_CHAIN, my_chain);
         MPS_ARGS_ADD(args, MPS_KEY_GEN, 1);
         res = mps_pool_create_k(&my_awl, arena, mps_class_awl(), args);
       } MPS_ARGS_END(args);


Interface changes
.................

#. When creating a list of keyword arguments, there is no longer any
   need to call :c:func:`MPS_ARGS_DONE`. See :ref:`topic-keyword`.

#. When creating an automatically managed pool using
   :c:func:`mps_pool_create_k`, it is no longer necessary to pass in a
   generation chain. The arena has a default generation chain and this
   is used by all automatically managed pools where no generation
   chain was specified.

#. It is now possible to specify a generation chain for
   :ref:`pool-awl` and :ref:`pool-lo` pool classes, by using the
   optional :c:macro:`MPS_KEY_CHAIN` keyword argument to
   :c:func:`mps_pool_create_k`.

#. It is now possible to specify which generation the :ref:`pool-ams`,
   :ref:`pool-awl`, and :ref:`pool-lo` pool classes allocate new
   objects into, using the optional :c:macro:`MPS_KEY_GEN` keyword
   argument to :c:func:`mps_pool_create_k`.


Other changes
.............

#. The MPS now retains some unused memory instead of returning it to
   the operating system. This reduces unnecessary overhead due to
   system calls, thrashing the operating system's page table, and
   zeroing memory when re-allocated. See job003700_.

   .. _job003700: https://www.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/issue/job003700/


.. _release-notes-1.112:

Release 1.112.0
---------------

New features
............

#. New supported platform ``lii6ll`` (Linux, x86-64, Clang/LLVM).

#. On Windows, you can now request that the MPS allocate address space
   from the top down, allowing a 32-bit executable linked with
   ``/LARGEADDRESSAWARE`` to use the top half of the address space.
   Use the keyword argument :c:macro:`MPS_KEY_VMW3_TOP_DOWN` when
   creating an arena of class :c:func:`mps_arena_class_vm`.

#. On OS X, multi-threaded programs are now supported. See
   :ref:`topic-thread`.

#. On OS X, you can now debug the MPS using ``lldb``.


Interface changes
.................

#. In the :term:`hot` (production) variety, the default assertion handler
   now prints messages to standard error but does *not* terminate the
   program. Even though assertions indicate serious problems in the
   program, an end-user does not always want an application to terminate when
   there is a chance to shut down safely and save work, or even to limp
   along indefinitely.  See :ref:`topic-error-assertion-handling`.

#. The behaviour when an assertion is triggered is now configurable in
   the standard ANSI :term:`plinth` by installing an assertion
   handler. See :c:func:`mps_lib_assert_fail_install`.

#. Functions that take a variable number of arguments
   (:c:func:`mps_arena_create`, :c:func:`mps_pool_create`,
   :c:func:`mps_ap_create`) and their ``va_list`` alternatives
   (:c:func:`mps_arena_create_v` etc.) are now deprecated in favour of
   functions that use a :term:`keyword argument` interface
   (:c:func:`mps_arena_create_k`, :c:func:`mps_pool_create_k`,
   :c:func:`mps_ap_create_k`).

   Similarly, the object format variant structures
   (:c:type:`mps_fmt_A_s` etc.) and the functions that take them as
   arguments (:c:func:`mps_fmt_create_A` etc.) are now deprecated in
   favour of :c:func:`mps_fmt_create_k`.

   The new interfaces provide better reporting of errors, default
   values for arguments, and forward compatibility. See
   :ref:`topic-keyword`.

   The old interfaces continue to be supported for now, but new
   features will become available through the keyword interface only.

#. :ref:`pool-mfs` pools no longer refuse to manage blocks that are
   smaller than the platform alignment. They now round up smaller
   sizes internally if necessary.

#. :ref:`pool-mvt` pools now allow the client to specify the alignment
   of blocks. Use the keyword argument :c:macro:`MPS_KEY_ALIGN` when
   creating a pool of class :c:func:`mps_class_mvt`.

#. On OS X, signals are no longer used for handling memory protection
   exceptions. This means that programs are free to handle ``SIGBUS``,
   but must not install a thread-local Mach exception handler for
   ``EXC_BAD_ACCESS`` exceptions. See :ref:`topic-thread-signal`.

#. On OS X, when debugging with ``gdb``, you no longer need to turn on
   ``dont-handle-bad-access`` or to request special handling of
   ``SIGBUS``.


Other changes
.............

#. On Windows, an execute exception no longer triggers an assertion.
   See job003301_.

   .. _job003301: https://www.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/issue/job003301/

#. Rehashing of large address-based hash tables no longer provokes a
   nursery collection that immediately renders the hash table stale
   again. See job003435_.

   .. _job003435: https://www.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/issue/job003435/

#. An :ref:`pool-mvt` pool no longer triggers an assertion failure
   when it runs out of space on its reserved block queue. See
   job003486_.

   .. _job003486: https://www.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/issue/job003486/

#. The ``-i`` and ``-o`` options no longer cause
   :program:`mpseventsql` to crash. See job003507_.

   .. _job003507: https://www.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/issue/job003507/

#. On Windows, telemetry files now have correct clock values.
   Previously the top 32 bits were incorrectly output as zero. See
   job003519_.

   .. _job003519: https://www.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/issue/job003519/

#. On 64-bit Windows, it's no longer possible to get a stack overflow
   exception while the MPS is holding the arena lock. See job003640_.

   .. _job003640: https://www.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/issue/job003640/


.. _release-notes-1.111:

Release 1.111.0
---------------

New features
............

#. Reporting features have been removed from the :ref:`mpseventcnv
   <telemetry-mpseventcnv>` utility. Instead, the telemetry system
   comes with two new utility programs to assist with reporting and
   analysis: :ref:`mpseventtxt <telemetry-mpseventtxt>` converts an
   event stream into human-readable form, and :ref:`mpseventsql
   <telemetry-mpseventsql>` loads an event stream into a SQLite
   database for further analysis. See :ref:`topic-telemetry`.

#. The new pool class :ref:`pool-mfs` provides manually managed
   allocation of fixed-size objects.

#. The new pool class :ref:`pool-mvt` provides manually managed
   allocation of variable-size objects using a *temporal fit*
   allocation policy (that is, objects that are allocated togther are
   expected to be freed together).


Interface changes
.................

#. It is no longer necessary for client programs to use
   :c:func:`mps_tramp` to ensure that exceptions due to barrier hits
   are caught. This function is now deprecated.

#. You can set the environment variable
   :envvar:`MPS_TELEMETRY_CONTROL` to ``all`` to make the telemetry
   system output all events. See :ref:`topic-telemetry`.

#. New functions :c:func:`mps_telemetry_get`,
   :c:func:`mps_telemetry_set` and :c:func:`mps_telemetry_reset`
   provide a more convenient interface to telemetry control than
   :c:func:`mps_telemetry_control`, which is now deprecated. See
   :ref:`topic-telemetry`.

#. The pool classes :ref:`pool-mv` and :ref:`pool-snc` are now
   deprecated.

#. Allocation frames are now deprecated. See :ref:`topic-frame`.

#. Additionally, the functions :c:func:`mps_arena_expose`,
   :c:func:`mps_arena_unsafe_expose_remember_protection`,
   :c:func:`mps_arena_unsafe_restore_protection`,
   :c:func:`mps_arena_roots_walk`, and :c:func:`mps_fix` are now
   deprecated.


Other changes
.............

#. :c:func:`mps_arena_step` no longer unclamps the arena as a side
   effect. If the arena is clamped or parked before calling
   :c:func:`mps_arena_step`, it is clamped afterwards. See job003320_.

   .. _job003320: https://www.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/issue/job003320/

#. The ambiguous stack scanner, :c:func:`mps_stack_scan_ambig`, no
   longer asserts on Linux when there are multiple threads. See
   job003412_.

   .. _job003412: https://www.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/issue/job003412/

#. It is no longer possible for the "ramp" allocation pattern,
   :c:func:`mps_alloc_pattern_ramp()`, to get stuck. Now
   :c:func:`mps_ap_alloc_pattern_end` reliably clears this pattern.
   See job003454_.

   .. _job003454: https://www.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/issue/job003454/

#. The build system now correctly detects the FreeBSD operating system
   running on the x86-64 architecture, for FreeBSD version 9.1 or
   later. See job003473_.

   .. _job003473: https://www.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/issue/job003473/
