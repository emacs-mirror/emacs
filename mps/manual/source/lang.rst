    ALGOL

        ALGOL, designed in 1958 for scientific computing, was the first block-structured language. It spawned a whole family of languages, and inspired many more, including :term:`Scheme`, :term:`Simula` and :term:`Pascal`.

        The block structure of ALGOL 60 induced a :term:`stack allocation` discipline. It had limited dynamic arrays, but no general :term:`heap allocation`. The substantially redesigned ALGOL 68 had both heap and stack allocation. It also had something like the modern :term:`pointer` type, and required :term:`garbage collection` for the heap. The new language was complex and difficult to implement, and it was never as successful as its predecessor.

    BASIC

        BASIC is a simple and easily-learned programming language developed by T. E. Kurtz and J. G. Kemeny in 1963–4. The motivation was to make computers easily accessible to undergraduate students in all disciplines.

        Most BASICs had quite powerful string handling operations that required a simple :term:`garbage collector`. In many implementations, the garbage collector could be forced to run by running the mysterious expression ``FRE("")``.

        BASIC is now old-fashioned, but survives as a scripting language, in particular in Visual BASIC, which is an application development environment with a BASIC-like scripting language. These descendants invariably have automatic memory management as well.

    C

        C is a systems programming language sometimes described as "a portable assembler" because it was intended to be sufficiently low-level to allow performance comparable to assembler or machine code, but sufficiently high-level to allow programs to be reused on other platforms with little or no modification.

        :term:`Memory management` is typically manual (the standard library functions for :term:`memory (2)` management in C, :term:`malloc` and :term:`free (2)`, have become almost synonymous with :term:`manual memory management`), although with the Boehm-Weiser :term:`collector (1)`, it is now possible to use :term:`garbage collection`.

        The language is notorious for fostering large numbers of memory management bugs, including:


        1. Accessing arrays with indexes that are out of bounds;

        2. Using :term:`stack-allocated <stack allocation>` structures beyond their :term:`lifetimes <lifetime>` (see :term:`use after free`);

        3. Using :term:`heap-allocated <heap allocation>` structures after :term:`freeing <free (1)>` them (see :term:`use after free`);

        4. Neglecting to free heap-allocated objects when they are no longer required (see :term:`memory leak`);

        5. Failing to allocate memory for a :term:`pointer` before using it;

        6. Allocating insufficient memory for the intended contents;

        7. Loading from allocated memory before storing into it;

        8. Dereferencing non-pointers as if they were pointers.

    COBOL

        COBOL was designed by the CODASYL committee in 1959–60 to be a business programming language, and has been extended many times since. It is still the most widely-used programming language (in terms of lines of code in use).

        Prior to 2002, COBOL had no :term:`heap allocation`, and did well in its application domain without it. COBOL 2002 has :term:`pointers <pointer>` and heap allocation through ``ALLOCATE`` and ``FREE``, mainly in order to be able to use C-style interfaces. It also supports a high level of abstraction through object-oriented programming and :term:`garbage collection` (including :term:`finalization`).

    Common Lisp

        Common Lisp is the major dialect of the :term:`Lisp` family. In addition to the usual Lisp features, it has an advanced object system, data types from hash tables to complex numbers, and a rich standard library.

        Common Lisp is a :term:`garbage-collected <garbage collection>` language, and modern implementations, such as `LispWorks <http://www.lispworks.com/>`_ and `Allegro CL <http://www.franz.com/products/allegro-common-lisp/>`_, include advanced features, such as :term:`finalization` and :term:`weakness <weak reference (1)>`.

            `Common Lisp HyperSpec <http://www.lispworks.com/documentation/HyperSpec/Front/>`_.

    C++

        C++ is a (weakly) object-oriented language, extending the systems programming language :term:`C` with a multiple-inheritance class mechanism and simple method dispatch.

        The standard library functions for :term:`memory (2)` management in C++ are ``new`` and ``delete``. The higher abstraction level of C++ makes the bookkeeping required for :term:`manual memory management` even harder. Although the standard library provides only manual memory management, with the Boehm-Weiser :term:`collector (1)`, it is now possible to use :term:`garbage collection`. :term:`Smart pointers <smart pointer>` are another popular solution.

        The language is notorious for fostering large numbers of memory management bugs, including:

        1. Using :term:`stack-allocated <stack allocation>` structures beyond their :term:`lifetimes <lifetime>` (see :term:`use after free`);

        2. Using :term:`heap-allocated <heap allocation>` structures after :term:`freeing <free (1)>` them (see :term:`use after free`);

        3. Neglecting to free heap-allocated objects when they are no longer required (see :term:`memory leak`);

        4. Excessive copying by copy :term:`constructors <constructor (1)>`;

        5. Unexpected sharing due to insufficient copying by copy constructors;

        6. Allocating insufficient memory for the intended contents;

        7. Accessing arrays with indexes that are out of bounds.

        .. historical::

            C++ was designed by Bjarne Stroustrup, as a minimal object-oriented extension to C. It has since grown to include some other modern programming language ideas. The first implementations were preprocessors that produced C code, but modern implementations are dedicated C++ compilers.

        Ellis and Stroustrup write in *The Annotated C++ Reference Manual*:

            C programmers think memory management is too important to be left to the computer. Lisp programmers think memory management is too important to be left to the user.

    Dylan

        Dylan is a modern programming language invented by Apple around 1993 and developed by `Harlequin <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlequin_(software_company)>`_ and other partners. The language is a distillation of the best ideas in dynamic and object-oriented programming. Its ancestors include :term:`Lisp`, :term:`Smalltalk`, and :term:`C++`. Dylan is aimed at building modular component software and delivering safe, compact applications. It also facilitates the rapid development and incremental refinement of prototype programs.

        Dylan provides :term:`automatic memory management`. The generic allocation function is called ``make``. Most implementations provide :term:`finalization` and :term:`weak <weak reference (1)>` hash tables, although interfaces for these features have not yet been standardized.  An object may be registered for finalization via the function ``finalize-when-unreachable``, in which case there will be a call to the ``finalize`` function once the :term:`garbage collector`  has determined that the object is :term:`unreachable`. Weak hash tables may have either weak keys or values, depending on a parameter supplied at allocation time. A hash table entry will be deleted once the garbage collector has determined that there are no :term:`strong references <strong reference>` to the key or value of the entry, for weak key or value tables, respectively.

    Emacs Lisp

        Emacs Lisp or elisp is a dialect of :term:`Lisp` used in the Emacs family of text editors, of which the most widely-used is `GNU Emacs <http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/emacs.html>`_.

        Like most Lisps, Emacs Lisp requires :term:`garbage collection`. GNU Emacs has a simple :term:`mark-sweep` collector. It has been speculated that the non-:term:`incremental <incremental garbage collection>` nature of the Emacs collector, combined with the fact that it formerly printed a message whenever it collected, gave garbage collection a bad name in programming circles.

        Erik Naggum reported at the time:

            I have run some tests at the U of Oslo with about 100 users who generally agreed that Emacs had become faster in the latest Emacs pretest. All I had done was to remove the "Garbage collecting" message which people perceive as slowing Emacs down and tell them that it had been sped up. It is, somehow, permissible for a program to take a lot of time doing any other task than administrative duties like garbage collection.

        Emacs was originally written in Teco, not in Lisp, but it still had a garbage collector, though this was heuristic and conservative in nature. Teco-based Emacs was capable of running for weeks at a time in a 256 kB :term:`address space`.

    Fortran

        Fortran, created in 1957, was one of the first languages qualifying as a high-level language. It is popular among scientists and has substantial support in the form of numerical libraries. For a long time, it had :term:`static allocation` only. The Fortran 90 standard added recursion with :term:`stack allocation` (automatic arrays). It also added :term:`dynamic allocation` using ``ALLOCATE`` with manual deallocation using ``DEALLOCATE``.

    Java

        A modern object-oriented language with a rich collection of useful features. The Java language started as an attempt by the Java group at Sun Microsystems to overcome software engineering problems introduced by :term:`C++`. Key reasons for the language's success were the security model and the portable execution environment, the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which created a lot of interest for it as a platform for distributed computing on open networks.

        Java is :term:`garbage-collected <garbage collection>`, as this facilitates object-oriented programming and is essential for security (which :term:`use after free` would break). It had :term:`finalization` from version 1.0 and three kinds of :term:`weakness <weak reference (1)>` from version 1.2 (confusingly, part of the Java 2 Platform).

        Early JVMs had simple collectors that didn't scale well for large programs, but the current crop is catching up to the state of the art.

    JavaScript

        JavaScript is a scripting language used by web browsers. The loose type system resembles other scripting languages, although the syntax follows :term:`C`. There's a prototype-based object system. Note that JavaScript is not related to :term:`Java` in any way except name. There's a standard by `ECMA <http://www.ecma-international.org>`_, known as ECMAScript.

        Despite the :term:`C++`\-like syntax (with ``new`` and ``delete`` operators), JavaScript is :term:`garbage-collected <garbage collection>`.

    Lisp

        Lisp is a family of computer languages combining functional and procedural features with automatic memory management.

        Lisp was invented by John McCarthy around 1958 for the manipulation of symbolic expressions. As part of the original implementation of Lisp, he invented :term:`garbage collection`. He noted:

            This process, because it is entirely automatic, is more convenient for the programmer than a system in which he has to keep track of lists and erase unwanted lists.

        Modern Lisp implementations, such as `LispWorks <http://www.lispworks.com/>`_ and `Allegro CL <http://www.franz.com/products/allegro-common-lisp/>`_, have advanced :term:`garbage collectors <garbage collector>`.

        Lisp is now used for all kinds of symbolic programming and other advanced software development. Major dialects today are :term:`Emacs Lisp`, :term:`Common Lisp` and :term:`Scheme`. Most modern dialects and related languages, such as :term:`Dylan`, are object-oriented.

    Lisp Machine

        Of particular interest in the history of memory management are the *Lisp Machines*, early workstation computers built around a custom processor designed to improve the execution speed of Lisp by implementing primitive Lisp operations in microcode. The Lisp Machine :term:`garbage collector` is a generalization of the algorithm described in [BAKER78]_ and used a technique similar to that described in [UNGAR84]_, but utilizing hardware to improve performance.

        A description of the garbage collector of one particular model is in [MOON84]_. The features important for its performance were:

        1. Hardware support for data typing using tags;

        2. Reference-based :term:`read barriers <read barrier>` for :term:`incremental <incremental garbage collection>` collecting;

        3. :term:`Write barriers <write barrier>` for :term:`remembered sets <remembered set>` and :term:`generational <generational garbage collection>` collecting;

        4. A tight integration with the :term:`virtual memory (1)` system.

        The remembered sets were based on a :term:`BIBOP` division of the virtual :term:`address space`. The Lisp Machine :term:`page-table <page table>`, unlike virtually all modern virtual memory systems, was a flat, hash-based table (sometimes called an :term:`inverted page table`), and thus insensitive to sparsely-populated virtual address spaces associated with BIBOP schemes.

        These custom processors eventually lost out to rapidly advancing stock hardware. Many of the techniques pioneered on Lisp Machines are used in today's implementations, at a cost of a few more cycles.

    ML

        ML is a family of strongly-typed functional languages, of which the principal members are Standard ML and Caml.

        Like other functional languages, ML provides :term:`automatic memory management`. Modern ML implementations usually have advanced :term:`garbage collectors <garbage collector>`. The combination of clean functional semantics and strong typing allows advanced techniques, such as :term:`region inference`.

        The Standard ML of New Jersey (SML/NJ) system, which implements a slight variant of Standard ML, has been important to memory management research for three reasons. Firstly, the source code is publicly available and widely ported, allowing experimentation with both the :term:`collector (2)` and :term:`mutator`. Secondly, the compiler generates code that does not use a :term:`control stack`, but :term:`allocates <allocate>` function :term:`activation records <activation record>` on the :term:`heap` instead. This means that the allocation rate is very high (up to one byte per instruction), and also that the collector has a very small :term:`root set`. Thirdly, it uses a simple :term:`copying collector <copying garbage collection>` that is easy to modify.

    Modula-3

        An object-oriented descendant of :term:`Pascal`.

        Modula-3 is mostly :term:`garbage-collected <garbage collection>`, although it is possible to use :term:`manual memory management` in certain modules.

    Pascal

        An imperative language characterized by block structure and a relatively strong (for its time) static type system. Pascal was designed by Niklaus Wirth around 1970.

        Pascal was popular as a teaching language due to its small size, but it lacked many features needed for applications programming. Now it's been largely supplanted by its more feature-rich descendants Modula-2, :term:`Modula-3`, and Oberon, mainly surviving in the popular Delphi development tool.

        Pascal uses :term:`manual memory management` (with the operators ``NEW`` and ``DISPOSE``). The descendants mentioned all offer :term:`automatic memory management`.

    Perl

        Perl is a complex but powerful language that is an eclectic mixture of scripting languages and programming languages.

        Perl programmers can work with strings, arrays, and associative arrays without having to worry about :term:`manual memory management`. Perl is well-suited to complex text file manipulation, such as report generation, file format conversion, and web server CGI scripts. It is also useful for rapid prototyping, but large Perl scripts are often unmaintainable.

        Perl's :term:`memory management` is well-hidden, but is based on :term:`reference counts <reference counting>` and :term:`garbage collection`. It also has *mortal* variables, whose :term:`lifetimes <lifetime>` are limited to the current context. It is possible to :term:`free (1)` the :term:`memory (2)` assigned to variables (including arrays) explicitly, by ``undef``\-ing the only reference to them.

    PostScript

        The PostScript language is an interpretive language with powerful graphics features, widely used as a page description language for printers and typesetters.

        The  Level 1 PostScript language has a simple :term:`stack`\-like memory management model, using ``save`` and ``restore`` operators to :term:`recycle` memory. The Level 2 PostScript language adds :term:`garbage collection` to this model.

    Prolog

        A logic programming language invented by Alain Colmerauer around 1970, Prolog is popular in the AI and symbolic computation community. It is special because it deals directly with relationships and inference rather than functions or commands.

        Storage is usually managed using a :term:`garbage collector`, but the complex control flow places special requirements on the collector.

    Scheme

        A small functional language blending influences from :term:`Lisp` and :term:`Algol`.

        Key features of Scheme include symbol and list operations, :term:`heap allocation` and :term:`garbage collection`, lexical scoping with first-class function objects (implying :term:`closures <closure>`), reliable tail-call elimination (allowing iterative procedures to be described tail-recursively), the ability to dynamically obtain the current :term:`continuation` as a first-class object, and a language description that includes a formal semantics.

        Scheme has been gaining popularity as an extension language; Project GNU's extension package of choice, `Guile <http://www.gnu.org/software/guile/>`_, is a Scheme interpreter. :term:`Garbage collection` is an important part of the ease of use that is expected from an extension language.

    Simula

        Simula was designed as a language for simulation, but it expanded into a full general-purpose programming language and the first object-oriented language.

        Simula I, designed in 1962–64 by Kristen Nygaard and Ole-Johan Dahl, was based on :term:`ALGOL` 60, but the :term:`stack allocation` discipline was replaced by a two-dimensional :term:`free-list <free list>`.

        It was Simula 67 that pioneered classes and inheritance to express behavior. This domain-oriented design was supported by :term:`garbage collection`.

    Smalltalk

        Smalltalk is an object-oriented language with single inheritance and message-passing.

        :term:`Automatic memory management` is an essential part of the Smalltalk philosophy. Many important techniques were first developed or implemented for Smalltalk.
