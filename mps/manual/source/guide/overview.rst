Overview of the Memory Pool System
==================================

The Memory Pool System is a very general, adaptable, flexible,
reliable, and efficient memory management system. It permits the
flexible combination of memory management techniques, supporting
:term:`manual <manual memory management>` and :term:`automatic memory
management`, :term:`inline allocation <inline allocation (1)>`,
:term:`finalization`, :term:`weakness <weak reference (1)>`, and
multiple concurrent co-operating :term:`incremental <incremental
garbage collection>` :term:`generational <generational garbage
collection>` :term:`garbage collections`. It also
includes a library of :term:`memory pool classes <pool class>`
implementing specialized memory management policies.

The MPS has been in development since 1994 and deployed in successful
commercial products since 1997. Bugs are almost unknown in
production. It is under continuous development and support by
Ravenbrook.

The MPS is distributed under an :ref:`open source license
<license>`. The license is designed to make it possible for you to use
the MPS in your own projects, provided that you either don't
distribute your product, or your product is open source too.

If the licensing terms aren't suitable for you (for example, you're
developing a closed-source commercial product or a compiler run-time
system) you can easily license the MPS under different terms from
Ravenbrook by arrangement. Please :ref:`contact us <contact>` at
`mps-questions@ravenbrook.com <mailto:mps-questions@ravenbrook.com>`_
for details.


Technical introduction
----------------------

The figure below gives a simplified picture of a program's memory from
the point of view of the Memory Pool System.

        Overview of the Memory Pool System.

The **arena** is the top-level data structure in the MPS. An
:term:`arena` is responsible for requesting :term:`memory (3)` from
the operating system (and returning it), for making memory available
to :term:`pools`, and for :term:`garbage collection`. Multiple
arenas are supported, but it's usually best to have only one arena in
your program, because the MPS can't collect cyclic structures that
span multiple arenas. See :ref:`topic-arena`.

The MPS is designed to co-operate with other memory managers (for
example :term:`malloc` and :term:`free (2)` in :term:`C`, or operators
``new`` and ``delete`` in :term:`C++`), so you need not move all your
memory management to the MPS at once, and you can co-operate with
libraries that use other allocation mechanisms.

Within the arena you create one or more **pools**. A :term:`pool` is
responsible for requesting memory from the :term:`arena` and making it
available to your program. See :ref:`topic-pool`.

Pools belong to **pool classes** that specify policies for how their
memory is managed. Some pools are :term:`manually managed <manual
memory management>` (you must call :c:func:`mps_free` to return a
block of memory to the pool) and others are :term:`automatically
managed <automatic memory management>` (the :term:`garbage collector`
reclaims :term:`unreachable` blocks). See :ref:`pool`.

Automatically managed pools need you to tell them how to **scan** for
:term:`references` to allocated blocks. See
:ref:`topic-scanning`.

The arena needs you to tell it how to find your **roots**: references
to allocated blocks that are stored in static data, in memory not
managed by the MPS, or on your program's :term:`registers` or :term:`control stack`. See :ref:`topic-root`.

The MPS is designed to work with multi-threaded programs. Functions in
the C interface are thread safe, except in a few documented
cases. See :ref:`topic-thread`. The :term:`allocation point
protocol` provides fast lock-free allocation on multiple threads
simultaneously. See :ref:`topic-allocation`.

The garbage collector is :term:`incremental <incremental garbage
collection>`: it proceeds in small steps interleaved with the execution
of your program, so there are no long waits. See
:ref:`topic-collection`.

to learn how to integrate it with the Memory Pool System. See
