Debugging with the Memory Pool System
=====================================

Memory management errors are some of the most stubborn and difficult
to track down, because the effect so often appears at a distant point
in the program that is seemingly unrelated to the cause, and by the
time the error is revealed, the information needed to reconstruct the
cause has long vanished. Immediately after an :term:`overwriting
error`, the block that overran its bounds is fine, and the block that
was overwritten may not be visited for a long time. A failure to
:term:`fix` a :term:`reference` does not necessarily cause the object
pointed to by the missed reference to die immediately: there may be
other references to that object, or a garbage collection may be
delayed. And even if it does die, the space it occupies may not be
re-allocated for some time.


General debugging advice
------------------------

1. Compile with debugging information turned on (``-g`` on the GCC or
   Clang command line).

2. .. index::
      single: cool variety
      single: variety; cool

   Build the :term:`cool` :term:`variety` of the MPS (by defining the
   preprocessor constant ``CONFIG_VAR_COOL``, for example by setting
   ``-DCONFIG_VAR_COOL`` on the GCC or Clang command line). This
   variety contains many internal consistency checks (including such
   checks on the :term:`critical path`, which make it too slow for use
   in production), and can generate profiling output in the form of
   the :term:`telemetry stream`.

3. .. index::
      single: ASLR
      single: address space layout randomization

   Prepare a reproducible test case if possible. The MPS may be
   :term:`asynchronous <asynchronous garbage collector>`, but it is
   deterministic, so in single-threaded applications you should be
   able to get consistent results. (But you need to beware of `address
   space layout randomization`_: if you perform computation based on
   the addresses of objects, for example, hashing objects by their
   address, then ASLR will cause your hash tables to be laid out
   differently on each run, which may affect the order of memory
   management operations.)

   .. _address space layout randomization: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization

   A fact that assists with reproducibility is that the more
   frequently the collector runs, the sooner and more reliably errors
   are discovered. So if you have a bug that's hard to reproduce, or
   which manifests itself in different ways on different runs, you may
   be able to provoke it more reliably, or get a more consistent
   result, by having a mode for testing in which you run frequent
   collections (by calling :c:func:`mps_arena_collect` followed by
   :c:func:`mps_arena_release`), perhaps as frequently as every
   allocation.

4. .. index::
      single: debugger
      single: abort
      single: barrier; handling in debugger

   Run your test case inside the debugger. Use ``assert`` and
   ``abort`` in your error handler (rather than ``exit``) so that you
   can enter the debugger with the contents of the control stack
   available for inspection.

   You may need to make sure that the debugger isn't entered on
   :term:`barrier (1)` hits (because the MPS uses barriers to protect
   parts of memory, and barrier hits are common and expected).

   In particular, if you are using GDB on Mac OS X, you will need to
   run these commands::

        set dont-handle-bad-access 1
        handle SIGBUS pass nostop noprint

   Add them to your ``.gdbinit`` if appropriate.


.. index::
   single: underscanning
   single: bug; underscanning

.. _guide-debug-underscanning:

Example: underscanning
----------------------

An easy mistake to make is to omit to :term:`fix` a :term:`reference`
when :term:`scanning <scan>` a :term:`formatted object`. For example,
in the Scheme interpreter's :ref:`scan method <guide-lang-scan>`, I
might have forgetten to fix the first element of a pair:

.. code-block:: c
    :emphasize-lines: 2

    case TYPE_PAIR:
      /* oops, forgot: FIX(CAR(obj)); */
      FIX(CDR(obj));
      base = (char *)base + ALIGN(sizeof(pair_s));
      break;

This means that as far as the MPS is concerned, the first element of
the pair is :term:`unreachable` and so :term:`dead`, so after
collecting the region of memory containing this object, the space will
be reused for other objects. So ``CAR(obj)`` might end up pointing to
the start of a valid object (but the wrong one), or to the middle of a
valid object, or to an unused region of memory, or into an MPS
internal control structure.

The reproducible test case is simple. Run a garbage collection by
calling ``(gc)`` and then evaluate any expression::

    (gdb) print (char *)symbol->symbol.string
    $1 = 0x1003faf30 "foo"

The backtrace shows that the interpreter is in the middle of looking
up the symbol ``foo`` in the environment. The Scheme intrepreter
implements the environment as a list of *frames*, each of which is a
list of *bindings*, each binding being a pair of a symbol and its
value, as shown here:

.. figure:: ../diagrams/scheme-env.svg
    :align: center
    :alt: Diagram: The environment data structure in the Scheme interpreter.

    The environment data structure in the Scheme interpreter.

In this case, because the evaluation is taking place at top level,
there is only one frame in the environment (the global frame). And
it's this frame that's corrupt:

.. code-block:: none
    :emphasize-lines: 10

    (gdb) frame 3
    #3  0x0000000100003f55 in lookup_in_frame (frame=0x1003fa7d0, symbol=0x1003faf20) at scheme.c:1066
    1066            assert(TYPE(frame) == TYPE_PAIR);
    (gdb) list
    1061         */
    1062        
    1063        static obj_t lookup_in_frame(obj_t frame, obj_t symbol)
    1064        {
    1065          while(frame != obj_empty) {
    1066            assert(TYPE(frame) == TYPE_PAIR);
    1067            assert(TYPE(CAR(frame)) == TYPE_PAIR);
    1068            assert(TYPE(CAAR(frame)) == TYPE_SYMBOL);
    1069            if(CAAR(frame) == symbol)
    1070              return CAR(frame);
    (gdb) print frame->type.type
    $2 = 13

The number 13 is the value ``TYPE_PAD``. So instead of the expected
pair, ``frame`` points to a :term:`padding object`.

You might guess at this point that the frame had not been fixed, and
since you know that the frame is referenced by the ``car`` of the
first pair in the environment, that's the suspect reference. But in a
more complex situation this might not yet be clear. In such a
situation it can be useful to look at the sequence of events leading
up to the detection of the error. See :ref:`topic-telemetry`.


.. index::
   single: bug; allocating with wrong size

.. _guide-debug-size:

Example: allocating with wrong size
-----------------------------------

Here's another kind of mistake: an off-by-one error in ``make_string``
leading to the allocation of string objects with the wrong size:

.. code-block:: c
    :emphasize-lines: 5

    static obj_t make_string(size_t length, char *string)
    {
      obj_t obj;
      mps_addr_t addr;
      size_t size = ALIGN(offsetof(string_s, string) + length/* oops, forgot: +1 */);
      do {
        mps_res_t res = mps_reserve(&addr, obj_ap, size);
        if (res != MPS_RES_OK) error("out of memory in make_string");
        obj = addr;
        obj->string.type = TYPE_STRING;
        obj->string.length = length;
        if (string) memcpy(obj->string.string, string, length+1);
        else memset(obj->string.string, 0, length+1);
      } while(!mps_commit(obj_ap, addr, size));
      total += size;
      return obj;
    }

Here's a test case that exercises this bug:

.. code-block:: scheme

    (define (church n f a) (if (eqv? n 0) a (church (- n 1) f (f a))))
    (church 1000 (lambda (s) (string-append s "x")) "")

And here's how it shows up in the debugger:

What happened to it? It's often helpful in these situations to have a
look at nearby memory. ::

    (gdb) x/20g obj

You can see that this is a block containing mostly pairs (which have
tag 0 and consist of three words), though you can see an operator
(with tag 4) near the bottom. But what's that at the start of the
block, where ``obj``\'s tag should be? It looks like a pointer. So
what's in the memory just below ``obj``? Let's look at the previous
few words::

    (gdb) x/10g (mps_word_t*)obj-8
    0x1003f9b48:        0x00000001003f9ae0      0x00000001003fb000
    0x1003f9b58:        0x0000000000000000      0x00000001003f9a80
    0x1003f9b68:        0x00000001003f9b80      0x0000000000000005
    0x1003f9b78:        0x0000000000000000      0x0000000000000000
    0x1003f9b88:        0x00000001003f9b70      0x00000001003fb000

Yes: there's a pair (with tag 0) at ``0x1003f9b80``. So it looks as
though the previous object was allocated with one size, but skipped
with a different size. The previous object being the string (with tag
5) at ``0x1003f9b70`` which has length 0 and so is three words long as
far as ``obj_skip`` is concerned::

    (gdb) print obj_skip(0x1003f9b70)
    $2 = (mps_addr_t) 0x1003f9b88

but the next object (the pair) was clearly allocated at
``0x1003f9b80`` (overwriting the last word of the string), so the
string must have been allocated with a size of only two words. This
should be enough evidence to track down the cause.
