Debugging with the Memory Pool System
=====================================

Memory management errors are some of the most stubborn and difficult
to track down, because the effect so often appears at a distant point
in the program that is seemingly unrelated to the cause, and by the
time the error is revealed, the information needed to reconstruct the
cause has long vanished. Immediately after an :term:`overwriting
error`, the block that overran its bounds is fine, and the block that
was overwritten may not be visited for a long time. A failure to
:term:`fix` a :term:`reference` does not necessarily cause the object
pointed to by the missed reference to die immediately: there may be
other references to that object, or a garbage collection may be
delayed. And even if it does die, the space it occupies may not be
re-allocated for some time.


General debugging advice
------------------------

1. Compile with debugging information turned on (``-g`` on the GCC or
   Clang command line).

2. Build the :term:`cool` :term:`variety` of the MPS (by defining the
   preprocessor constant ``CONFIG_VAR_COOL``, for example by setting
   ``-DCONFIG_VAR_COOL`` on the GCC or Clang command line). This
   variety contains many internal consistency checks (including such
   checks on the :term:`critical path`, which make it too slow for
   use in production), and can generate debugging output in the form
   of the :term:`telemetry stream`, discussed below.

3. Prepare a reproducible test case if possible. The MPS may be
   :term:`asynchronous <asynchronous garbage collector>`, but it is
   deterministic, so in single-threaded applications you should be
   able to get consistent results. (But you need to beware of `address
   space layout randomization`_: if you perform computation based on
   the addresses of objects, for example, hashing objects by their
   address, then ASLR will cause your hash tables to be laid out
   differently on each run, which may effect the order of memory
   management operations.)

    .. _address space layout randomization: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Address_space_layout_randomization

   A fact that assists with reproducibility is that the more frequently
   the collector runs, the sooner and more reliably errors are
   discovered. So if you have a bug that's hard to reproduce, you may
   be able to provoke it more reliably by having a mode for testing in
   which you run frequent collections (by calling
   :c:func:`mps_arena_collect` followed by
   :c:func:`mps_arena_release`), perhaps as frequently as every
   allocation.

4. Run your test case inside the debugger. Use ``assert`` and
   ``abort`` in your error handler (rather than ``exit``) so that you
   can enter the debugger with the contents of the control stack
   available for inspection.

   You may need to make sure that the debugger isn't entered on
   :term:`barrier (1)` hits (because the MPS uses barriers to protect
   parts of memory). In GDB, use these commands::

        (gdb) set dont-handle-bad-access 1
        (gdb) handle SIGBUS nostop

   Add them to your ``.gdbinit`` if appropriate.


.. _guide-debug-underscanning:

Example: underscanning
----------------------

An easy mistake to make is to omit to :term:`fix` a :term:`reference`
when :term:`scanning <scan>` a :term:`formatted object`. For example,
in the Scheme intrepreter's :ref:`scan method <guide-lang-scan>`, I
might have forgetten to fix the first element of a pair:

.. code-block:: c
   :emphasize-lines: 2

    case TYPE_PAIR:
      /* oops, forgot: FIX(obj->pair.car); */
      FIX(obj->pair.cdr);
      base = (char *)base + ALIGN(sizeof(pair_s));
      break;

This means that as far as the MPS is concerned, the first element of
the pair is :term:`unreachable` and so :term:`dead`, so after
collecting the region of memory containing this object, the space will
be reused for other objects. So the pointer ``obj->pair.car`` might
end up pointing to the start of a valid object (but the wrong one), or
to the middle of a valid object, or to an unused region of memory, or
into an MPS internal control structure.

The reproducible test case is simple. Run a garbage collection by
calling ``(gc)`` and then evaluate any expression::

    $ gdb ./scheme
    GNU gdb 6.3.50-20050815 (Apple version gdb-1820) (Sat Jun 16 02:40:11 UTC 2012)

    (gdb) run

    MPS Toy Scheme Example
    The prompt shows total allocated bytes and number of collections.
    Try (vector-length (make-vector 100000 1)) to see the MPS in action.
    You can force a complete garbage collection with (gc).
    If you recurse too much the interpreter may crash from using too much C stack.

    (gdb) print (char *)symbol->symbol.string
    $1 = 0x1003faf30 "foo"

The backtrace shows that the interpreter is in the middle of looking
up the symbol ``foo`` in the environment. The Scheme intrepreter
implements the environment as a list of *frames*, each of which is a
list of *bindings*, each binding being a pair of a symbol and its
value, as shown here:

    .. figure:: ../diagrams/scheme-env.svg
        :align: center
        :alt: Diagram: The environment data structure in the Scheme interpreter.

        The environment data structure in the Scheme interpreter.

In this case, because the evaluation is taking place at top level,
there is only one frame in the environment (the global frame). And
it's this frame that's corrupt::

    (gdb) frame 3
    #3  0x0000000100003f55 in lookup_in_frame (frame=0x1003fa7d0, symbol=0x1003faf20) at scheme.c:1065
    1065	    assert(TYPE(frame) == TYPE_PAIR);
    (gdb) print frame->type.type
    $2 = 13

The number 13 is the value ``TYPE_PAD``. So instead of the expected
pair, ``frame`` points to a :term:`padding object`.

You might guess at this point that the frame had not been fixed, and
since you know that the frame is referenced by the ``car`` of the
first pair in the environment, that's the suspect reference. But in a
more complex situation this might not yet be clear. In such a
situation it can be useful to look at the sequence of events leading
up to the detection of the error, and in order to enable you to do
that, the MPS provides its :ref:`topic-telemetry` feature.


.. _guide-debug-telemetry:

Telemetry
---------

In its :term:`cool` :term:`variety`, the MPS is capable of outputting
a configurable stream of events to assist with debugging and
profiling. The exact mechanism by which the telemetry stream is
controlled is in theory configurable via the :ref:`topic-plinth`, but
if you haven't done so then you can set the environment variables
:envvar:`MPS_TELEMETRY_CONTROL` and :envvar:`MPS_TELEMETRY_FILENAME`.
Setting the former to "``65535``" turns on all events, and the default
value for the latter is "``mpsio.log``" which is fine. So let's run
the test case with telemetry turned on::

    $ gdb ./scheme
    GNU gdb 6.3.50-20050815 (Apple version gdb-1820) (Sat Jun 16 02:40:11 UTC 2012)
    [...]
    (gdb) set environment MPS_TELEMETRY_CONTROL=65535
    (gdb) run
    Starting program: example/scheme/scheme 
    Reading symbols for shared libraries +............................. done
    MPS Toy Scheme Example
    [...]
    7944, 0> (gc)
    #[undefined]
    [...]
    7968, 1> foo
    Assertion failed: (TYPE(frame) == TYPE_PAIR), function lookup_in_frame, file scheme.c, line 1065.

    Program received signal SIGABRT, Aborted.
    0x00007fff91aeed46 in __kill ()

At this point there's still output in the MPS's internal event
buffers, which needs to be flushed. It would be a good idea to add a
call to :c:func:`mps_telemetry_flush` to the error handler, but for
now we can just call it directly from the debugger::

    (gdb) print mps_telemetry_flush()
    $1 = void

The MPS writes the telemetry to the log in an encoded form for speed.
It can be decoded using the :ref:`eventcnv <telemetry-eventcnv>`
program::

    (gdb) shell eventcnv -v | sort > mpsio.txt

The ``sort`` is useful because the events are not necessarily written
to the telemetry file in time order, but each event starts with a
timestamp so sorting makes a time series. The decoded events look like
this, with the timestamp in the first column (in units of
:c:type:`mps_clock_t`, typically 1 µs), the event type in the second
column, and then addresses or other data related to the event in the
remaining columns. All numbers are given in hexadecimal. ::

    00000C0DC0DA6A1D0F1 ArenaCreateVM  100129000   100000   100000

You can search through the telemetry for events related to particular
addresses of interest. Here we look for events related to the address
of the corrupted ``frame`` object::

    (gdb) frame 3
    #3  0x0000000100003f55 in lookup_in_frame (frame=0x1003fa7d0, symbol=0x1003faf20) at scheme.c:1065
    1065	    assert(TYPE(frame) == TYPE_PAIR);
    (gdb) print frame
    $2 = (obj_t) 0x1003fa7d0
    (gdb) shell grep -i 1003fa7d0 mpsio.txt || echo not found
    not found

There are no events related to this address, so in particular this
address was never fixed.


.. _guide-debug-size:

Example: allocating with wrong size
-----------------------------------

Here's another kind of mistake: an off-by-one error in ``make_string``
leading to the allocation of string objects with the wrong size:

.. code-block:: c
   :emphasize-lines: 5

    static obj_t make_string(size_t length, char *string)
    {
      obj_t obj;
      mps_addr_t addr;
      size_t size = ALIGN(offsetof(string_s, string) + length/* oops, forgot: +1 */);
      do {
        mps_res_t res = mps_reserve(&addr, obj_ap, size);
        if (res != MPS_RES_OK) error("out of memory in make_string");
        obj = addr;
        obj->string.type = TYPE_STRING;
        obj->string.length = length;
        if (string)
          memcpy(obj->string.string, string, length+1);
      } while(!mps_commit(obj_ap, addr, size));
      total += size;
      return obj;
    }

Here's a test case that exercises this bug:

.. code-block:: scheme

    (define (church n f a) (if (eqv? n 0) a (church (- n 1) f (f a))))
    (church 1000 (lambda (s) (string-append s "x")) "")

And here's how it shows up in the debugger::

    $ gdb ./scheme

The object being skipped is corrupt::

    (gdb) print obj->type.type
    $1 = 4168560

What happened to it? It's often helpful in these situations to have a
look at nearby memory. ::

    (gdb) x/20g obj

    0x1003f9c18:	0x000000010007b14a	0x0000000100005e30

You can see that this is a block containing mostly pairs (which have
tag 0 and consist of three words), though you can see an operator
(with tag 4) near the bottom. But what's that at the start of the
block, where ``obj``\'s tag should be? It looks like a pointer. So
what's in the memory just below ``obj``? Let's look at the previous
few words::

    (gdb) x/10g (mps_word_t*)obj-8
    0x1003f9b48:	0x00000001003f9ae0	0x00000001003fb000
    0x1003f9b58:	0x0000000000000000	0x00000001003f9a80
    0x1003f9b68:	0x00000001003f9b80	0x0000000000000005
    0x1003f9b78:	0x0000000000000000	0x0000000000000000
    0x1003f9b88:	0x00000001003f9b70	0x00000001003fb000

Yes: there's a pair (with tag 0) at ``0x1003f9b80``. So it looks as
though the previous object was allocated with one size, but skipped
with a different size. The previous object being the string (with tag
5) at ``0x1003f9b70`` which has length 0 and so is three words long as
far as ``obj_skip`` is concerned::

    (gdb) print obj_skip(0x1003f9b70)
    $2 = (mps_addr_t) 0x1003f9b88

but the next object (the pair) was clearly allocated at
``0x1003f9b80`` (overwriting the last word of the string), so the
string must have been allocated with a size of only two words.

This should be enough evidence to track down the cause.
