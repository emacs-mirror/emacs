TODO, QUERIES AND SUGGESTIONS

 3. Glossary entries need permalink markers. See
    <https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/sphinx/issue/996/expose-glossary-entry-link-on-hover>

 5. Fix the general index so that (1) aren't interpreted as
    subentries? (Or maybe it's OK as is?)

 7. Re-do the diagrams in vector form and using the colour palette.

 8. Use a better bibliography extension. See for example
    <http://wnielson.bitbucket.org/projects/sphinx-natbib/>

 9. Hyphenate long function names across line endings (but what if you
    copy them?)

11. Support MMREF-style anchors to the glossary (#garbage.collection
    instead of #garbage-collection).

27. Wouldn't it make mps_amc_apply easier to document if there were a
    typedef for the stepper function type, something like this?

    typedef void (*mps_amc_apply_stepper_t)(mps_addr_t object, void *p, size_t s)

    ANSWER: Richard says I can make this change since it's
    backwards-compatible.

32. You create a marker on the stack and pass it to
    mps_root_create_reg to tell it where the bottom of the stack is.
    Fine. But then you are supposed to call your program via
    mps_tramp. If the MPS is trampolining your whole program, why does
    the MPS need your help to work out where the stack is? It could
    work it out for itself surely?

    I guess this is some kind of separation of concerns -- mps_tramp
    is something to do with protection -- but it's hard for me to
    explain.

    ANSWER: mps_tramp is needed for your program to work on Windows.
    "mps_tramp needs to wrap any code that might handle references
    into a pool class that requires it." [All the ones with A.]

37. Some of the Scheme objects could be moved to a leaf-only pool
    (e.g. AMCZ) in an "advanced topics" section of the user guide.

38. Document about interface conventions and interface policies. What
    do we guarantee about support for the external symbols?

56. Deprecation warnings need nicer formatting. Also "since version
    1.111" is wrong: "starting with version 1.111" would be right.


DONE, ANSWERED

 1. Create a new domain
    <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/ext/appapi.html#sphinx.domains.Domain>

 2. Create new types of Sphinx objects for pools and topics.

    ACTION: doesn't seem necessary. Ordinary cross-references work fine.

 4. Make (1), (2) etc into superscripts

 6. Identify :term: references that point to "see" cross-references.

10. Pluralize "Topic" to "Topics" and so on.

12. Superscripts in aka sections.

13. Does the object format description (mps_fmt_A_s etc) have to be
    static as in the Scheme example? Or is it OK to throw it away
    after calling mps_fmt_create?

    Same question for the generation structure (mps_gen_param_s) for a
    pool and the size classes (mps_sac_class_s) for a segregated
    allocation cache?

    ANSWER: examination of the code shows that all of these structure
    are copied into internally allocated MPS control structures, and
    so it is OK for the client program to put these structures on the
    stack otherwise dispose of them.

14. What is the difference, if any, between mps_word_t and MPS_T_WORD?

    ANSWER: MPS_T_WORD comes from mpstd.h which contains no C code
    (only macro definitions). It used to be the case that mpstd.h was
    included in mps.h but it isn't any more? There's something to do
    here: why don't we include it? Because mpstd.h is a bit picky and
    could easily be broken. MPS_T_WORD could be eliminated from the
    external interface. Make a job?

    ACTION: made <https://info.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/issue/job003315/>

15. How can I explain why the Scheme example uses sizeof(mps_word_t)
    as its alignment? Why not MPS_PF_ALIGN (or are client programs not
    supposed to look at mpstd.h)? Why not something of its own
    manufacture, like sizeof(union {long, size_t, void*})?

    ANSWER: This a puzzle! More thought needed. Make a job?

    ACTION: made <https://info.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/issue/job003316/>

16. Why does the Scheme example have a copy method in its object
    format when the reference manual says it's obsolete?

    ANSWER: It wasn't obsolete when it was written. I removed it.

17. What is the difference between the "event stream" and the
    "telemetry stream"? Are these names for the same thing? Or is
    there a distinction (for example, "event stream" refers to the
    internal, unfiltered, stream of events and "telemetry stream"
    refers to the filtered stream)?

    ANSWER: the event stream is the implementation of the telemetry
    stream, so the user doc can refer to "telemetry stream".

18. The location dependency functions all take an arena as an
    argument. What is the role of this argument?

    ANSWER: if you have multiple arenas, you are going to have to have
    an ld_t for each arena, and add each address you are interested in
    for each arena. (If you happen to know which arena it's in, you
    can just specify it for that arena.) So for isstale, it better be
    the same arena as add.

19. What is the role of the third (addr) argument to mps_ld_isstale?
    LDIsStale says "UNUSED(addr);" so maybe it is unused.

    ANSWER: in theory it's the address you want to check, but in the
    implementation it tells you for all addresses. The LD functions
    have an intention that is not quite the same as the design
    documentation. (But what, asks RB, is the point of ld_add?)
    Perhaps in the case of isstale it's "a piece of information that
    might be useful for debugging".

20. Is the material in the pool class comparison table at all accurate?

    ANSWER: It will be better to have a flowchart approach rather than
    a table of properties.

21. This code seems a bit confused about what to do:

        assert(0);
        fprintf(stderr, "Unexpected object on the heap\n");
        abort();
        return MPS_RES_FAIL;

    What should it say?

    ANSWER: the assertion and the return seem to be bogus, so I
    removed them.

22. How does fixing interact with tagged references? Do I need to
    remove the tag before fixing a reference? Do I need to restore the
    tag afterwards? I thought that both would be necessary but the
    critical path documentation has an example from OpenDylan with
    tagged references that does neither:
    <https://info.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/master/design/critical-path.txt>

    ANSWER: we'll document that all references need to be
    decrypted/de-tagged. There ought to be some slack in practice but
    it needs thought. Make a job.

    ACTION: made <https://info.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/issue/job003317/>

23. This code from mps_chat in the Scheme example is wrong:

        if (type == mps_message_type_gc_start()) {
          printf("Collection %lu started.\n", (unsigned long)mps_collections(arena));

    mps_collections returns the total number of collections to date,
    not the number of the collection that posted the message. This
    means that if there have been multiple collections since the last
    time the message queue was emptied, the output will look like

        Collection 47 started.
          ...
        Collection 47 started.
          ...
        Collection 47 started.
          ...

    ANSWER: mis-feature. Update the scheme example. Make a job.

    ACTION: updated the Scheme example.

    ACTION: made <https://info.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/issue/job003318/>

24. It seems "tricky" to re-use fowarding objects as padding objects
    by setting their forwarding pointer to NULL. Wouldn't it be
    simpler to explain if we had TYPE_PAD for multiple-word padding
    objects? Things are difficult enough to explain as it is!

    ANSWER: It would be simpler, so I made this change.

25. The Scheme example says, "Adapting it to use the MPS took
    approximately two hours". I doubt this would be the common case,
    and it would be better to under-promise here and over-deliver.

    ANSWER: take it out.

26. I need to document the values in mps_gen_param_s. I believe they
    are the capacity (size of the generation in kilobytes) and the
    mortality (the proportion of objects in this generation that are
    expected to die in a collection). But what do they mean to the
    MPS? And how should one go about choosing values?

    ANSWER: requires a whole document. Talk to RB. The intro document
    should say, "take these values on trust". There's a design
    document about this based on the Lisp Machine:
    analysis.strategy.lisp-machine or something.

28. Wouldn't the Scheme example be better without TAB characters?

    ANSWER: maybe, but it would lead to merge conflicts. So no change.

29. The example code looks better (easier to see the structure) if I
    use an indentation of four spaces. There are also cases where the
    original code is inconsistent (compare the indentation of the case
    labels in "print" versus "obj_scan"). I've made these consistent
    in the user guide.

    Should these changes be propagated back to the example code?

    ANSWER: no.

30. The Scheme example is inconsistent in its use of whitespace: for
    example sometimes there's a space after "if" and sometimes not.

    ANSWER: maybe so, but it would lead to merge conflicts. So no
    change.

31. What is a root mode and how do I explain it?

    ANSWER: currently a root mode has no effect. It tells the MPS
    whether it's OK for the MPS to put a barrier on the
    root. Recommend pass zero. For future expansion.

33. Status. At what point will the work be "good enough" to merge back
    to the master sources?

    ANSWER: After RB reviews it.

34. The generic example of using mps_tramp need to pass argv and argc,
    and return an exit code, so maybe it would make sense to do that
    in the Scheme example, even though Scheme doesn't use these
    parameters.

    ANSWER: no.

35. There's a lot of stuff to explain here, and I think some of it
    could be simplified:

    a. The common trampoline case (passing argv and argc, and
       returning an exit code).

    b. The common single-thread root registration case (e.g. putting a
       marker on the stack in mps_tramp).

    ANSWER: leave it as it is.

36. The discussion in the Scheme example about mps_reserve suggests
    that mps_alloc doesn't require aligned sizes. Is that right? Needs
    to be added to mps_alloc reference if so.

    ANSWER: in fact there's no rule about this. Depends on the pool
    class. "It doesn't unless the pool class says it does".

39. We don't support scanning the stack/registers except via
    mps_stack_scan_ambig? Document this?

    ANSWER: this is the only one we support at the moment.

40. The fragmentation_limit argument to mps_class_mvt is an integer
    representing a percentage between 1 and 100. For consistency with
    mps_gen_param_s this should be a double between 0 (exclusive) and
    1. Can we change this?

    ANSWER: make a job.

    ACTION: made <https://info.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/issue/job003319/>

41. Move symbol reference from mpsio.h, mpstd.h and mpslib.h to the
    plinth topic document.

    ACTION: done.

42. Move symbol references for the pool classes to the corresponding
    pool document.

43. In the "choosing a pool" procedure there's no mention of ambiguous
    references. I omitted them because the NB/RIT chart of pool
    properties seemed to suggest that no pools can contain ambiguous
    references. But is this right? Couldn't you allocate your block
    containing ambiguous references in a non-moving, non-scanning pool
    like MVT and register it as an ambiguous root?

    ANSWER: Ought to be a note to explain that there may more thing to
    take into account for experts. "For beginners". Ambiguous
    references not currently supported via scanning/automatic pools
    etc: use workaround.

44. In the "choosing a pool" procedure there's no mention of
    protection. Can we subsume this under "moving"?

    ANSWER: Use "movable and protectable".

45. Does mps_arena_step offer any guarantees about how long it will
    pause for? (I presume not: I've written "makes every effort to
    return within interval seconds, but does not guarantee to do so".)

    ANSWER: No guarantee. "Since it calls your scanning code..."

46. RHSK's documentation for mps_arena_step says "Note that
    mps_arena_step will still step, even if the arena has been
    clamped. This is to allow a client to advance a collection only at
    these mps_arena_step points (but note that barrier hits will also
    cause collection work)." However, looking at the implementation,
    it seems to me that if mps_arena_step does anything, then it
    releases the arena. Is the client program expected to call
    mps_arena_clamp after mps_arena_step returns, if they want to
    support this use case?

    Similar question if the arena is in the parked state.

    ANSWER: this is a bug. Create a job for both cases. (optional)

47. How does mps_arena_start_collect interact with the arena state?
    (It seems from looking at the implementation that it puts the
    arena into the unclamped state, like mps_arena_release.)

    ANSWER: this is fine.

48. How do I explain the condition on mps_addr_pool and mps_addr_fmt?
    It's clear what this is if the address is the address of an
    allocated block? But do we guarantee anything if it isn't? The
    implementation succeeds if the address points anywhere within a
    page allocated to a pool.

    ANSWER: not undefined, might get false positive. Never false
    negative.

49. Constraints on order of _destroy functions. Is it an error to
    destroy an object format while there are still pools that refer to
    it?

    ANSWER: yes.

50. mps.h declares the type mps_shift_t for a "shift amount" but this
    is not used anywhere in the MPS. Remove?

    ACTION: removed in change 179944.

51. The structures mps_sac_s and mps_sac_freelist_block_s are declared
    in mps.h. I presume that this is so for the benefit of the macros
    MPS_SAC_ALLOC_FAST and MPS_SAC_FREE_FAST, and the details of these
    structues are not actually part of the public interface.

    ANSWER: RB thinks the client doesn't need to know about these
    structures, so they ought to have names starting with
    underscores. Create a job.

52. mps_fmt_fixed_s is just like mps_fmt_A_s but with no "skip". I
    presume it's for fixed-size pools. But the only fixed-size pool is
    MFS, which has no public header, so I presume it's for MPS
    internal use only. What should I say about this?

    ANSWER: leave it undocumented. Maybe it (and mps_fmt_create_fixed)
    should be removed? Make a job.

53. It's rather unfortunate that mps_arena_create take arguments
    (size, base) but mps_arena_extend takes (base, size). I guess
    there's nothing to be done about this now.

    ANSWER: RB plans to remove mps_arena_create and replace
    them. Create a job.

54. Need notes about performance. It's important to know that
    mps_addr_pool is really quick and it's fine to call it. But other
    things are slow, e.g. walking over all objects.

    ACTION: create a job.

55. Mark all the allocation frame stuff as deprecated in the manual.

    ACTION: I marked them all as deprecated in version 1.111.
