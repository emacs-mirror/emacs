TODO

2. Create new types of objects for pools and topics.

3. Glossary entries need permalinks. See
<https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/sphinx/issue/996/expose-glossary-entry-link-on-hover>

5. Fix the general index so that (1) aren't interpreted as subentries.

7. Re-do the diagrams in vector form and using the colour palette.

8. Use a better bibliography extension. See for example
   <http://wnielson.bitbucket.org/projects/sphinx-natbib/>

9. Hyphenate long function names across line endings (but what if you
   copy them?)

11. Support MMREF-style anchors to the glossary (#garbage.collection
    instead of #garbage-collection).


QUERIES

1. Does the object format description (struct mps_fmt_A_s) have to be
   static?

2. What is the difference, if any, between mps_word_t and MPS_T_WORD?

3. How can I explain why the Scheme example uses sizeof(mps_word_t) as
   its alignment? Why not MPS_PF_ALIGN? Why not something of its own
   manufacture, like sizeof(union {long, size_t, void*})?

4. Why does the Scheme example have a copy method in its object format
   when the reference manual says it's obsolete? Can I remove it?


DONE

1. Create a new domain
   <http://sphinx.pocoo.org/ext/appapi.html#sphinx.domains.Domain>

4. Make (1), (2) etc into superscripts

6. Identify :term: references that point to "see" cross-references.

10. Pluralize "Topic" to "Topics" and so on.
