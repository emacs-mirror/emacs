Scanning
========


Give FIX1 any word
It's not an error to give it a bogus value
It tells you quickly whether it's worth passing to MPS_FIX2 or not
BUT if it's not a genuine pointer you mustn't pass it to FIX2

"The pointer you pass to FIX1 can be anywhere within the allocated block."

Note: this allows you to use the bottom bits for tagging
Or pass interior pointers to FIX1

When you pass the pointer to FIX2, it has to be a genuine pointer, i.e. a client pointer (i.e. base pointer except for auto_header) and it has to be interesting.

FIX1 is a very cheap test: if you are using interior pointers or tagged pointers it almost certainly worth applying before you remove the tag.


Critical path
If you're really trying to speed this up
FIX1 and FIX2 might be worth splitting up even if doing nothing
Look at the assembler
Experiment
e.g. if you have lots of unboxed objects, best to check this before FIX1


Segregate objects into pools with different scanners
Promise that FIX1 doesn't modify anything.

From the documentation for mps_fix:


Returned Values

If the :term:`rank` of the object being scanned is not :c:macro:`MPS_RANK_AMBIG` then the reference pointed to by *ref_io* may be modified by :c:func:`mps_fix`.


Description

This function is the part of the scanning protocol used to indicate references. Scanning functions apply it, or :c:func:`MPS_FIX12`, or :c:func:`MPS_FIX1` and :c:func:`MPS_FIX2` the references in the object being scanned.

It may only be called from within a scanning function. If it is called within a :c:func:`MPS_SCAN_BEGIN` block, :c:func:`MPS_FIX_CALL` must be used (yes, really).

This function does not perform any particular operation. The MPS may call scanning functions for a number of reasons, and :c:func:`mps_fix` may take different actions depending on those reasons.

::

    mps_res_t scan_array(mps_ss_t ss, mps_addr_t object, size_t length)
    {
        size_t i;
        mps_res_t res;
        mps_addr_t *array = (mps_addr_t *)object;

        for (i = 0; i < length; ++i) {
            res = mps_fix(ss, &array[i]);
            if (res != MPS_RES_OK)
                return res;
        }

        return res;
    }


Error Handling

The function returns :c:macro:`MPS_RES_OK` if it was successful, in which case the scanning function should continue to scan the rest of the object, applying :c:func:`mps_fix` to the remaining references. If :c:func:`mps_fix` returns a value other than :c:macro:`MPS_RES_OK`, the scanning function must return that value, and may return without scanning further references. Generally, it is better if it returns as soon as possible.

Error Handling

The macro returns :c:macro:`MPS_RES_OK` if it was successful, in which case the scanning function should continue to scan the rest of the object, fixing the remaining references. If :c:func:`MPS_FIX12` returns a value other than :c:macro:`MPS_RES_OK`, the scanning function must return that value, and may return without scanning further references. Generally, it is better if it returns as soon as possible.

Fixing references
-----------------

.. c:function:: mps_res_t mps_fix(mps_ss_t ss, mps_addr_t *ref_io)

    Tell the MPS about a :term:`reference`, and possibly update it.
    This function must only be called from within a :term:`scan
    method`.

    ``ss`` is the :term:`scan state` that was passed to the scan method.

    ``ref_io`` points to the reference.

    Returns :c:macro:`MPS_RES_OK` if successful: in this case the
    reference may have been updated, and the scan method must continue
    to scan the :term:`block`. If it returns any other result, the
    scan method must return that result as soon as possible, without
    fixing any further references.

    .. deprecated:: 1.110

        Use :c:func:`MPS_SCAN_BEGIN`, :c:func:`MPS_FIX12` (or
        :c:func:`MPS_FIX1` and :c:func:`MPS_FIX2`), and
        :c:func:`MPS_SCAN_END` instead.

    .. note::

        If your reference is :term:`tagged <tagged reference>`, you
        must remove the tag before calling :c:func:`mps_fix`, and
        restore the tag to the (possibly updated) reference
        afterwards. (There is an exception for references to objects
        belonging to a format of variant auto_header: these references
        must not subtract the header size.)

        If you want to call this between :c:func:`MPS_SCAN_BEGIN` and
        :c:func:`MPS_SCAN_END`, you must use :c:func:`MPS_FIX_CALL`
        to ensure that the scan state is passed correctly.


.. c:function:: mps_bool_t MPS_FIX1(mps_ss_t ss, mps_addr_t ref)

    Tell the MPS about a :term:`reference`. This macro must only be
    used within a :term:`scan method`, between
    :c:func:`MPS_SCAN_BEGIN` and :c:func:`MPS_SCAN_END`.

    ``ss`` is the :term:`scan state` that was passed to the scan method.

    ``ref`` is the reference.

    Returns a truth value (:c:type:`mps_bool_t`) indicating whether
    the reference is likely to be interesting to the MPS. If it
    returns false, the scan method must continue scanning the
    :term:`block`. If it returns true, the scan method must invoke
    :c:func:`MPS_FIX2`, to fix the reference.

    .. note::

        If your reference is :term:`tagged <tagged reference>`, you
        must remove the tag before calling :c:func:`MPS_FIX1`.

    .. note::

        In the common case where the scan method does not need to do
        anything between :c:func:`MPS_FIX1` and :c:func:`MPS_FIX2`,
        you can use the convenience macro :c:func:`MPS_FIX12`.


.. c:function:: MPS_FIX12(mps_ss_t ss, mps_addr_t *ref_io)

    Tell the MPS about a :term:`reference`, and possibly update it.
    This macro must only be used within a :term:`scan method`, between
    :c:func:`MPS_SCAN_BEGIN` and :c:func:`MPS_SCAN_END`.

    ``ss`` is the :term:`scan state` that was passed to the scan method.

    ``ref_io`` points to the reference.

    Returns :c:macro:`MPS_RES_OK` if successful: in this case the
    reference may have been updated, and the scan method must continue
    to scan the :term:`block`. If it returns any other result, the
    scan method must return that result as soon as possible, without
    fixing any further references.

    .. note::

        If your reference is :term:`tagged <tagged reference>`, you
        must remove the tag before calling :c:func:`MPS_FIX2`, and
        restore the tag to the (possibly updated) reference
        afterwards. (There is an exception for references to objects
        belonging to a format of variant auto_header: these references
        must not subtract the header size.)

    .. note::

        The macro :c:func:`MPS_FIX12` is a convenience for the common
        case where :c:func:`MPS_FIX1` is immediately followed by
        :c:func:`MPS_FIX2`.


.. c:function:: MPS_FIX2(mps_ss_t ss, mps_addr_t *ref_io)

    Tell the MPS about a :term:`reference`, and possibly update it.
    This macro must only be used within a :term:`scan method`,
    between :c:func:`MPS_SCAN_BEGIN` and :c:func:`MPS_SCAN_END`.

    ``ss`` is the :term:`scan state` that was passed to the scan method.

    ``ref_io`` points to the reference.

    Returns :c:macro:`MPS_RES_OK` if successful: in this case the
    reference may have been updated, and the scan method must continue
    to scan the :term:`block`. If it returns any other result, the
    scan method must return that result as soon as possible, without
    fixing any further references.

    .. note::

        If your reference is :term:`tagged <tagged reference>`, you
        must remove the tag before calling :c:func:`MPS_FIX2`, and
        restore the tag to the (possibly updated) reference
        afterwards. (There is an exception for references to objects
        belonging to a format of variant auto_header: these references
        must not subtract the header size.)

    .. note::

        In the common case where the scan method does not need to do
        anything between :c:func:`MPS_FIX1` and :c:func:`MPS_FIX2`,
        you can use the convenience macro :c:func:`MPS_FIX12`.



Scan states
-----------

.. c:type:: mps_ss_t

    The type of :term:`scan states <scan state>`.

    A scan state represents the state of the current :term:`scan`. The
    MPS passes a scan state to the :term:`scan method` of an
    :term:`object format` when it needs to :term:`scan` for
    :term:`references <reference>` within a region of memory. The scan
    method must pass the scan state to :c:func:`MPS_SCAN_BEGIN` and
    :c:func:`MPS_SCAN_END` to delimit a sequence of fix operations,
    and to the functions :c:func:`MPS_FIX1`, :c:func:`MPS_FIX2` and
    :c:func:`MPS_FIX12` when fixing a :term:`reference`.


.. c:function:: MPS_SCAN_BEGIN(mps_ss_t ss)

    Within a :term:`scan method`, set up local information required
    by :c:func:`MPS_FIX1`, :c:func:`MPS_FIX2` and
    :c:func:`MPS_FIX12`. The local information persists until
    :c:func:`MPS_SCAN_END`.

    ``ss`` is the :term:`scan state` that was passed to the scan method.

    .. note::

        Between :c:func:`MPS_SCAN_BEGIN` and :c:func:`MPS_SCAN_END`,
        the scan state is in a special state, and must not be passed
        to a function. If you really need to do so, for example
        because you have an embedded structure shared between two scan
        methods, you must wrap the call with :c:func:`MPS_FIX_CALL` to
        ensure that the scan state is passed correctly.


.. c:function:: MPS_SCAN_END(mps_ss_t ss)

    Within a :term:`scan method`, terminate a block started by
    :c:func:`MPS_SCAN_BEGIN`.

    ``ss`` is the :term:`scan state` that was passed to the scan
    method.

    .. note::

        :c:func:`MPS_SCAN_END` ensures that the scan is completed, so
        successful termination of a scan must invoke it. However, in
        case of an error it is allowed to return from the scan
        method without invoking :c:func:`MPS_SCAN_END`.

    .. note::

        Between :c:func:`MPS_SCAN_BEGIN` and :c:func:`MPS_SCAN_END`, the
        scan state is in a special state, and must not be passed to a
        function. If you really need to do so, for example because you
        have an embedded structure shared between two scan methods, you
        must wrap the call with :c:func:`MPS_FIX_CALL` to ensure that the
        scan state is passed correctly.


.. c:function:: MPS_FIX_CALL(ss, call)

    Call a function from within a :term:`scan method`, between
    :c:func:`MPS_SCAN_BEGIN` and :c:func:`MPS_SCAN_END`, passing
    the :term:`scan state` correctly.

    ``ss`` is the scan state that was passed to the scan method.

    ``call`` is an expression containing a function call where ``ss``
    is one of the arguments.

    Returns the result of evaluating the expression ``call``.

    Between :c:func:`MPS_SCAN_BEGIN` and :c:func:`MPS_SCAN_END`, the
    scan state is in a special state, and must not be passed to a
    function. If you really need to do so, for example because you
    have a structure shared between two :term:`object formats <object
    format>`, you must wrap the call with :c:func:`MPS_FIX_CALL` to
    ensure that the scan state is passed correctly.

    In example below, the scan method ``obj_scan`` fixes the object's
    ``left`` and ``right`` references, but delegates the scanning of
    references inside the object's ``data`` member to the function
    ``data_scan``. In order to ensure that the scan state is passed
    correctly to ``data_scan``, the call must be wrapped in
    :c:func:`MPS_FIX_CALL`. ::

        mps_res_t obj_scan(mps_ss_t ss, mps_addr_t base, mps_addr_t limit)
        {
            Object *obj;
            mps_res_t res;
            MPS_SCAN_BEGIN(ss) {
                for (obj = base; obj < limit; obj++) {
                    if (MPS_FIX12(ss, &obj->left) != MPS_RES_OK)
                        return res;
                    MPS_FIX_CALL(ss, res = data_scan(ss, &obj->data));
                    if (res != MPS_RES_OK)
                        return res;
                    if (MPS_FIX12(ss, &obj->right) != MPS_RES_OK)
                        return res;
                }
            } MPS_SCAN_END(ss);
            return MPS_RES_OK;
        }
