Platform codes
--------------

The MPS uses a six-character platform code to express a combination of
operating system, CPU architecture, and compiler toolchain. Each
six-character code breaks down into three pairs of characters:
``OSARCT``. The first two characters name the operating system:

======  ================  ====================
``OS``  Operating system  Constant
======  ================  ====================
``fr``  FreeBSD           :c:macro:`MPS_OS_FR`
``li``  Linux             :c:macro:`MPS_OS_LI`
``w3``  Windows           :c:macro:`MPS_OS_W3`
``xc``  OS X              :c:macro:`MPS_OS_XC`
======  ================  ====================

The second pair of characters name the processor architecture:

======  ======================  ======================
``AR``  Processor architecture  Constant
======  ======================  ======================
``i3``  Intel/AMD IA-32         :c:macro:`MPS_ARCH_I3`
``i6``  Intel/AMD x86-64        :c:macro:`MPS_ARCH_I6`
======  ======================  ======================

The third pair of characters name the compiler toolchain:

======  =======================  =======================
``CT``  Compiler toolchain       Constant
======  =======================  =======================
``gc``  GNU Compiler collection  :c:macro:`MPS_BUILD_GC`
``ll``  Clang/LLVM               :c:macro:`MPS_BUILD_LL`
``mv``  Microsoft Visual C/C++   :c:macro:`MPS_BUILD_MV`
======  =======================  =======================

In each case the aspect of the platform can be tested by checking
whether the preprocessor constant in the third column in the table
is defined, and the full platform can be tested by checking
whether the corresponding ``MPS_PF_`` preprocessor constant is
defined. For example, "``xci6ll``" platform corresponds to the
:c:macro:`MPS_PF_XCI6LL` preprocessor constant.

Not all combinations of operating system, processor architecture,
and compiler are supported.
