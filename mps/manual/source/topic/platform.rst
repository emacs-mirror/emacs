    A :term:`C` preprocessor macro that indicates, if defined, that
    the :term:`platform` consists of the Linux operating system, the
    x86-64 processor architecture, and the GCC compiler.


.. c:macro:: MPS_PF_STRING

    A :term:`C` preprocessor macro that names the :term:`platform` for
    which the MPS was built.

    It expands to a string "``abcdef``" consisting of six characters
    that are digits or lower-case letters. The first two characters
    name the operating system:

    ======  ================  ====================
    ``ab``  Operating system  Constant
    ======  ================  ====================
    ``fr``  FreeBSD           :c:macro:`MPS_OS_FR`
    ------  ----------------  --------------------
    ``li``  Linux             :c:macro:`MPS_OS_LI`
    ------  ----------------  --------------------
    ``w3``  Windows           :c:macro:`MPS_OS_W3`
    ------  ----------------  --------------------
    ``xc``  OS X              :c:macro:`MPS_OS_XC`
    ======  ================  ====================

    The second pair of characters name the processor architecture:

    ======  ======================  ======================
    ``cd``  Processor architecture  Constant
    ======  ======================  ======================
    ``i3``  Intel/AMD IA-32         :c:macro:`MPS_ARCH_I3`
    ------  ----------------------  ----------------------
    ``i6``  Intel/AMD x86-64        :c:macro:`MPS_ARCH_I6`
    ======  ======================  ======================

    The third pair of characters name the compiler:

    ======  ================  =======================
    ``ef``  Compiler          Constant
    ======  ================  =======================
    ``gc``  GCC               :c:macro:`MPS_BUILD_GC`
    ------  ----------------  -----------------------
    ``ll``  LLVM              :c:macro:`MPS_BUILD_LL`
    ------  ----------------  -----------------------
    ``mv``  Visual C/C++      :c:macro:`MPS_BUILD_MV`
    ======  ================  =======================

    In each case the aspect of the platform can be tested by checking
    whether the preprocessor constant in the third column in the table
    is defined, and the full platform can be tested by checking
    whether the corresponding ``MPS_PF_`` preprocessor constant is
    defined. For example, "``xci6ll``" platform corresponds to the
    :c:macro:`MPS_PF_XCI6LL` preprocessor constant.

    Not all combinations of operating system, processor architecture,
    and compiler are supported.


.. c:macro:: MPS_PF_W3I3MV

    A :term:`C` preprocessor macro that indicates, if defined, that
    the :term:`platform` consists of the Windows operating system, the
    IA-32 processor architecture, and the Microsoft Visual C/C++
    compiler.


.. c:macro:: MPS_PF_W3I6MV

    A :term:`C` preprocessor macro that indicates, if defined, that
    the :term:`platform` consists of the Windows operating system, the
    x86-64 processor architecture, and the Microsoft Visual C/C++
    compiler.


.. c:macro:: MPS_PF_XCI3GC

    A :term:`C` preprocessor macro that indicates, if defined, that
    the :term:`platform` consists of the OS X operating system, the
    IA-32 processor architecture, and the GCC compiler.


.. c:macro:: MPS_PF_XCI3LL

    A :term:`C` preprocessor macro that indicates, if defined, that
    the :term:`platform` consists of the OS X operating system, the
    IA-32 processor architecture, and the LLVM compiler.


.. c:macro:: MPS_PF_XCI6LL

    A :term:`C` preprocessor macro that indicates, if defined, that
    the :term:`platform` consists of the OS X operating system, the
    x86-64 processor architecture, and the LLVM compiler.


.. c:type:: MPS_T_ULONGEST

    The largest unsigned integral type.

    The exact identity of this type is
    :term:`platform`\-dependent. Typical identities are ``unsigned
    long`` and ``unsigned __int_64``.


.. c:type:: MPS_T_WORD

    An unsigned integral type that is the same size as an
    :term:`object pointer`, so that ``sizeof(MPS_T_WORD) ==
    sizeof(void*)``.

    The exact identity of this type is
    :term:`platform`\-dependent. Typical identities are ``unsigned
    long`` and ``unsigned __int_64``.


.. c:macro:: MPS_WORD_SHIFT

    The logarithm to base 2 of the constant :c:macro:`MPS_WORD_WIDTH`,
    so that ``1 << MPS_WORD_SHIFT == MPS_WORD_WIDTH``.

    The value is platform-dependent. Typical values are 5 and 6.


.. c:macro:: MPS_WORD_WIDTH

    The width in bits of the type :c:type:`MPS_T_WORD`, so that
    ``MPS_WORD_WIDTH == sizeof(MPS_T_WORD) * CHAR_BIT``.

    This value is platform-dependent. It is always a power of 2:
    typical values are 32 and 64.
