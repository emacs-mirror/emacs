Most of it was originally written by memory management experts in the
Adaptive Memory Management Group at `Harlequin Limited
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlequin_(software_company)>`_:

* Nick Barnes
* Richard Brooksby
* David Jones
* Tony Mann
* Gavin Matthews
* Pekka P. Pirinen

* P. T. Withington

The Adaptive Memory Management Group no longer exists, and Harlequin
has become a part of `Global Graphics
<http://www.globalgraphics.com/>`_. However, most of the group's work
has been aquired by `Ravenbrook Limited`, whose directors are Richard
Brooksby, the group's chief architect and manager, and Nick Barnes, a
senior group member.

The award-winning web presentation was designed by its first editor,
Gavin Matthews.

Particular thanks go to Richard Jones for his enormously useful book
[JONES96]_, and for his comments on the Reference.
