Most of it was originally written by memory management experts in the
Adaptive Memory Management Group at `Harlequin Limited
<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlequin_(software_company)>`_:

* Nick Barnes
* Richard Brooksby
* David Jones
* David Lovemore
* Tony Mann
* Gavin Matthews
* Pekka P. Pirinen
* Richard Tucker
* P.Â T. Withington

Gavin Matthews was the original editor of the Memory Management
Reference.

The Adaptive Memory Management Group no longer exists, and Harlequin
has become a part of `Global Graphics
<http://www.globalgraphics.com/>`_. However, most of the group's work
has been aquired by `Ravenbrook Limited`_, whose directors are Richard
Brooksby, the group's chief architect and manager, and Nick Barnes, a
senior group member.

Particular thanks go to Richard Jones for his enormously useful book
:ref:`The Garbage Collection Handbook <JONES12>`, and for his comments
on the Reference.

Many people have :ref:`made valuable suggestions <contact>` for the
Reference and contributed glossary entries. We are grateful for the
