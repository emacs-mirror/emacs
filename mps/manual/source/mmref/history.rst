A brief history of memory management
====================================

1801

    First :term:`memory (1)` device invented by Joseph-Marie Jaquard,
    in the form of perforated cards for a programmable loom.

1833–

    Charles Babbage designs his Analytical Engine, a steam-powered,
    general-purpose, mechanical computer with brass gears as internal
    memory and punched cards for input. The design is never
    constructed.

1884

    Herman Hollerith applies for a patent for his punched-card
    machines.

1938

    Konrad Zuse constructs an electromechanical computer in Germany.

1943

    Colossus, a vacuum-tube device for breaking codes at Bletchley
    Park in Britain, becomes the first all-electronic calculating
    device. It uses paper tape for input with optical readers.

1947–48

    Magnetic drums are introduced.

1949

    EDSAC started up at Cambridge University in Britain. This is the
    first Von Neumann or "stored-program" machine, where the
    instructions are stored in the same type of memory as data.

1949

    First tests of magnetic disks.

1952

    RCA Bizmac produced with iron-:term:`core` memory and a magnetic
    drum.

1953

    The first magnetic tape drive produced.

    IBM 650 produced, the first mass-produced drum-memory machine.

1957

    First :term:`Fortran` compiler delivered, with :term:`static
    allocation` only.

    Disk memory produced, for the IBM305 RAMAC.

1958

    :term:`Heap allocation`, :term:`garbage collection` and
    :term:`Lisp` invented by John McCarthy [MCCARTHY60]_.

    :term:`Algol`, the first block-structured language, appears,
    providing :term:`stack allocation`.

1961

    Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS) available, the first system
    with :term:`paging`.

1962

    Atlas available, the first computer with :term:`virtual memory`.

1965

    Maurice Wilkes and Gordon Scarott propose the use of :term:`cache
    memory`.

1967

    :term:`Simula` becomes the first object-oriented language.

1969

    Intel announce a 1 kilobit :term:`RAM` chip.

1970

    Intel produce the 1103, the first generally available
    :term:`DRAM`.

1970

    :term:`Prolog` invented by Alain Colmerauer.

1971

    IBM produce the 8-inch floppy disk.

    Intel produce the 1701 erasable :term:`ROM`.

    Intel 4004 produced, the first commercially available
    microprocessor.

1972

    :term:`C` designed by Dennis Ritchie.

    5¼-inch floppy disks appear.

1974

    Intel produce the 8080 microprocessor, which can access 64 kB of
    memory.

1975

    :term:`Tri-color marking` invented by Edsger W. Dijkstra and
    others, the first :term:`incremental garbage collection`
    algorithm. [DLMSS76]_.

1979

    First digital video disks from Sony and Philips.

1980

    Winchester hard drive produced by Alan Shugart, the first large
    storage device for PCs.

1981

    IBM decides that no PC user will ever need more that 640 kB of
    memory.

1983

    :term:`Generational garbage collection` developed by Lieberman and
    Hewitt [LH83]_.

1984

    :term:`Generational garbage collection` used for :term:`Smalltalk`
    by Dave Ungar [UNGAR84]_.

1991

    :term:`Scheme` standardized; first garbage-collected language with
    an international standard.

1995

    :term:`Java` announced by a team of Sun engineers led by James
    Gosling.

2002

    New :term:`COBOL` standard includes garbage collection.
