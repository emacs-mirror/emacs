Old design
**********

.. warning::

    Much of the documentation in this section is very old: some of it
    dates back to the origin of the MPS in 1995. It has not been
    brought up to date or checked for correctness, so it is mainly of
    historical interest. As pieces of documentation are brought up to
    date, they will be moved to the main :ref:`design` section.
