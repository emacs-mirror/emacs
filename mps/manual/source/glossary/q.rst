    quadword

        A *quadword* is a unit of memory consisting of four adjacent :term:`words <word>`.

        In digital's Alpha architecture, a quadword for 64 bits is actually the *natural word size*, but the term *word* is still used for the 16-bit unit, for compatibility with PDP-11.

        .. seealso:: :term:`doubleword`, :term:`longword`.
