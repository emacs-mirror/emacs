<h2 id = "int">Introduction</h2>

<p>
This document contains build notes for the Memory Pool System Kit.
</p>
<p>
The readership of this document is anyone who wants to build MPS
binaries from the sources.  Read the readme.txt file first.
</p>

<p>
This document is not complete; the MPS kit is buildable on many
platforms that are not mentioned in these notes.  The MPS kit is
easy to modify such that it builds on many more.
</p>
<p>
This document is not confidential.

<h2 id = "plasup">Platform support</h2>


<p>
The MPS has historically been built on many platforms that are either
now obsolete or to which we don't have convenient access.

</pre>
<p>
Platforms listed as "maintained" are used at Ravenbrook and the MPS
should work well on them.  OS X on PowerPC (xcppgc) is in decline as
Apple have moved to Intel architecture and are no longer shipping
PowerPC based systems.
</p>
<p>
Platforms are generally listed as "not maintained" if Ravenbrook
doesn't have access to a suitable machine.  Should you have access
to such a platform though, you should find that the MPS works on
it.  You may have to spring-clean and update the relevant makefiles
(which we have left for exactly this purpose, even though we are unable
to maintain them).  New files are added and sometimes reorganised
which sometimes requires changes to makefiles; we can't do this for
platforms we don't have access to.  Also compiler options often
need tweaking from release to release.
</p>
<p>
Generally support is modularised in way that makes it fairly easy to
"fill in the gaps".  So that, for example, the MPS support for the SPARC
architecture could in principle be used on a Linux/SPARC platform.  In
practice the interfaces to architecture dependent stuff tends to be
dependent on the operating system and toolchain being used.  For
combinations like FreeBSD/MIPS, Solaris/IA-32 which exist, but which
we've never had access to, it wouldn't be hard to get the MPS going on
them.
</p>

<h2 id = "uni">Unix</h2>

<p>
Note that the first build in a clean directory will produce warnings
because the dependency files (*.d) do not yet exist.  The warnings look
like this:<br />
<code>comm.gmk:533: xcppgc/hi/mpsi.d: No such file or directory</code>
<br />
The warnings are normal and do not indicate a problem.  After the
warning is emitted, the build-system makes the dependency file.
Subsequent builds in the non-clean directory see these dependency files
and do not emit the warning.
</p>

<h3 id = "macosx">Mac OS X</h3>

<p>
2005-02-02<br />
Building on early releases of Mac OS X (DP3? 10.1?) required various
workarounds to get a clean compile.  These workarounds have now been
removed from master sources.  RHSK.

</p>

<p>
2006-10-10<br />
Intel Macs.  It's now possible to use xci3gc.gmk to build on Intel
architectures.  Threads not supported.
</p>
<p>
2007-12-21<br />
Building on early releases of Mac OS X (DP3? 10.1?) required various
(now unnecessary) compiler flags to suppress warnings from Mac OS X
header files.  These warnings are no loner suppressed.
Additionally, an obsolete flag for GDB (debugging) output is beleived
no longer necessary, and has been reverted.

</p>


<h2 id = "win">Windows</h2>
<p>
2005-10-06 (1.105)<br />
All MPS versions are now built with /Gs (for compilations) and /GZ
(for linking).  This suppresses stack probe / stack check, which
would otherwise require __chkesp from C library.  This change was
necessary to enable the new DLL version of the MPS, "mpsdy.dll".
RHSK.

<p>
2010-03-03 (1.109.0)<br />
New platform "w3i3m9" -- using Microsoft Visual C++ 9.0<br />
This platform is a clone of w3i3mv; the only differences are:
<ul>
<li>compiler and linker options (see commpre9.nmk);</li>
<li>use w3i3m9.nmk (not w3i3mv.nmk) to build it;</li>
<li>the MPS_PF_STRING in version.c is "w3i3m9" (not "w3i3mv").</li>
</ul>
The only reason for this to be separate from the w3i3mv platform was
to enable builds with version 6.0 and version 9.0 compilers to be
kept separate, to enable performance comparisons.
<br />

>ravenbrook.com/project/mps/issue/job001944/</A>&gt;
</p>
<p>
2011-08<br />
The w3i3m9 platform has been withdrawn from the mainline and w3i3mv
is once again the master NT platform.
</p>
<p>
The Windows linker can accept a .def file to allow re-export of MPS
functions from a client executable that includes the MPS, such that
other client DLLs can link to and call those MPS functions.  See the
w3gen.def file (renamed mps-fns.def for Configura releases).  A
suitable command-line fragment might be "/def:w3gen.def".
