1. INTRODUCTION

This document contains build notes for the Memory Pool System Kit.  

The readership of this document is anyone who wants to build MPS 
binaries from the sources.  Read the readme.txt file first.  

This document is not complete; the MPS kit is buildable on many 
platforms that are not mentioned in these notes.  The MPS kit is 
easy to modify such that it builds on many more.  

This document is not confidential.


2. MAC OS X

2005-02-02
Building on early releases of Mac OS X (DP3? 10.1?) required various 
workarounds to get a clean compile.  These workarounds have now been 
removed from master sources.  RHSK.
See <http://www.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/issue/job000602/>


3. WINDOWS

2005-10-06 (1.105)
All MPS versions are now built with /Gs (for compilations) and /GZ 
(for linking).  This suppresses stack probe / stack check, which 
would otherwise require __chkesp from C library.  This change was 
necessary to enable the new DLL version of the MPS, "mpsdy.dll".  
RHSK.
