1. INTRODUCTION

This document contains build notes for the Memory Pool System Kit.  

The readership of this document is anyone who wants to build MPS 
binaries from the sources.  Read the readme.txt file first.  

This document is not complete; the MPS kit is buildable on many 
platforms that are not mentioned in these notes.  The MPS kit is 
easy to modify such that it builds on many more.  

This document is not confidential.


2. PLATFORM SUPPORT

The MPS has historically been built on many platforms that are either
now obsolete or to which we don't have convenient access.

Operating Systems

  OS????

  ia    Irix 6 N32 ABI
  li    Linux
  o1    OSF/1 aka Tru64
  so    Solaris 5.x and successors
  su    SunOS 4.x
  s7    Mac OS 7 through 9

CPU Architectures

  ??AR??

  al    ALPHA AXP
  i3    Intel IA-32
  i4    Same as i3 (a mistake)
  m4    MIPS IV
  pp    PowerPC (32-bit)
  s8    SPARC v8
  s9    SPARC v9 (32-bit)
  m6    Motorola 68K family

Compiler Toolchains

  ????CC

  cc    Vendor Supplied CC
  gc    GCC
  eg    EGCS
  cx    SunPro C CXREF tool
  gp    GCC with profiling
  mv    Microsoft Visual C

The full list of platforms that have ever been supported:

fri4gc  Maintained
i5m2cc  Not maintained (no makefile)
iam4cc  Not maintained
lii3eg  Not maintained
lii4gc  Maintained
lippgc  Not maintained
o1alcc  Not maintained
o1algc  Not maintained
s7m6mw  Not maintained (no makefile)
s7ppac  Not maintained
s7ppmw  Not maintained
sos8cx  Not maintained
sos8gc  Not maintained
sos8gp  Not maintained
sos9sc  Not maintained
sus8gc  Not maintained
w3almv  Not maintained
w3i3mv  Maintained
w3ppmv  Not Maintained
xci3gc  Maintained
xcppgc  Maintained (in sunset)

Platforms listed as "maintained" are used at Ravenbrook and the MPS
should work well on them.  OS X on PowerPC (xcppgc) is in decline as
Apple have moved to Intel architecture and are no longer shipping
PowerPC based systems.

Platforms are generally listed as "not maintained" if Ravenbrook
doesn't have access to a suitable machine.  Should you have access
to such a platform though, you should find that the MPS works on
it.  You may have to spring-clean and update the relevant makefiles
(which we have left for exactly this purpose, even though we are unable
to maintain them).  New files are added and sometimes reorganised
which sometimes requires changes to makefiles; we can't do this for
platforms we don't have access to.  Also compiler options often
need tweaking from release to release.

Generally support is modularised in way that makes it fairly easy to
"fill in the gaps".  So that, for example, the MPS support for the SPARC
architecture could in principle be used on a Linux/SPARC platform.  In
practice the interfaces to architecture dependent stuff tends to be
dependent on the operating system and toolchain being used.  For
combinations like FreeBSD/MIPS, Solaris/IA-32 which exist, but which
we've never had access to, it wouldn't be hard to get the MPS going on
them.


3. UNIX

Note that the first build in a clean directory will produce warnings 
because the dependency files (*.d) do not yet exist.  The warnings look 
like this:
  comm.gmk:533: xcppgc/hi/mpsi.d: No such file or directory
The warnings are normal and do not indicate a problem.  After the 
warning is emitted, the build-system makes the dependency file. 
Subsequent builds in the non-clean directory see these dependency files 
and do not emit the warning.


3.1. MAC OS X

2005-02-02
Building on early releases of Mac OS X (DP3? 10.1?) required various 
workarounds to get a clean compile.  These workarounds have now been 
removed from master sources.  RHSK.
See <http://www.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/issue/job000602/>

2006-10-10
Intel Macs.  It's now possible to use xci3gc.gmk to build on Intel
architectures.  Threads not supported.

2007-12-21
Building on early releases of Mac OS X (DP3? 10.1?) required various 
(now unnecessary) compiler flags to suppress warnings from Mac OS X 
header files.  These warnings are no loner suppressed.
Additionally, an obsolete flag for GDB (debugging) output is beleived 
no longer necessary, and has been reverted.
See <http://www.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/issue/job001714/>


4. WINDOWS

2005-10-06 (1.105)
All MPS versions are now built with /Gs (for compilations) and /GZ 
(for linking).  This suppresses stack probe / stack check, which 
would otherwise require __chkesp from C library.  This change was 
necessary to enable the new DLL version of the MPS, "mpsdy.dll".  
RHSK.
See <http://www.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/master/manual/supplement/dll-notes/>

2008-10-23 (1.108.3)
New platform "w3i3m9" -- using Microsoft Visual C++ 9.0
This platform is a clone of w3i3mv; the only differences are:
  - compiler & linker options (see commpre9.nmk);
  - use w3i3m9.nmk (not w3i3mv.nmk) to build it;
  - the MPS_PF_STRING in version.c is "w3i3m9" (not "w3i3mv").
The only reason for this to be separate from the w3i3mv platform is 
to enable builds with version 6.0 and version 9.0 compilers to be 
kept separate, to enable performance comparisons.  The w3i3m9 
clone may merge back into w3i3mv in the future.
RHSK.
