Year  Milestone
====  ==================================================================
1801  First :term:`memory (1)` device invented by Joseph-Marie Jaquard,
      in the form of perforated cards for a programmable loom.

1833  Charles Babbage designs his Analytical Engine, a steam-powered,
      general-purpose, mechanical computer with brass gears as internal
      memory and punched cards for input. The design is never
      constructed.

1884  Herman Hollerith applies for a patent for his punched-card
      machines.

1938  Konrad Zuse constructs an electromechanical computer in Germany.

1943  Colossus, a vacuum-tube device for breaking codes at Bletchley
      Park in Britain, becomes the first all-electronic calculating
      device. It uses paper tape for input with optical readers.

1947  Magnetic drums are introduced.

1949  EDSAC started up at Cambridge University in Britain. This is the
      first Von Neumann or "stored-program" machine, where the
      instructions are stored in the same type of memory as data.

1949  First tests of magnetic disks.

1952  RCA Bizmac produced with iron-:term:`core` memory and a magnetic
      drum.

1953  The first magnetic tape drive produced.

1953  IBM 650 produced, the first mass-produced drum-memory machine.

1957  First :term:`Fortran` compiler delivered, with :term:`static
      allocation` only.

1957  Disk memory produced, for the IBM305 RAMAC.

1958  :term:`Heap allocation`, :term:`garbage collection` and
      :term:`Lisp` invented by John McCarthy :ref:`(McCarthy 1960)
      <MCCARTHY60>`.

1958  :term:`Algol`, the first block-structured language, appears,
      providing :term:`stack allocation`.

1961  Compatible Time-Sharing System (CTSS) available, the first system
      with :term:`paging`.

1962  Atlas available, the first computer with :term:`virtual memory`.

1965  Maurice Wilkes and Gordon Scarott propose the use of :term:`cache
      memory`.

1967  :term:`Simula` becomes the first object-oriented language.

1969  Intel announce a 1 kilobit :term:`RAM` chip.

1970  Intel produce the 1103, the first generally available
      :term:`DRAM <dynamic memory>`.

1970  :term:`Prolog` invented by Alain Colmerauer.

1971  IBM produce the 8-inch floppy disk.

1971  Intel produce the 1701 erasable :term:`ROM`.

1971  Intel 4004 produced, the first commercially available
      microprocessor.

1972  :term:`C` designed by Dennis Ritchie.  5¼-inch floppy disks appear.

1974  Intel produce the 8080 microprocessor, which can access 64 kB of
      memory.

1975  :term:`Tri-color marking` invented by :ref:`Edsger W. Dijkstra at
      al. <DLMSS76>`, the first :term:`incremental garbage collection`
      algorithm. .

1979  First digital video disks from Sony and Philips.

1980  Winchester hard drive produced by Alan Shugart, the first large
      storage device for PCs.

1981  IBM decides that no PC user will ever need more than 640 kB of
      memory.

1983  :term:`Generational garbage collection` developed by
      :ref:`Lieberman and Hewitt <LH83>`.

1984  :term:`Generational garbage collection` used for :term:`Smalltalk`
      by :ref:`Dave Ungar <UNGAR84>`.

1991  :term:`Scheme` standardized; first garbage-collected language with
      an international standard.

1995  :term:`Java` announced by a team of Sun engineers led by James
      Gosling.

2002  New :term:`COBOL` standard includes garbage collection.
