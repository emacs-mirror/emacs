AWL pool class
==============

.. mps:prefix:: design.mps.poolawl
   pair: AWL pool class; design
   single: pool class; AWL design


Introduction
------------

:mps:tag:`readership` Any MPS developer.

:mps:tag:`intro` The AWL (Automatic Weak Linked) pool is used to manage
Dylan Weak Tables (see req.dylan.fun.weak). Currently the design is
specialised for Dylan Weak Tables, but it could be generalised in the
future.


Requirements
------------

See req.dylan.fun.weak.

See meeting.dylan.1997-02-27(0) where many of the requirements for
this pool were first sorted out.

Must satisfy request.dylan.170123_.

.. _request.dylan.170123: https://info.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/import/2001-11-05/mmprevol/request/dylan/170123

:mps:tag:`req.obj-format` Only objects of a certain format need be
supported. This format is a subset of the Dylan Object Format. The
pool uses the first slot in the fixed part of an object to store an
association. See mail.drj.1997-03-11.12-05


Definitions
-----------

:mps:tag:`def.grain` alignment grain, grain. A grain is a range of addresses
where both the base and the limit of the range are aligned and the
size of range is equal to the (same) alignment. In this context the
alignment is the pool's alignment (``pool->alignment``). The grain is
the unit of allocation, marking, scanning, etc.


Overview
--------

:mps:tag:`overview`

:mps:tag:`overview.ms` The pool is mark and sweep. :mps:tag:`overview.ms.justify`
Mark-sweep pools are slightly easier to write (than moving pools), and
there are no requirements (yet) that this pool be high performance or
moving or anything like that.

:mps:tag:`overview.alloc` It is possible to allocate weak or exact objects
using the normal reserve/commit AP protocol.
:mps:tag:`overview.alloc.justify` Allocation of both weak and exact objects
is required to implement Dylan Weak Tables. Objects are formatted; the
pool uses format A.

:mps:tag:`overview.scan` The pool handles the scanning of weak objects
specially so that when a weak reference is deleted the corresponding
reference in an associated object is deleted. The associated object is
determined by using information stored in the object itself (see
:mps:ref:`.req.obj-format`).


Interface
---------

:mps:tag:`if.init` The init method takes one extra parameter in the vararg
list. This parameter should have type :c:type:`Format` and be a format
object that describes the format of the objects to be allocated in
this pool. The format should support scan and skip methods. There is
an additional restriction on the layout of objects, see
:mps:ref:`.req.obj-format`.

:mps:tag:`if.buffer` The :c:func:`BufferInit()` method takes one extra parameter
in the vararg list. This parameter should be either ``RankEXACT`` or
``RankWEAK``. It determines the rank of the objects allocated using
that buffer.


Data structures
---------------

:mps:tag:`sig` This signature for this pool will be 0x519bla3l (SIGPooLAWL).

:mps:tag:`poolstruct` The class specific pool structure is::

    struct AWLStruct {
      PoolStruct poolStruct;
      Format format;
      Shift alignShift;
      ActionStruct actionStruct;
      double lastCollected;
      Serial gen;
      Sig sig;
    }

:mps:tag:`poolstruct.format` The format field is used to refer to the object
format. The object format is passed to the pool during pool creation.

:mps:tag:`poolstruct.alignshift` The ``alignShift`` field is the
``SizeLog2`` of the pool's alignment. It is computed and initialised
when a pool is created. It is used to compute the number of alignment
grains in a segment which is the number of bits need in the segment's
mark and alloc bit table (see :mps:ref:`.awlseg.bt`, :mps:ref:`.awlseg.mark`, and
:mps:ref:`.awlseg.alloc` below).

.. note::

    Clarify this.

:mps:tag:`poolstruct.actionStruct` Contains an Action which is used to
participate in the collection benefit protocol. See :c:func:`AWLBenefit()`
below for a description of the algorithm used for determining when to
collect.

:mps:tag:`poolstruct.lastCollected` Records the time (using the mutator
total allocation clock, ie that returned by
:c:func:`ArenaMutatorAllocSize()`) of the most recent call to either
:c:func:`AWLInit()` or :c:func:`AWLTraceBegin()` for this pool. So this is the
time of the beginning of the last collection of this pool. Actually
this isn't true because the pool can be collected without
:c:func:`AWLTraceBegin()` being called (I think) as it will get collected by
being in the same zone as another pool/generation that is being
collected (which it does arrange to be, see the use of the gen field
in :mps:ref:`.poolstruct.gen` below and :mps:ref:`.fun.awlsegcreate.where` below).

:mps:tag:`poolstruct.gen` This part of the mechanism by which the pool
arranges to be in a particular zone and arranges to be collected
simultaneously with other cohorts in the system. ``gen`` is the
generation that is used in expressing a generation preference when
allocating a segment. The intention is that this pool will get
collected simultaneously with any other segments that are also
allocated using this generation preference (when using the VM arena,
generation preferences get mapped more or less to zones, each
generation to a unique set of zones in the ideal case). Whilst AWL is
not generational it is expected that this mechanism will arrange for
it to be collected simultaneously with some particular generation of
AMC.

:mps:tag:`poolstruct.gen.1` At the moment the ``gen`` field is set for all
AWL pools to be 1.

:mps:tag:`awlseg` The pool defines a segment class :c:type:`AWLSegClass`, which is
a subclass of :c:type:`GCSegClass` (see
design.mps.seg.over.hierarchy.gcseg). All segments allocated by the
pool are instances of this class, and are of type ``AWLSeg``, for
which the structure is::

    struct AWLSegStruct {
      GCSegStruct gcSegStruct; 
      BT mark;
      BT scanned;
      BT alloc;
      Count grains;
      Count free;
      Count singleAccesses;
      AWLStatSegStruct stats;
      Sig sig;
    }

:mps:tag:`awlseg.bt` The mark, alloc, and scanned fields are bit-tables (see
design.mps.bt). Each bit in the table corresponds to a a single
alignment grain in the pool.

:mps:tag:`awlseg.mark` The mark bit table is used to record mark bits during
a trace. :c:func:`AWLCondemn()` (see :mps:ref:`.fun.condemn` below) sets all the
bits of this table to zero. Fix will read and set bits in this table.
Currently there is only one mark bit table. This means that the pool
can only be condemned for one trace.

:mps:tag:`awlseg.mark.justify` This is simple, and can be improved later
when we want to run more than one trace.

:mps:tag:`awlseg.scanned` The scanned bit-table is used to note which
objects have been scanned. Scanning (see :mps:ref:`.fun.scan` below) a segment
will find objects that are marked but not scanned, scan each object
found and set the corresponding bits in the scanned table.

:mps:tag:`awlseg.alloc` The alloc bit table is used to record which portions
of a segment have been allocated. Ranges of bits in this table are set
when a buffer is attached to the segment. When a buffer is flushed (ie
:c:func:`AWLBufferEmpty()` is called) from the segment, the bits
corresponding to the unused portion at the end of the buffer are
reset.

:mps:tag:`awlseg.alloc.invariant` A bit is set in the alloc table if and
only if the corresponding address is currently being buffered, or the
corresponding address lies within the range of an allocated object.

:mps:tag:`awlseg.grains` The grains field is the number of grains that fit
in the segment. Strictly speaking this is not necessary as it can be
computed from ``SegSize`` and AWL's alignment, however, precalculating
it and storing it in the segment makes the code simpler by avoiding
lots of repeated calculations.

:mps:tag:`awlseg.free` A conservative estimate of the number of free grains
in the segment. It is always guaranteed to be greater than or equal to
the number of free grains in the segment, hence can be used during
allocation to quickly pass over a segment.

Functions
---------

.. note::

    How will pool collect? It needs an action structure.

External
........

.. c:function:: Res AWLInit(Pool pool, va_list arg)

:mps:tag:`fun.init` :c:type:`AWLStruct` has four fields, each one needs initializing.

:mps:tag:`fun.init.poolstruct` The ``poolStruct`` field has already been
initialized by generic code (impl.c.pool).

:mps:tag:`fun.init.format` The format will be copied from the argument list,
checked, and written into this field.

:mps:tag:`fun.init.alignshift` The ``alignShift`` will be computed from the
pool alignment and written into this field.

:mps:tag:`fun.init.sig` The ``sig`` field will be initialized with the
signature for this pool.

.. c:function:: Res AWLFinish(Pool pool)

:mps:tag:`fun.finish` Iterates over all segments in the pool and destroys
each segment (by calling :c:func:`SegFree()`). Overwrites the sig field in
the :c:type:`AWLStruct`. Finishing the generic pool structure is done by the
generic pool code (impl.c.pool).

:mps:tag:`fun.alloc` :c:func:`PoolNoAlloc()` will be used, as this class does not
implement alloc.

:mps:tag:`fun.free` :c:func:`PoolNoFree()` will be used, as this class does not
implement free.

.. c:function:: Res AWLBufferFill(Seg *segReturn, Addr *baseReturn, Pool pool, Buffer buffer, Size size)

:mps:tag:`fun.fill` This zips round all the the segments applying
:c:func:`AWLSegAlloc()` to each segment that has the same rank as the
buffer. :c:func:`AWLSegAlloc()` attempts to find a free range, if it finds a
range then it may be bigger than the actual request, in which case the
remainder can be used to "fill" the rest of the buffer. If no free
range can be found in an existing segment then a new segment will be
created (which is at least large enough). The range of buffered
addresses is marked as allocated in the segment's alloc table.

.. c:function:: void AWLBufferEmpty(Pool pool, Buffer buffer)

:mps:tag:`fun.empty` Locates the free portion of the buffer, that is the
memory between the init and the limit of the buffer and records these
locations as being free in the relevant alloc table. The segment that
the buffer is pointing at (which contains the alloc table that needs
to be dinked with) is available via :c:func:`BufferSeg()`.

:mps:tag:`fun.benefit` The benefit returned is the total amount of mutator
allocation minus the ``lastRembemberedSize`` minus 10 MiB, so the pool
becomes an increasingly good candidate for collection at a constant
(mutator allocation) rate, crossing the 0 line when there has been
10 MiB of allocation since the (beginning of the) last collection. So
it gets collected approximately every 10 MiB of allocation. Note that
it will also get collected by virtue of being in the same zone as some
AMC generation (assuming there are instantiated AMC pools), see
:mps:ref:`.poolstruct.gen` above.

.. c:function:: Res AWLCondemn(Pool pool, Trace trace, Seg seg)

:mps:tag:`fun.condemn` The current design only permits each segment to be
condemned for one trace (see :mps:ref:`.awlseg.mark`). This function checks
that the segment is not condemned for any trace (``seg->white ==
TraceSetEMPTY``). The segment's mark bit-table is reset, and the
whiteness of the seg (``seg->white``) has the current trace added to
it.

.. c:function:: void AWLGrey(Pool pool, Trace trace, Seg seg)

:mps:tag:`fun.grey` If the segment is not condemned for this trace the
segment's mark table is set to all 1s and the segment is recorded as
being grey.

.. c:function:: Res AWLScan(ScanState ss, Pool pool, Seg seg)

:mps:tag:`fun.scan`

:mps:tag:`fun.scan.overview` The scanner performs a number of passes over
the segment, scanning each marked and unscanned (grey) object that is
finds.

:mps:tag:`fun.scan.overview.finish` It keeps perform a pass over the segment
until it is finished.

:mps:tag:`fun.scan.overview.finish.condition` A condition for finishing is
that no new marks got placed on objects in this segment during the
pass.

:mps:tag:`fun.scan.overview.finish.approximation` We use an even stronger
condition for finishing that assumes that scanning any object may
introduce marks onto this segment. It is finished when a pass results
in scanning no objects (that is, all objects were either unmarked or
both marked and scanned).

:mps:tag:`fun.scan.overview.finished-flag` There is a flag called
``finished`` which keeps track of whether we should finish or not. We
only ever finish at the end of a pass. At the beginning of a pass the
flag is set. During a pass if any objects are scanned then the
``finished`` flag is reset. At the end of a pass if the ``finished``
flag is still set then we are finished. No more passes take place and
the function returns.

:mps:tag:`fun.scan.pass` A pass consists of a setup phase and a repeated
phase.

:mps:tag:`fun.scan.pass.buffer` The following assumes that in the general
case the segment is buffered; if the segment is not buffered then the
actions that mention buffers are not taken (they are unimportant if
the segment is not buffered).

:mps:tag:`fun.scan.pass.p` The pass uses a cursor called ``p`` to progress
over the segment. During a pass ``p`` will increase from the base
address of the segment to the limit address of the segment. When ``p``
reaches the limit address of the segment, the pass in complete.

:mps:tag:`fun.scan.pass.setup` ``p`` initially points to the base address of
the segment.

:mps:tag:`fun.scan.pass.repeat` The following comprises the repeated phase.
The repeated phase is repeated until the pass completion condition is
true (that is, ``p`` has reached the limit of the segment, see
:mps:ref:`.fun.scan.pass.p` above and :mps:ref:`.fun.scan.pass.repeat.complete`
below).

:mps:tag:`fun.scan.pass.repeat.complete` If ``p`` is equal to the segment's
limit then we are done. We proceed to check whether any further passes
need to be performed (see :mps:ref:`.fun.scan.pass.more` below).

:mps:tag:`fun.scan.pass.repeat.free` If ``!alloc(p)`` (the grain is free)
then increment ``p`` and return to the beginning of the loop.

:mps:tag:`fun.scan.pass.repeat.buffer` If ``p`` is equal to the buffer's
ScanLimit, as returned by :c:func:`BufferScanLimit()`, then set ``p`` equal
to the buffer's Limit, as returned by :c:func:`BufferLimit()` and return to
the beginning of the loop.

:mps:tag:`fun.scan.pass.repeat.object-end` The end of the object is located
using the ``format->skip`` method.

:mps:tag:`fun.scan.pass.repeat.object` if ``mark(p) && !scanned(p)`` then
the object pointed at is marked but not scanned, which means we must
scan it, otherwise we must skip it.

:mps:tag:`fun.scan.pass.repeat.object.dependent` To scan the object the 
object we first have to determine if the object has a dependent object (see 
:mps:ref:`.req.obj-format`).

:mps:tag:`fun.scan.pass.repeat.object.dependent.expose` If it has a
dependent object then we must expose the segment that the dependent
object is on (only if the dependent object actually points to MPS
managed memory) prior to scanning and cover the segment subsequent to
scanning.

:mps:tag:`fun.scan.pass.repeat.object.dependent.summary` The summary of the
dependent segment must be set to ``RefSetUNIV`` to reflect the fact
that we are allowing it to be written to (and we don't know what gets
written to the segment).

:mps:tag:`fun.scan.pass.repeat.object.scan` The object is then scanned by
calling the format's scan method with base and limit set to the
beginning and end of the object (:mps:tag:`fun.scan.scan.improve.single` A
scan1 format method would make it slightly simpler here). Then the
finished flag is cleared and the bit in the segment's scanned table is
set.

:mps:tag:`fun.scan.pass.repeat.advance` ``p`` is advanced past the object
and we return to the beginning of the loop.

:mps:tag:`fun.scan.pass.more` At the end of a pass the finished flag is
examined.

:mps:tag:`fun.scan.pass.more.not` If the finished flag is set then we are
done (see :mps:ref:`.fun.scan.overview.finished-flag` above), :c:func:`AWLScan()`
returns.

:mps:tag:`fun.scan.pass.more.so` Otherwise (the finished flag is reset) we
perform another pass (see :mps:ref:`.fun.scan.pass` above).

.. c:function:: Res AWLFix(Pool pool, ScanState ss, Seg seg, Ref *refIO)

:mps:tag:`fun.fix` ``ss->wasMarked`` is set to :c:macro:`TRUE` (clear compliance
with design.mps.fix.protocol.was-marked.conservative).

If the rank (``ss->rank``) is ``RankAMBIG`` then fix returns
immediately unless the reference is aligned to the pool alignment.

If the rank (``ss->rank``) is ``RankAMBIG`` then fix returns
immediately unless the referenced grain is allocated.

The bit in the marked table corresponding to the referenced grain will
be read. If it is already marked then fix returns. Otherwise (the
grain is unmarked), ``ss->wasMarked`` is set to :c:macro:`FALSE`, the
remaining actions depend on whether the rank (``ss->rank``) is
``RankWEAK`` or not. If the rank is weak then the reference is
adjusted to 0 (see design.mps.weakness) and fix returns. If the rank
is something else then the mark bit corresponding to the referenced
grain is set, and the segment is greyed using :c:func:`TraceSegGreyen()`.

Fix returns.


.. c:function:: void AWLReclaim(Pool pool, Trace trace, Seg seg)

:mps:tag:`fun.reclaim` This iterates over all allocated objects in the
segment and frees objects that are not marked. When this iteration is
complete the marked array is completely reset.

``p`` points to base of segment. Then::

    while(p < SegLimit(seg) {
      if(!alloc(p)) { ++p;continue; }
      q = skip(p) /* q points to just past the object pointed at by p */
      if !marked(p) free(p, q); /* reset the bits in the alloc table from p to q-1 inclusive. */
      p = q
    }

Finally, reset the entire marked array using :c:func:`BTResRange()`.

:mps:tag:`fun.reclaim.improve.pad` Consider filling free ranges with padding
objects. Now reclaim doesn't need to check that the objects are
allocated before skipping them. There may be a corresponding change
for scan as well.

.. c:function:: Res AWLDescribe(Pool pool, mps_lib_FILE *stream)

:mps:tag:`fun.describe`


Internal
........

.. c:function:: Res AWLSegCreate(AWLSeg *awlsegReturn, Size size)

:mps:tag:`fun.awlsegcreate` Creates a segment of class :c:type:`AWLSegClass` of size at least ``size``.

:mps:tag:`fun.awlsegcreate.size.round` ``size`` is rounded up to an
``ArenaAlign`` before requesting the segment.
:mps:tag:`fun.awlsegcreate.size.round.justify` The arena requires that all
segment sizes are aligned to the ``ArenaAlign``.

:mps:tag:`fun.awlsegcreate.where` The segment is allocated using a
generation preference, using the generation number stored in the
:c:type:`AWLStruct` (the ``gen`` field), see :mps:ref:`.poolstruct.gen` above.

.. c:function:: Res awlSegInit(Seg seg, Pool pool, Addr base, Size size, Bool reservoirPermit, va_list args)

:mps:tag:`fun.awlseginit` Init method for :c:type:`AWLSegClass`, called for
:c:func:`SegAlloc()` whenever an ``AWLSeg`` is created (see
:mps:ref:`.fun.awlsegcreate` above).

:mps:tag:`fun.awlseginit.tables` The segment's mark scanned and alloc tables
(see :mps:ref:`.awlseg.bt` above) are allocated and initialised. The segment's
grains field is computed and stored.

.. c:function:: void awlSegFinish(Seg seg)

:mps:tag:`fun.awlsegfinish` Finish method for :c:type:`AWLSegClass`, called from
:c:func:`SegFree()`. Will free the segment's tables (see :mps:ref:`.awlseg.bt`).

.. c:function:: Bool AWLSegAlloc(Addr *baseReturn, Addr *limitReturn, AWLSeg awlseg, AWL awl, Size size)

:mps:tag:`fun.awlsegalloc` Will search for a free block in the segment that
is at least size bytes long. The base address of the block is returned
in ``*baseReturn``, the limit of the entire free block (which must be
at least as large size and may be bigger) is returned in
``*limitReturn``. The requested size is converted to a number of
grains, :c:func:`BTFindResRange()` is called to find a run of this length in
the alloc bit-table (:mps:ref:`.awlseg.alloc`). The return results (if it is
successful) from :c:func:`BTFindResRange()` are in terms of grains, they are
converted back to addresses before returning the relevant values from
this function.

.. c:function:: Bool AWLDependentObject(Addr *objReturn, Addr parent)

:mps:tag:`fun.dependent-object` This function abstracts the association
between an object and its linked dependent (see :mps:ref:`.req.obj-format`).
It currently assumes that objects are Dylan Object formatted according
to design.dylan.container (see analysis.mps.poolawl.dependent.abstract
for suggested improvements). An object has a dependent object iff the
second word of the object, that is, ``((Word *)parent)[1]``, is
non-:c:macro:`NULL`. The dependent object is the object referenced by the
second word and must be a valid object.

This function assumes objects are in Dylan Object Format (see
design.dylan.container). It will check that the first word looks like
a Dylan wrapper pointer. It will check that the wrapper indicates that
the wrapper has a reasonable format (namely at least one fixed field).
If the second word is :c:macro:`NULL` it will return :c:macro:`FALSE`. If the second
word is non-:c:macro:`NULL` then the contents of it will be assigned to
``*objReturn``, and it will return :c:macro:`TRUE`.


Test
----

- must create Dylan objects.
- must create Dylan vectors with at least one fixed field.
- must allocate weak thingies.
- must allocate exact tables.
- must link tables together.
- must populate tables with junk.
- some junk must die.

Use an LO pool and an AWL pool. Three buffers. One buffer for the LO
pool, one exact buffer for the AWL pool, one weak buffer for the AWL
pool.

Initial test will allocate one object from each buffer and then
destroy all buffers and pools and exit
