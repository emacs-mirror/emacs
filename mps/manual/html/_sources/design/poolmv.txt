MV pool class
=============

.. mps:prefix:: design.mps.poolmv


Implementation
--------------

:mps:tag:`lost` It is possible for MV to "lose" memory when freeing an
objects. This happens when an extra block descriptor is needed (ie the
interior of a block is being freed) and the call to allocate the block
fails.
