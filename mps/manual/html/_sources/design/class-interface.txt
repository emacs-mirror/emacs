Pool class interface
====================

.. mps:prefix:: design.mps.class-interface


Introduction
-------------

:mps:tag:`intro` This document describes the interface and protocols between
the MPM and the pool class implementations.

.. note::

    This document should be merged into design.mps.pool. Pekka P.
    Pirinen, 1999-07-20.


Methods
-------

:mps:tag:`methods` These methods are provided by pool classes as part of the
:c:type:`PoolClass` object (see impl.h.mpmst.class). They form the interface
which allows the MPM to treat pools in a uniform manner.

The following description is based on the definition of the
:c:type:`PoolClassStruct` (impl.h.mpmst.class).

If a class is not required to provide a certain method then it should
set the appropriate ``PoolNo*`` method for that method. It is not
acceptable to use :c:macro:`NULL`.

.. note::

    There are also some ``PoolTriv*`` methods. David Jones, 1997-08-19.

:mps:tag:`method.name` The name field should be a short, pithy, cryptic name
for the pool class. Examples are "AMC", "MV".

The ``size`` field is the size of the pool instance structure. For the
``Foo`` :c:type:`PoolClass` this can reasonably be expected to be
``sizeof(FooStruct)``.

The ``offset`` field is the offset into the pool instance structure of
the generic :c:type:`PoolStruct`. Typically this field is called
``poolStruct``, so something like ``offsetof(FooStruct, poolStruct)``
is typical. If possible, arrange for this to be zero.

The ``init`` field is the class's init method. This method is called
via the generic function :c:func:`PoolInit()`, which is in turn called by
:c:func:`PoolCreate()`. The generic function allocates the pool's structure
(using the size and offset information), initializes the
:c:type:`PoolStruct` (generic part) then calls the ``init`` method to do any
class-specific initialization. Typically this means initializing the
fields in the class instance structure. If ``init`` returns a non-OK
result code the instance structure will be deallocated and the code
returned to the caller of :c:func:`PoolInit()`` or :c:func:`PoolCreate()`. Note that
the :c:type:`PoolStruct` isn't made fully valid until :c:func:`PoolInit()` returns.

The ``finish`` field is the class's finish method. This method is
called via the generic function :c:func:`PoolFinish()`, which is in turn
called by :c:func:`PoolDestroy()`. It is expected to finalise the pool
instance structure and release any resources allocated to the pool, it
is expected to release the memory associated with the pool instance
structure. Note that the pool is valid when it is passed to
``finish``. The :c:type:`PoolStruct` (generic part) is finished off when the
class's ``finish`` method returns.

The ``alloc`` field is the class's allocation method. This method is
called via the generic function :c:func:`PoolAlloc()`. It is expected to
return a pointer to a fresh (that is, not overlapping with any other
live object) object of the required size. Failure to allocate should
be indicated by returning an appropriate Error code, and in such a
case, ``*pReturn`` should not be updated. Classes are not required to
provide this method, but they should provide at least one of ``alloc``
and ``bufferCreate``.

.. note::

    There is no ``bufferCreate``. Gareth Rees, 2013-04-14.

The ``free_`` field is the class's free method. This is intended
primarily for manual style pools. this method is called via the
generic function :c:func:`PoolFree()`. The parameters to this method are
required to correspond to a previous allocation request (possibly via
a buffer). It is an assertion by the client that the indicated object
is no longer required and the resources associated with it can be
recycled. Pools are not required to provide this method.

The ``bufferInit`` field is the class's buffer initialization method.
It is called by the generic function :c:func:`BufferCreate()`, which allocates
the buffer descriptor and initializes the generic fields. The pool may
optionally adjust these fields or fill in extra values when
``bufferInit`` is called, but often pools set ``bufferInit`` to
:c:func:`PoolTrivBufferInit()` because they don't need to do any. If
``bufferInit`` returns a result code other than ``ResOK``, the buffer
structure is deallocated and the code is returned to the called of
:c:func:`BufferCreate()`. Note that the :c:type:`BufferStruct` isn't fully valid
until :c:func:`BufferCreate()` returns.

The ``bufferFinish`` field is the class's buffer finishing method. It
is called by the the generic function :c:func:`BufferDestroy()`. The pool is
expected to detach the buffer from any memory and prepare the buffer
for destruction. The class is expected to release the resources
associated with the buffer structure, and any unreserved memory in the
buffer may be recycled. It is illegal for a buffer to be destroyed
when there are pending allocations on it (that is, an allocation has
been reserved, but not committed) and this is checked in the generic
function. This method should be provided if and only if
``bufferCreate`` is provided. [there is no ``bufferCreate`` -- drj
1997-08-19]

The ``condemn`` field is used to condemn a pool. This method is called
via the generic function :c:func:`PoolCondemn()`. The class is expected to
condemn a subset (possible the whole set) of objects it manages and
participate in a global trace to determine liveness. The class should
register the refsig of the condemned set with the trace using
:c:func:`TraceCondemn()`. The class should expect fix requests (via the fix
method below) during a global trace. Classes are not required to
provide this method, but it is expected that automatic style classes
will. This interface is expected to change in the future.

.. note::

    ``condemn`` now takes an action and a segment and should condemn
    the segment (turn it white) if it corresponds to the
    interpretation of the action. David Jones, 1997-08-19.

    It is now called ``whiten``. David Jones, 1998-02-02.

The ``mark`` field is used to mark an entire pool. This method is
called via the generic function :c:func:`PoolMark()`. The class should
consider all of its objects, except any set that has been condemned in
this trace, to be marked, that is ready for scanning. The class should
arrange that any appropriate invariants are preserved possibly by the
Protection interface. Classes are not required to provide this method,
and not doing so indicates that all instances of this class will have
no fixable or traceable references in them.

.. note::

    ``mark`` is no longer present: ``grey`` turns an entire segment
    grey. David Jones, 1997-08-19.

The ``scan`` field is used to perform scanning. This method is called
via the generic function :c:func:`PoolScan()`. The class should scan the
segment specified. It should scan all the known live (marked, that is,
those objects on which fix has been called) on the segment and
accumulate a summary of *all* the objects on the segment. This means
that mark and sweep pools may have to jump through hoops a little bit
(see design.mps.poolasm.summary for a pedagogical example). Classes
are not required to provide this method, and not doing so indicates
that all instances of this class will have no fixable or traceable
reference in them.

.. note::

    The ``scan`` method now takes an extra return parameter which
    classes should use to indicate whether they scanned all objects in
    segment or not. Classes should return summary only of object they
    scanned. Caller of this method (:c:func:`TraceScan()`) is responsible
    for updating summaries correctly when not a total scan. Hence no
    jumping through hoops required. David Jones, 1998-01-30.

The ``fix`` field is used to perform fixing. This method is called via
the generic function :c:func:`TraceFix()`. It indicates that the specified
reference has been found and the class should consider the object
live. There is provision for adjusting the value of the reference (to
allow for classes that move objects). Classes are not required to
provide this method, and not doing so indicates that the class is not
automatic style (ie it does not use global tracing to determine
liveness).

The ``reclaim`` field is used to reclaim memory. This method is called
via the generic function :c:func:`PoolReclaim()`. It indicates that the trace
has fixed all references to reachable objects.

.. note::

    Actually it indicates that any remaining white objects have now
    been proved unreachable, hence are dead. David Jones, 1997-08-19.

The class should consider objects that have been condemned and not
fixed in this trace to be dead and may reclaim the resources
associated with them. Classes are not required to provide this method.

.. note::

    ``reclaim`` is now called on each segment. David Jones,
    1997-08-19.

The ``access`` field is used to indicate client access. This method is
called via the generic functions :c:func:`SpaceAccess()` and
:c:func:`PoolAccess()`. It indicates that the client has attempted to access
the specified region, but has been denied and the request trapped due
to a protection state. The class should perform any work necessary to
remove the protection whilst still preserving appropriate invariants
(typically this will be scanning work). Classes are not required to
provide this method, and not doing so indicates they never protect any
memory managed by the pool.

.. note::

    ``access`` is no longer present. David Jones, 1997-08-19.

:mps:tag:`method.act` ``act`` is called when the MPM has decided to execute
an action that the class declared. The Class should arrange execution
of the associated work (usually by beginning an incremental trace).

:mps:tag:`method.walk` ``walk`` is used by the heap walker. ``walk`` is only
required to be implemented by classes which specify the AttrFMT
attribute (formatted pools). The ``walk`` method should apply the
passed in function (along with its closure variables (which are also
passed in) and the object format) to all *black* objects in the
segment. Padding objects may or may not be included in the walk at the
classes discretion, in any case in will be the responsibility of the
client to do something sensible with padding objects.

.. note::

    What about broken hearts? David Jones, 1998-01-30.

The ``describe`` field is used to print out a description of a pool.
This method is called via the generic function :c:func:`PoolDescribe()`. The
class should emit an textual description of the pool's contents onto
the specified stream. Each line should begin with two spaces. Classes
are not required to provide this method.


Events
------

:mps:tag:`replay` To work with the allocation replayer (see
design.mps.telemetry.replayer), the pool has to emit an event for each
call to an external interface, containing all the parameters passed by
the user. If a new event type is required to carry this information,
the replayer (impl.c.eventrep) must then be extended to recreate the
call.

:mps:tag:`replay.Init` In particular, the ``init`` method should emit a
``PoolInit<foo>`` event with all the pool parameters.


Text
-----

:mps:tag:`alloc.size` The pool class implementation defines the meaning of
the "size" parameter to the ``alloc`` and ``free`` methods. It may not
actually correspond to a number of bytes of memory.

:mps:tag:`alloc.size.align` In particular, the class may allow an unaligned
size to be passed.
