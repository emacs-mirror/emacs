Introduction
------------

:mps:tag:`intro` This document describes the detailed design of the Virtual
Memory Arena Class of the Memory Pool System. The VM Arena Class is
just one class available in the MPS. The generic arena part is
described in design.mps.arena.


Overview
--------

:mps:tag:`overview` VM arenas provide blocks of memory to all other parts of
the MPS in the form of "tracts" using the virtual mapping interface
(design.mps.vm) to the operating system. The VM Arena Class is not
expected to be provided on platforms that do not have virtual memory
(like MacOS, os.s7(1)).

:mps:tag:`overview.gc` The VM Arena Class provides some special services on
these blocks in order to facilitate garbage collection:

:mps:tag:`overview.gc.zone` Allocation of blocks with specific zones. This
means that the generic fix function (design.mps.fix) can use a fast
refset test to eliminate references to addresses that are not in the
condemned set. This assumes that a pool class that uses this placement
appropriately is being used (such as the generation placement policy
used by AMC: see design.mps.poolamc(1)) and that the pool selects the
condemned sets to coincide with zone stripes.

:mps:tag:`overview.gc.tract` A fast translation from addresses to tract.
(See design.mps.arena.req.fun.trans)


Notes
-----

:mps:tag:`note.refset` Some of this document simply assumes that RefSets
(see the horribly incomplete design.mps.refset) have been chosen as
the solution for design.mps.arena.req.fun.set. It's a lot simpler that
way. Both to write and understand.


Requirements
------------

Most of the requirements are in fact on the generic arena (see
design.mps.arena.req). However, many of those requirements can only be
met by a suitable arena class design.

Requirements particular to this arena class:

Placement
.........

:mps:tag:`req.fun.place` It must be possible for pools to obtain tracts at
particular addresses. Such addresses shall be declared by the pool
specifying what refset zones the tracts should lie in and what refset
zones the tracts should not lie in. It is acceptable for the arena to
not always honour the request in terms of placement if it has run out
of suitable addresses.

Arena partition
...............

:mps:tag:`req.fun.set` See design.mps.arena.req.fun.set. The approximation
to sets of address must cooperate with the placement mechanism in the
way required by :mps:ref:`.req.fun.place` (above).


Architecture
------------

:mps:tag:`arch.memory` The underlying memory is obtained from whatever
Virtual Memory interface (see design.mps.vm). @@@@ Explain why this is
used.


Solution ideas
--------------

:mps:tag:`idea.grain` Set the arena granularity to the grain provided by the
virtual mapping module.

:mps:tag:`idea.mem` Get a single large contiguous address area from the
virtual mapping interface and divide that up.

:mps:tag:`idea.table` Maintain a table with one entry per grain in order to
provide fast mapping (shift and add) between addresses and table
entries.

:mps:tag:`idea.table.figure` [missing figure]

:mps:tag:`idea.map` Store the pointers (:mps:ref:`.req.fun.trans`) in the table
directly for every grain.

:mps:tag:`idea.zones` Partition the managed address space into zones (see
idea.zones) and provide the set approximation as a reference
signature.

:mps:tag:`idea.first-fit` Use a simple first-fit allocation policy for
tracts within each zone (:mps:ref:`.idea.zones`). Store the freelist in the
table (:mps:ref:`.idea.table`).

:mps:tag:`idea.base` Store information about each contiguous area (allocated
of free) in the table entry (:mps:ref:`.idea.table`) corresponding to the base
address of the area.

:mps:tag:`idea.shadow` Use the table (:mps:ref:`.idea.table`) as a "shadow" of the
operating system's page table. Keep information such as last access,
protection, etc. in this table, since we can't get at this information
otherwise.

:mps:tag:`idea.barrier` Use the table (:mps:ref:`.idea.table`) to implement the
software barrier. Each segment can have a read and/or write barrier
placed on it by each process. (:mps:tag:`idea.barrier.bits` Store a
bit-pattern which remembers which process protected what.) This will
give a fast translation from a barrier-protected address to the
barrier handler via the process table.

:mps:tag:`idea.demand-table` For a 1 GiB managed address space with a 4 KiB
page size, the table will have 256K-entries. At, say, four words per
entry, this is 4 MiB of table. Although this is only an 0.4%, the
table shouldn't be preallocated or initially it is an infinite
overhead, and with 1 MiB active, it is a 300% overhead! The address
space for the table should be reserved, but the pages for it mapped
and unmapped on demand. By storing the table in a tract, the status of
the table's pages can be determined by looking at it's own entries in
itself, and thus the translation lookup (:mps:ref:`.req.fun.trans`) is slowed
to two lookups rather than one.

:mps:tag:`idea.pool` Make the Arena Manager a pool class. Arena
initialization becomes pool creation. Tract allocation becomes
:c:func:`PoolAlloc()`. Other operations become class-specific operations on
the "arena pool".


Data structures
---------------

:mps:tag:`tables` There are two table data structures: a page table, and an
alloc table.

:mps:tag:`table.page.map` Each page in the VM has a corresponding page table
entry.

:mps:tag:`table.page.linear` The table is a linear array of PageStruct
entries; there is a simple mapping between the index in the table and
the base address in the VM. Namely:

- index to base address: ``base-address = arena-base + (index * page-size)``
- base address to index: ``index = (base-address - arena-base) / page-size``

:mps:tag:`table.page.partial` The table is partially mapped on an
"as-needed" basis. The function :c:func:`unusedTablePages()` identifies
entirely unused pages occupied by the page table itself (that is,
those pages of the page table which are occupied by :c:type:`PageStruct`
objects which all describe free pages). Tract allocation and freeing
use this function to map and unmap the page table with no hysteresis.
(There is restriction on the parameters you may pass to
:c:func:`unusedTablePages()`.)

:mps:tag:`table.page.tract` Each page table entry contains a tract, which is
only valid if it is allocated to a pool. If it is not allocated to a
pool, the fields of the tract are used for other purposes. (See
design.mps.arena.tract.field.pool)

:mps:tag:`table.alloc` The alloc table is a simple bit table (implemented
using the BT module, design.mps.bt).

:mps:tag:`table.alloc.map` Each page in the VM has a corresponding alloc
table entry.

:mps:tag:`table.alloc.semantics` The bit in the alloc table is set iff the
corresponding page is allocated (to a pool).


Notes
-----

:mps:tag:`fig.page` How the pages in the arena area are represented in the
tables.

[missing figure]

:mps:tag:`fig.count` How a count table can be used to partially map the page
table, as proposed in request.dylan.170049.sol.map.
