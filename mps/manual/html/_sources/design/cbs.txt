Coalescing block structure
==========================

.. mps:prefix:: design.mps.cbs


Introduction
------------

:mps:tag:`intro` This is the design for impl.c.cbs, which implements a data
structure for the management of non-intersecting memory ranges, with
eager coalescence.

:mps:tag:`readership` This document is intended for any MM developer.

:mps:tag:`source` design.mps.poolmv2, design.mps.poolmvff.

:mps:tag:`overview` The "coalescing block structure" is a set of addresses
(or a subset of address space), with provision for efficient
management of contiguous ranges, including insertion and deletion,
high level communication with the client about the size of contiguous
ranges, and detection of protocol violations.


Definitions
-----------

:mps:tag:`def.range` A (contiguous) *range* of addresses is a semi-open
interval on address space.

:mps:tag:`def.isolated` A contiguous range is *isolated* with respect to
some property it has, if adjacent elements do not have that property.


Requirements
------------

:mps:tag:`req.set` Must maintain a set of addresses.

:mps:tag:`req.fast` Common operations must have a low amortized cost.

:mps:tag:`req.add` Must be able to add address ranges to the set.

:mps:tag:`req.remove` Must be able to remove address ranges from the set.

:mps:tag:`req.size` Must report concisely to the client when isolated
contiguous ranges of at least a certain size appear and disappear.

:mps:tag:`req.iterate` Must support the iteration of all isolated
contiguous ranges. This will not be a common operation.

:mps:tag:`req.protocol` Must detect protocol violations.

:mps:tag:`req.debug` Must support debugging of client code.

:mps:tag:`req.small` Must have a small space overhead for the storage of
typical subsets of address space and not have abysmal overhead for the
storage of any subset of address space.

:mps:tag:`req.align` Must support an alignment (the alignment of all
addresses specifying ranges) of down to ``sizeof(void *)`` without
losing memory.


Interface
---------

:mps:tag:`header` CBS is used through impl.h.cbs.


External types
..............

.. c:type:: struct CBSStruct *CBS

:mps:tag:`type.cbs` :c:macro:`CBS` is the main data structure for manipulating a
CBS. It is intended that a :c:type:`CBSStruct` be embedded in another
structure. No convenience functions are provided for the allocation or
deallocation of the CBS.

.. c:type:: Bool (*CBSIterateMethod)(CBS cbs, Range range, void *closureP, Size closureS)

:mps:tag:`type.cbs.iterate.method` Type :c:type:`CBSIterateMethod` is a callback
function that may be passed to :c:func:`CBSIterate()`. It is called for
every isolated contiguous range in address order. The function must
returns a :c:type:`Bool` indicating whether to continue with the iteration.


External functions
..................

.. c:function:: Res CBSInit(Arena arena, CBS cbs, void *owner, Align alignment, Bool fastFind, ArgList args)

:mps:tag:`function.cbs.init` :c:func:`CBSInit()` is the function that initialises
the CBS structure. It performs allocation in the supplied arena. The
parameter ``owner`` is passed to :c:func:`MeterInit()`, an ``alignment``
indicates the alignment of ranges to be maintained. An initialised CBS
contains no ranges.

``fastFind``, if set, causes the CBS to maintain, for each subtree,
the size of the largest block in that subtree. This must be true if
any of the :c:func:`CBSFindFirst()`, :c:func:`CBSFindLast()`, or
:c:func:`CBSFindLargest()` functions are going to be used on the CBS.

:c:func:`CBSInit()` may take one keyword argument:

* :c:macro:`MPS_KEY_CBS_EXTEND_BY` (type :c:type:`Size`; default 4096) is the size
  of segment that the CBS will request from the arena in which to
  allocate its ``CBSBlock`` structures.

.. c:function:: void CBSFinish(CBS cbs)

:mps:tag:`function.cbs.finish` :c:func:`CBSFinish()` is the function that finishes
the CBS structure and discards any other resources associated with the
CBS.

.. c:function:: Res CBSInsert(Range rangeReturn, CBS cbs, Range range)

:mps:tag:`function.cbs.insert` If any part of ``range`` is already in the
CBS, then leave it unchanged and return ``ResFAIL``. Otherwise,
attempt to insert ``range`` into the CBS. If the insertion succeeds,
then update ``rangeReturn`` to describe the contiguous isolated range
containing the inserted range (this may differ from ``range`` if there
was coalescence on either side) and return ``ResOK``. If the insertion
fails, return a result code indicating allocation failure.

:mps:tag:`function.cbs.insert.fail` Insertion of a valid range (that is, one
that does not overlap with any range in the CBS) can only fail if the
new range is isolated and the allocation of the necessary data
structure to represent it failed.


.. c:function:: Res CBSDelete(Range rangeReturn, CBS cbs, Range range)

:mps:tag:`function.cbs.delete` If any part of the range is not in the CBS,
then leave the CBS unchanged and return ``ResFAIL``. Otherwise, update
``rangeReturn`` to describe the contiguous isolated range that
contains ``range`` (this may differ from ``range`` if there are
fragments on either side) and attempt to delete the range from the
CBS. If the deletion succeeds, return ``ResOK``. If the deletion
fails, return a result code indicating allocation failure.

:mps:tag:`function.cbs.delete.fail` Deletion of a valid range (that is, one
that is wholly contained in the CBS) can only fail if there are
fragments on both sides and the allocation of the necessary data
structures to represent them fails.

:mps:tag:`function.cbs.delete.return` :c:func:`CBSDelete()` returns the contiguous
isolated range that contains ``range`` even if the deletion fails.
This is so that the caller can try deleting the whole block (which is
guaranteed to succeed) and managing the fragments using a fallback
strategy.

.. c:function:: void CBSIterate(CBS cbs, CBSIterateMethod iterate, void *closureP, Size closureS)

:mps:tag:`function.cbs.iterate` :c:func:`CBSIterate()` is the function used to
iterate all isolated contiguous ranges in a CBS. It receives a
pointer, :c:type:`Size` closure pair to pass on to the iterator method,
and an iterator method to invoke on every range in address order. If
the iterator method returns :c:macro:`FALSE`, then the iteration is
terminated.

.. c:function:: Res CBSDescribe(CBS cbs, mps_lib_FILE *stream)

:mps:tag:`function.cbs.describe` :c:func:`CBSDescribe()` is a function that prints
a textual representation of the CBS to the given stream, indicating
the contiguous ranges in order, as well as the structure of the
underlying splay tree implementation. It is provided for debugging
purposes only.

.. c:function:: Bool CBSFindFirst(Range rangeReturn, Range oldRangeReturn, CBS cbs, Size size, FindDelete findDelete)

:mps:tag:`function.cbs.find.first` Locate the first block (in address order)
within the CBS of at least the specified size, update ``rangeReturn``
to describe that range, and return :c:macro:`TRUE`. If there is no such
block, it returns :c:macro:`FALSE`.

In addition, optionally delete the top, bottom, or all of the found
range, depending on the ``findDelete`` argument. This saves a separate
call to :c:func:`CBSDelete()`, and uses the knowledge of exactly where we
found the range. The value of ``findDelete`` must come from this
enumeration::

    enum {
        FindDeleteNONE,    /* don't delete after finding */
        FindDeleteLOW,     /* delete size bytes from low end of block */
        FindDeleteHIGH,    /* delete size bytes from high end of block */
        FindDeleteENTIRE   /* delete entire range */
    };

The original contiguous isolated range in which the range was found is
returned via the ``oldRangeReturn`` argument. (If ``findDelete`` is
``FindDeleteNONE`` or ``FindDeleteENTIRE``, then this will be
identical to the range returned via the ``rangeReturn`` argument.)

:c:func:`CBSFindFirst()` requires that ``fastFind`` was true when
:c:func:`CBSInit()` was called.

.. c:function:: Bool CBSFindLast(Range rangeReturn, Range oldRangeReturn, CBS cbs, Size size, FindDelete findDelete)

:mps:tag:`function.cbs.find.last` Like :c:func:`CBSFindFirst()`, except that it
finds the last block in address order.

.. c:function:: Bool CBSFindLargest(Range rangeReturn, Range oldRangeReturn, CBS cbs, Size size, FindDelete findDelete)

:mps:tag:`function.cbs.find.largest` Locate the largest block within the
CBS, and if that block is at least as big as ``size``, return its
range via the ``rangeReturn`` argument, and return :c:macro:`TRUE`. If there
are no blocks in the CBS at least as large as ``size``, return
:c:macro:`FALSE`. Pass 0 for ``size`` if you want the largest block
unconditionally.

Like :c:func:`CBSFindFirst()`, optionally delete the range (specifying
``FindDeleteLOW`` or ``FindDeleteHIGH`` has the same effect as
``FindDeleteENTIRE``). This feature requires that ``fastFind`` was
true when :c:func:`CBSInit()` was called.


Implementation
--------------

:mps:tag:`impl` This section is concerned with describing various aspects of
the implementation. It does not form part of the interface definition.



Splay tree
..........

:mps:tag:`impl.splay` The CBS is principally implemented using a splay tree
(see design.mps.splay_). Each splay tree node is embedded in a
``CBSBlock`` that represents a semi-open address range. The key passed
for comparison is the base of another range.

.. _design.mps.splay: splay

:mps:tag:`impl.splay.fast-find` :c:func:`CBSFindFirst()` and :c:func:`CBSFindLast()` use
the update/refresh facility of splay trees to store, in each
``CBSBlock``, an accurate summary of the maximum block size in the
tree rooted at the corresponding splay node. This allows rapid
location of the first or last suitable block, and very rapid failure
if there is no suitable block.

:mps:tag:`impl.find-largest` :c:func:`CBSFindLargest()` simply finds out the size
of the largest block in the CBS from the root of the tree, using
:c:func:`SplayRoot()`, and does :c:func:`SplayFindFirst()` for a block of that
size. This is O(log *n*) in the size of the free list, so it's about
the best you can do without maintaining a separate priority queue,
just to do :c:func:`CBSFindLargest()`.


Low memory behaviour
....................

:mps:tag:`impl.low-mem` When the CBS tries to allocate a new ``CBSBlock``
structure for a new isolated range as a result of either
:c:func:`CBSInsert()` or :c:func:`CBSDelete()`, and there is insufficient memory
to allocation the ``CBSBlock`` structure, then the range is not added
to the CBS or deleted from it, and the call to :c:func:`CBSInsert()` or
:c:func:`CBSDelete()` returns ``ResMEMORY``.


The CBS block
.............

:mps:tag:`impl.cbs.block` The block contains a base-limit pair and a splay
tree node.

:mps:tag:`impl.cbs.block.special` The base and limit may be equal if the
block is halfway through being deleted.

:mps:tag:`impl.cbs.block.special.just` This conflates values and status, but
is justified because block size is very important.


Testing
-------

:mps:tag:`test` The following testing will be performed on this module:

:mps:tag:`test.cbstest` There is a stress test for this module in
impl.c.cbstest. This allocates a large block of memory and then
simulates the allocation and deallocation of ranges within this block
using both a :c:macro:`CBS` and a :c:type:`BT`. It makes both valid and invalid
requests, and compares the :c:macro:`CBS` response to the correct behaviour
as determined by the :c:type:`BT`. It also iterates the ranges in the
:c:macro:`CBS`, comparing them to the :c:type:`BT`. It also invokes the
:c:func:`CBSDescribe()` method, but makes no automatic test of the resulting
output. It does not currently test the callbacks.

:mps:tag:`test.pool` Several pools (currently MVT_ and MVFF_) are implemented
on top of a CBS. These pool are subject to testing in development, QA,
and are/will be heavily exercised by customers.

.. _MVT: poolmvt
.. _MVFF: poolmvff


Notes for future development
----------------------------

:mps:tag:`future.not-splay` The initial implementation of CBSs is based on
splay trees. It could be revised to use any other data structure that
meets the requirements (especially :mps:ref:`.req.fast`).

:mps:tag:`future.hybrid` It would be possible to attenuate the problem of
:mps:ref:`.risk.overhead` (below) by using a single word bit set to represent
the membership in a (possibly aligned) word-width of grains. This
might be used for block sizes less than a word-width of grains,
converting them when they reach all free in the bit set. Note that
this would make coalescence slightly less eager, by up to
``(word-width - 1)``.


Risks
-----

:mps:tag:`risk.overhead` Clients should note that the current implementation
of CBSs has a space overhead proportional to the number of isolated
contiguous ranges. [Four words per range.] If the CBS contains every
other grain in an area, then the overhead will be large compared to
the size of that area. [Four words per two grains.] The CBS structure
is thus suitable only for managing large enough ranges.
