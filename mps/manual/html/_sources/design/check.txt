Checking
========

.. mps:prefix:: design.mps.check


Introduction
------------

:mps:tag:`intro` This documents the design of structure checking within the
MPS.

:mps:tag:`readership` MPS developers.


Implementation
--------------

:mps:tag:`level` There are three levels of checking:

1. :mps:tag:`level.sig` The lowest level checks only that the
   structure has a valid ``Signature`` (see
   design.mps.sig).

2. :mps:tag:`level.shallow` Shallow checking checks all local fields
   (including signature) and also checks the signatures of any parent
   or child structures.

3. :mps:tag:`level.deep` Deep checking checks all local fields
   (including signatures), the signatures of any parent structures,
   and does full recursive checking on any child structures.

:mps:tag:`level.control` Control over the levels of checking is via the
definition of at most one of the macros :c:macro:`TARGET_CHECK_SHALLOW`
(which if defined gives :mps:ref:`.level.shallow`), :c:macro:`TARGET_CHECK_DEEP`
(which if defined gives :mps:ref:`.level.deep`). If neither macro is defined
then :mps:ref:`.level.sig` is used. These macros are not intended to be
manipulated directly by developers, they should use the interface in
impl.h.target.

:mps:tag:`order` Because deep checking (:mps:ref:`.level.deep`) uses unchecked
recursion, it is important that child relationships are acyclic
(:mps:ref:`.macro.down`).

:mps:tag:`fun` Every abstract data type which is a structure pointer should
have a function ``<type>Check`` which takes a pointer of type
``<type>`` and returns a :c:type:`Bool`. It should check all fields in
order, using one of the macros in :mps:ref:`.macro`, or document why not.

:mps:tag:`fun.omit` The only fields which should be omitted from a check
function are those for which there is no meaningful check (for
example, an unlimited unsigned integer with no relation to other
fields).

:mps:tag:`fun.return` Although the function returns a :c:type:`Bool`, if the assert
handler returns (or there is no assert handler), then this is taken to
mean "ignore and continue", and the check function hence returns
:c:macro:`TRUE`.

:mps:tag:`macro` Checking is implemented by invoking four macros in
impl.h.assert:

.. c:function:: CHECKS(type, val)

:mps:tag:`macro.sig` ``CHECKS(type, val)`` checks the signature only, and
should be called precisely on ``type`` and the received object
pointer.

.. c:function:: CHECKL(cond)

:mps:tag:`macro.local` ``CHECKL(cond)`` checks a local field (depending on
level; see :mps:ref:`.level`), and should be called on each local field that
is not an abstract data type structure pointer itself (apart from
the signature), with an appropriate normally-true test condition.

.. c:function:: CHECKU(type, val)

:mps:tag:`macro.up` ``CHECKU(type, val)`` checks a parent abstract data
type structure pointer, performing at most signature checks
(depending on level; see :mps:ref:`.level`). It should be called with the
parent type and pointer.

.. c:function:: CHECKD(type, val)

:mps:tag:`macro.down` ``CHECKD(type, val)`` checks a child abstract data
type structure pointer, possibly invoking ``<type>Check`` (depending
on level; see :mps:ref:`.level`). It should be called with the child type
and pointer.

:mps:tag:`full-type` :c:func:`CHECKS()`, :c:func:`CHECKD()`, :c:func:`CHECKU()`, all operate
only on fully fledged types. This means the type has to provide a
function ``Bool TypeCheck(Type type)`` where ``Type`` is substituted
for the name of the type (for example, :c:func:`PoolCheck()`), and the
expression ``obj->sig`` must be a valid value of type :c:type:`Sig` whenever
``obj`` is a valid value of type ``Type``.

:mps:tag:`type.no-sig` This tag is to be referenced in implementations
whenever the form ``CHECKL(ThingCheck(thing))`` is used instead of
``CHECK{U,D}(Thing, thing)`` because ``Thing`` is not a fully fledged
type (:mps:ref:`.full-type`).
