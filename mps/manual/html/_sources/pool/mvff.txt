MVFF (Manual Variable First Fit)
================================

**MVFF** :term:`manually manages <manual memory management>`
variable-sized, unformatted objects. It uses the :term:`first fit`
:term:`allocation policy` for blocks allocated via
:c:func:`mps_alloc`.

:ref:`Johnstone (1997) <JOHNSTONE97>` found that in his test cases:

    No version of :term:`best fit` had more than 5% actual
    :term:`fragmentation <external fragmentation>`. This is also true
    for all versions of first fit that used an :term:`address-ordered
    free list <address-ordered first fit>`, and the two versions of
    first fit that used a :term:`FIFO free list <FIFO-ordered first
    fit>`. This strongly suggests that the basic best-fit algorithm
    and the first-fit algorithm with an address-ordered free list are
    very robust algorithms.

The MVFF pool class also supports buffered allocation (that is,
allocation via :term:`allocation points`), and in this case, the
allocation policy is different: the buffers are filled according to
the :term:`worst fit` policy, and allocation always proceeds upwards
from the base.

Buffered and unbuffered allocation can be used at the same time, but
the first allocation point must be created before any call to
:c:func:`mps_alloc`.

It is usually not advisable to use buffered and unbuffered allocation
on the same pool, because the worst-fit policy of buffer filling will
grab all the large blocks, leading to severe fragmentation. If you
need both forms of allocation, use two separate pools.

Note that buffered allocation can't allocate across segment boundaries
(see :ref:`topic-allocation-point-implementation` for the technical
reason). This can cause added external fragmentation if objects are
allocated that are a significant fraction of the segment size.

.. note::

    If you need to allocate large objects in an MVFF pool,

   single: MVFF; properties

MVFF properties
---------------

* Supports allocation via :c:func:`mps_alloc`.

* Supports allocation via :term:`allocation points`. If an allocation
  point is created in an MVFF pool, the call to
  :c:func:`mps_ap_create` takes no additional parameters.

* Supports deallocation via :c:func:`mps_free`.

* Supports :term:`allocation frames` but does not use them to improve
  the efficiency of stack-like allocation.

* Supports :term:`segregated allocation caches`.

* There are no garbage collections in this pool.

* Blocks may not contain :term:`references` to blocks in automatically
  managed pools (unless these are registered as :term:`roots`).

* Allocations may be variable in size.

* The :term:`alignment` of blocks is configurable, but may not be
  smaller than the :term:`natural alignment` of the platform.

* Blocks do not have :term:`dependent objects`.

* Blocks are not automatically :term:`reclaimed`.

* Blocks are not :term:`scanned <scan>`.

* Blocks are not protected by :term:`barriers (1)`.

* Blocks do not :term:`move <moving garbage collector>`.

* Blocks may not be registered for :term:`finalization`.

* Blocks must not belong to an :term:`object format`.

MVFF interface

::

   #include "mpscmvff.h"

.. c:function:: mps_class_t mps_class_mvff(void)

    Return the :term:`pool class` for an MVFF (Manual Variable First
    Fit) :term:`pool`.

    When creating an MVFF pool, :c:func:`mps_pool_create_k` requires
    six :term:`keyword arguments`:

    * :c:macro:`MPS_KEY_EXTEND_BY` (member ``.val.size``; type
      :c:type:`size_t`) is the :term:`size` of segment that the pool
      will request from the :term:`arena`.

    * :c:macro:`MPS_KEY_MEAN_SIZE` (member ``.val.size``; type
      :c:type:`size_t`) is the predicted mean size of blocks that will
      be allocated from the pool. This is a *hint* to the MPS: the
      pool will be less efficient if this is wrong, but nothing will
      break.

    * :c:macro:`MPS_KEY_ALIGN` (member ``.val.align``; type
      :c:type:`mps_align_t`) is the :term:`alignment` of addresses for
      allocation (and freeing) in the pool. If an unaligned size is
      passed to :c:func:`mps_alloc` or :c:func:`mps_free`, it will be
      rounded up to the pool's alignment. The minimum alignment
      supported by pools of this class is ``sizeof(void *)``.

    * :c:macro:`MPS_KEY_MVFF_ARENA_HIGH` (member ``.val.b``; type
      :c:type:`mps_bool_t`) indicates whether new segments for
      buffered allocation are acquired at high addresses (if true), or
      at low addresses (if false).

    * :c:macro:`MPS_KEY_MVFF_SLOT_HIGH` (member ``.val.b``; type
      :c:type:`mps_bool_t`) is undocumented. It must have the same
      value as :c:macro:`MPS_KEY_MVFF_ARENA_HIGH`.

    * :c:macro:`MPS_KEY_MVFF_FIRST_FIT` (member ``.val.b``; type
      :c:type:`mps_bool_t`) is undocumented and must be set to true.

    For example, in :term:`C99`::

        res = mps_pool_create_k(&pool, arena, mps_class_mvff(),
               (mps_arg_s[]){{MPS_KEY_EXTEND_BY, .val.size = },
                             {MPS_KEY_MEAN_SIZE, .val.size = },
                             {MPS_KEY_ALIGN, .val.align = },
                             {MPS_KEY_MVFF_ARENA_HIGH, .val.b = 0},
                             {MPS_KEY_MVFF_SLOT_HIGH, .val.b = 0},
                             {MPS_KEY_MVFF_FIRST_FIT, .val.b = 1},
                             {MPS_KEY_ARGS_END}});

    .. deprecated:: starting with version 1.112.

        When using :c:func:`mps_pool_create`, pass the arguments like
        this::

            mps_res_t mps_pool_create(mps_pool_t *pool_o, mps_arena_t arena, 
                                      mps_class_t mps_class_mvff(),
                                      mps_size_t extend_size,
                                      mps_size_t average_size,
                                      mps_align_t alignment,
                                      mps_bool_t slot_high,
                                      mps_bool_t arena_high,
                                      mps_bool_t first_fit)


.. c:function:: mps_class_t mps_class_mvff_debug(void)

    A :ref:`debugging <topic-debugging>` version of the MVFF pool
    class.

    When creating a debugging MVFF pool, :c:func:`mps_pool_create_k`
    requires seven :term:`keyword arguments`.

    * :c:macro:`MPS_KEY_EXTEND_BY`, :c:macro:`MPS_KEY_MEAN_SIZE`,
      :c:macro:`MPS_KEY_ALIGN`, :c:macro:`MPS_KEY_MVFF_ARENA_HIGH`,
      :c:macro:`MPS_KEY_MVFF_SLOT_HIGH`, and
      :c:macro:`MPS_KEY_MVFF_FIRST_FIT` are as described above, and
      :c:macro:`MPS_KEY_POOL_DEBUG_OPTIONS` specifies the debugging
      :c:options. See :c:type:`mps_debug_option_s`.

    .. deprecated:: starting with version 1.112.

        When using :c:func:`mps_pool_create`, pass the debugging
        options, and other arguments like this::

            mps_res_t mps_pool_create(mps_pool_t *pool_o, mps_arena_t arena, 
                                      mps_class_t mps_class_mvff_debug(),
                                      mps_debug_option_s debug_option,
                                      mps_size_t extend_size,
                                      mps_size_t average_size,
                                      mps_align_t alignment,
