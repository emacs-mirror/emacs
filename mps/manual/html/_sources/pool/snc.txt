SNC (Stack No Checking)
=======================

.. deprecated:: starting with version 1.111.

    If you need special handling of stack-like allocation,
    :ref:`contact us <contact>`.

**SNC** is a :term:`manually managed <manual memory management>`
:term:`pool class` that supports a stack-like protocol for allocation
and deallocation using :term:`allocation frames` on :term:`allocation
points`. See :ref:`topic-frame`.

If :c:func:`mps_ap_frame_pop` is used on an allocation point in an SNC
pool (after a corresponding call to :c:func:`mps_ap_frame_push`), then
the objects affected by the pop are effectively declared dead, and may
be reclaimed by the collector. Extant references to such objects from
reachable or *de facto* alive objects are safe, but such other objects
should be dead; that is, such references must never be used.

SNC properties
--------------

* Does not support allocation via :c:func:`mps_alloc`.

* Supports allocation via :term:`allocation points` only. If an
  allocation point is created in an SNC pool, the call to
  :c:func:`mps_ap_create` takes no additional parameters.

* Does not support deallocation via :c:func:`mps_free`.

* Supports :term:`allocation frames`.

* Does not support :term:`segregated allocation caches`.

* Blocks may contain :term:`exact references` to blocks in the same or
  other pools (but may not contain :term:`ambiguous references` or
  :term:`weak references (1)`, and may not use :term:`remote
  references`).

* There are no garbage collections in this pool.

* Allocations may be variable in size.

* The :term:`alignment` of blocks is configurable.

* Blocks do not have :term:`dependent objects`.

* Blocks are not automatically :term:`reclaimed`.

* Blocks are :term:`scanned <scan>`.

* Blocks may only be referenced by :term:`base pointers`.

* Blocks are not protected by :term:`barriers (1)`.

* Blocks do not :term:`move <moving garbage collector>`.

* Blocks may not be registered for :term:`finalization`. A consequence
  of this is that the pool's :term:`object format` need not provide a
  :term:`forward method` or an :term:`is-forwarded method`.

* Blocks must belong to an :term:`object format`, but this may not be
  a format of variant auto-header.

SNC introspection
-----------------

::

   #include "mpscsnc.h"


.. c:function:: mps_class_t mps_class_snc(void)

    Return the :term:`pool class` for an SNC (Stack No Check)
    :term:`pool`.

    When creating an SNC pool, :c:func:`mps_pool_create` takes one
    extra argument::

        mps_res_t mps_pool_create(mps_pool_t *pool_o, mps_arena_t arena,
                                  mps_class_t mps_class_snc(),
                                  mps_fmt_t fmt)

    ``fmt`` specifies the :term:`object format` for the objects
    allocated in the pool. The format should provide at least the
    methods scan, skip, and pad.

    When creating an allocation point on an SNC pool,
    :c:func:`mps_ap_create` takes one extra argument::

        mps_res_t mps_ap_create(mps_ap_t *ap_o, mps_pool_t pool,
                                mps_rank_t rank)

    ``rank`` specifies the :term:`rank` of references in objects
    allocated on this allocation point. It must be
    :c:func:`mps_rank_exact`.
