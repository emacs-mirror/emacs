<h2>16.2. Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The MPS manages three main resources:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>storage;</li>
<li>address space;</li>
<li>time.</li>
</ol>
<p>The locus manager manages address space at the arena level.</p>
<p>When a pool wants some address space, it expresses some preferences to
the locus manager. The locus manager and the arena (working together)
try to honour these preferences, and decide what address space the
pool gets.</p>
<p>Preferences are expressed by the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SegPref</span></tt> argument to
<tt class="xref c c-func docutils literal"><span class="pre">SegAlloc()</span></tt>. Note that, when they call <tt class="xref c c-func docutils literal"><span class="pre">SegAlloc()</span></tt>, pools are
asking for address space and writeable storage simultaneously, in a
single call. There is currently no way for pools to reserve address
space without requesting storage.</p>
<div class="section" id="why-is-it-important-to-manage-address-space">
<h3>16.2.1. Why is it important to manage address space?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-is-it-important-to-manage-address-space" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Trace differentiability</p>
<p>Carefully chosen addresses are used by reference tracing systems
(ie. automatic pools), to categorise objects into clumps; and to
summarise and cheaply find references between clumps.</p>
<p>Different clumps will become worth collecting at different times
(the classic example, of course, is generations in a generational
collector). For these partial collections to be efficient, it must
be cheap to keep these clumps differentiable, cheap to condemn
(Whiten) a particular clump, and cheap to find a good conservative
approximation to all inward references to a clump (both initially
to construct the Grey set, and to make scanning the Grey set
efficient).</p>
<p>This is what the MPS zone mechanism is all about.</p>
<p>The locus manager manages the mapping from clumps to zones.</p>
<p>To specify a clump, pools use the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SegPrefGen</span></tt> argument to

<li><p class="first">Prevent address space fragmentation (within the arena)</p>
<p>Address space is not infinite.</p>
<p>In some use cases, the MPS is required to remain efficient when
using very nearly all available address space and storage. For
example, with the client-arena class, where the only address space
available is that of the storage available.</p>
<p>Even with the VM arena class, typical storage sizes (as of 2007)
can make 32-bit address space constrained: the client may need
several gigabytes, which leaves little spare address space.</p>
<p>Address space fragmentation incurs failure when there is no way to
allocate a big block of address space. The big block may be
requested via the MPS (by the client), or by something else in the
same process, such as a third-party graphics library, image
library, etc.</p>
<p>Address space fragmentation incurs cost when:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>desired large-block requests (such as for buffering) are denied,
causing them to be re-requested as a smaller block, or as several
smaller blocks;</li>
<li>possible operating-system costs in maintaining a fragmented
mapping?</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Prevent storage fragmentation (within tracts and segments)</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Storage is not infinite: it is allocated in multiples of a
fixed-size tract. Small lonely objects, each retaining a whole
tract, cause storage fragmentation.</p>
<p>Non-moving pools manage this fragmentation with placement
strategies that use:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>co-located death (in space and time);</li>
<li>segment merging and splitting.</li>
</ul>
<p>These pool-level strategies always care about contiguity of object
storage. They also often care about the <em>ordering</em> of addresses,
because pool code uses an address-ordered search when choosing
where to place a new object. For these two reasons, the address
chosen (by the locus manager and arena) for new tracts is
important.</p>
<p>Certain specialised pools, and/or some client programs that use
them, have carefully tuned segment sizes, positioning, and search
order. Be careful: seemingly inconsequential changes can
catastrophically break this tuning.</p>
<p>Pools can specify a preference for High and Low ends of address
space, which implies a search-order. Pools could also specify
clumping, using either <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SegPrefGen</span></tt> or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SegPrefZoneSet</span></tt>.</p>

<h3>16.2.2. Discovering the layout<a class="headerlink" href="#discovering-the-layout" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The locus manager is not given advance notice of how much address
space will be required with what preferences. Instead, the locus
manager starts with an empty layout, and adapts it as more requests
come in over time. It is attempting to discover a suitable layout by
successive refinement. This is ambitious.</p>

we&#8217;re particularly interested in cohorts that have properties relevant
to tract placement. It is such cohorts that the pools will try to

would be trace differentiability or (en masse) death-time

this, because we can&#8217;t devise a common measure.</p>
<p><span class="target" id="design.mps.locus.anal.stable"></span><a class="mpstag reference internal" href="#design.mps.locus.anal.stable">.anal.stable:</a> The strategy must be stable: it must avoid repeated

objects could use some locality of tract allocation, because it
increases the chances of creating large holes in the address space
(for other allocation to use). OTOH. many cohorts will not do multiple
frees in short succession, or at least cannot reasonably be predicted
to do so. This locality is not contiguity, nor is it low
fragmentation, it&#8217;s just the requirement to place the new tracts next
to the tract where the last object was allocated in the cohort. Note
that the placement of objects is under the control of the pool, and
the locus manager will not know it, therefore this requirement should
be pursued by requesting allocation next to a particular tract (which
we already have a requirement for).</p>

Each locus can be a member of a zone group, and the locus manager will
attempt to place allocations in this locus in different zones from all
the other zone groups. A zone-group is represented as &#64;&#64;&#64;&#64;.</p>
<p><span class="target" id="design.mps.locus.arch.page-table"></span><a class="mpstag reference internal" href="#design.mps.locus.arch.page-table">.arch.page-table:</a> A page table is maintained by the arena, as usual
to track association between tracts, pools and segments, and mapping
status for VM arenas.</p>
<p><span class="target" id="design.mps.locus.arch.region"></span><a class="mpstag reference internal" href="#design.mps.locus.arch.region">.arch.region:</a> All of the address space is divided into disjoint
regions, represented by region objects. These objects store their
current limits, and high and low watermarks of currently allocated
tracts (we hope there&#8217;s usually a gap of empty space between regions).
The limits are actually quite porous and flexible.</p>
<p><span class="target" id="design.mps.locus.arch.region.assoc"></span><a class="mpstag reference internal" href="#design.mps.locus.arch.region.assoc">.arch.region.assoc:</a> Each region is associated with one contiguous

any reason to stop doing do.</p>

computation are also stored in the regions and the loci. Regions are
created (and destroyed) by the placement recomputation. Regions are
located in stripes (if it&#8217;s a zoned region), but they can extend into
neighboring stripes if an exceptionally large tract allocation is
requested (to allow for large objects).</p>

space will be represented by dummy regions. There are also sentinel
regions at both ends of the address space.</p>

<p><span class="target" id="design.mps.locus.arch.strategy.delay.until"></span><a class="mpstag reference internal" href="#design.mps.locus.arch.strategy.delay.until">.arch.strategy.delay.until:</a> Hence, the locus manager only makes
placement decisions when an allocation is requested (frees and other
operations might set a flag to cause the next allocation to redecide).
This also allows the client to change the peak and pool configuration
in complicated ways without causing a lot of recomputation, by doing
all the changes without allocating in the middle (unless the control
pool needs more space because of the changes).</p>
<p><span class="target" id="design.mps.locus.arch.strategy.normal"></span><a class="mpstag reference internal" href="#design.mps.locus.arch.strategy.normal">.arch.strategy.normal:</a> While we want the placement to be
sophisticated, we do not believe it is worth the effort to consider
all the data at each allocation. Hence, allocations are usually just
placed in one of the regions used previously (see <a class="reference internal" href="#design.mps.locus.arch.alloc">.arch.alloc</a>)
without reconsidering the issues.</p>
<p><span class="target" id="design.mps.locus.arch.strategy.normal.limit"></span><a class="mpstag reference internal" href="#design.mps.locus.arch.strategy.normal.limit">.arch.strategy.normal.limit:</a> However, the manager sets

decisions are revisited when an irrevocable placement is about to be
made.</p>
<p><span class="target" id="design.mps.locus.arch.strategy.create"></span><a class="mpstag reference internal" href="#design.mps.locus.arch.strategy.create">.arch.strategy.create:</a> The manager doesn&#8217;t create new regions until
they are needed for allocation (but it might compute where they could
be placed to accommodate a peak).</p>

<p><span class="target" id="design.mps.locus.arch.alloc"></span><a class="mpstag reference internal" href="#design.mps.locus.arch.alloc">.arch.alloc:</a> Normally, each allocation to a locus is placed in its
current region. New regions are only sought when necessary to fulfill
an allocation request or when there is reason to think the situation
has changed significantly (see <a class="reference internal" href="#design.mps.locus.arch.significant">.arch.significant</a>).</p>
<p><span class="target" id="design.mps.locus.arch.alloc.same"></span><a class="mpstag reference internal" href="#design.mps.locus.arch.alloc.same">.arch.alloc.same:</a> An allocation is first attempted next to the

that is not possible, a good place in the current region is sought.
<span class="target" id="design.mps.locus.arch.alloc.same.hole"></span><a class="mpstag reference internal" href="#design.mps.locus.arch.alloc.same.hole">.arch.alloc.same.hole:</a> At the moment, for finding a good place
within a region, we just use the current algorithm, limited to the
region. In future, the placement within regions will be more clever.</p>
<p><span class="target" id="design.mps.locus.arch.alloc.extend"></span><a class="mpstag reference internal" href="#design.mps.locus.arch.alloc.extend">.arch.alloc.extend:</a> If there&#8217;s no adequate hole in the current
region and the request is not exceptional, the neighboring regions are
examined to see if the region could be extended at one border. (This
will basically only be done if the neighbor has shrunk since the last
placement recomputation, because the limit was set on sophisticated
criteria, and should not be changed without justification.)
<span class="target" id="design.mps.locus.arch.alloc.extend.here"></span><a class="mpstag reference internal" href="#design.mps.locus.arch.alloc.extend.here">.arch.alloc.extend.here:</a> When an allocation is requested next to a
specific tract (<tt class="xref c c-func docutils literal"><span class="pre">ArenaAllocHere()</span></tt>), we try to extend a little
harder (at least for <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">change_size</span></tt>, perhaps not for locality).</p>
<p><span class="target" id="design.mps.locus.arch.alloc.other"></span><a class="mpstag reference internal" href="#design.mps.locus.arch.alloc.other">.arch.alloc.other:</a> If no way can be found to allocate in the
current region, other regions used for this locus are considered in
the same way, to see if space can be found there. [Or probably look at
other regions before trying to extend anything?]</p>
<p><span class="target" id="design.mps.locus.arch.alloc.recompute"></span><a class="mpstag reference internal" href="#design.mps.locus.arch.alloc.recompute">.arch.alloc.recompute:</a> When no region of this locus has enough
space for the request, or when otherwise required, region placement is
recomputed to find a new region for the request (which might be the
same region, after extension).</p>
<p><span class="target" id="design.mps.locus.arch.alloc.current"></span><a class="mpstag reference internal" href="#design.mps.locus.arch.alloc.current">.arch.alloc.current:</a> This region where the allocation was placed
then becomes the current region for this locus, except when the

&#64;&#64;&#64;&#64;).</p>
<p><span class="target" id="design.mps.locus.arch.significant"></span><a class="mpstag reference internal" href="#design.mps.locus.arch.significant">.arch.significant:</a> Significant changes to the parameters affecting
placement are deemed to have happened at certain client calls and when
the total allocation has changed substantially since the last
recomputation. Such conditions set a flag that causes the next
allocation to recompute even if its current region is not full
(possibly second-guess the decision to recompute after some
investigation of the current state?).</p>

a sequence of alternating region cores and gaps (which can be small,

being allocated to either region, if they grow in that direction, or
one or neither, if they don&#8217;t. The set of states that the region

is not possible, keep the nearest ones in the reach and then minimize
the total distance from the rest.</p>
