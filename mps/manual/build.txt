Building the Memory Pool System
===============================

Introduction
------------

This document describes the various ways in which you can build the MPS,
its libraries, and the tests and tools that come with it.

You may be building the MPS for a number of different purposes.


Compiling the MPS for your project
----------------------------------

It is easy to compile the MPS.  You can do it separately, or include the
source in your own project's build system.  This section describes
compilation in terms of command lines, but you can equally add the files
to a project in an IDE.

The MPS also comes with Makefiles and IDE project files for building
libraries, tools, and tests.  See "Building the MPS for development".


### Compiling for production

In the simplest case, you can compile the MPS to an object file with just:

    cc -c mps.c           (Unix/Mac OS)
    cl /c mps.c           (Windows)
  
This will build a "hot" variety (for production) object file for use
with "mps.h".  You can greatly improve performance by allowing global
optimization, for example:

    cc -O2 -c mps.c       (Unix/Mac OS)
    cl /O2 /c mps.c       (Windows)


### Compiling for debugging

You can get a "cool" variety MPS (with more internal checking, for
debugging and development) with:

    cc -g -DCONFIG_VAR_COOL -c mps.c
    cl /Zi /DCONFIG_VAR_COOL /c mps.c


### Optimizing for your object format

If you are using your own object format [ref?], you will also get
improved performance by allowing the compiler to do global optimisations
between it and the MPS.  So if your format implementation is in, say,
myformat.c, then you could make a file mymps.c containing

    #include "mps.c"
    #include "myformat.c"

then

    cc -O2 -c mymps.c     (Unix/Mac OS)
    cl /O2 /c mymps.c     (Windows)

This will get your format code inlined with the MPS garbage collector.


### Compiling without the C library

If you're building the MPS for an environment without the standard C
library, you can exclude the "plinth" component of the MPS with

    cc -DCONFIG_PLINTH_NONE -c mps.c
    cl /Gs /DCONFIG_PLINTH_NONE /c mps.c

but you must then provide your own implementation of
[mpslib.h](../code/mps.h).  You can base this on the ANSI plinth in
[mpsliban.c](../code/mpsliban.c).

If you want to do anything beyond these simple cases, use the MPS build
as described in section 5.2, "Building the MPS for development".


Building the MPS for development
--------------------------------

If you're making modifications to the MPS itself, want to build MPS
libraries for linking, or want to build MPS tests and tools, you should
use the MPS build.  This uses makefiles or Xcode projects.  [Coming
soon, Microsoft Visual Studio solutions.]


### Prerequisites

For Unix-like platforms you will need the GNU Make tool.  Some platforms
(such as Linux) have GNU Make as their default make tool.  For others
you will need to get and install it.  (It's available free from
<ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/make/>.)  On FreeBSD this can be done as root
with `pkg_add -r gmake`.

On Windows platforms the NMAKE tool is used. This comes with Microsoft
Visual Studio C++ or the Microsoft Windows SDK.

On Mac OS X the MPS is built using Xcode, either by opening
[mps.xcodeproj](../code/mps.xcodeproj) with the Xcode app, or using the
command-line "xcodebuild" tool, installed from Xcode -> Preferences ->
Downloads -> Components -> Command Line Tools.


### Platforms

The MPS uses a six character platform code to express a combination of
OS/CPU architecture/compiler toolchain.  Each 6 character code breaks
down into three groups of two characters, like this:

  OSARCT

Where OS denotes the operating system, AR denotes the CPU architecture,
and CT denotes compiler toolchain.  Here are the platforms that we
have regular access to and on which the MPS works well.

    Makefile        OS          Architecture    Compiler
  
    fri3gc.gmk      FreeBSD     Intel i386      GCC
    fri6gc.gmk      FreeBSD     Intel x86_64    GCC
    lii3gc.gmk      Linux       Intel i386      GCC
    lii6gc.gmk      Linux       Intel x86_64    GCC
    mps.xcodeproj   Mac OS X    i386 + x86_64   Clang
    xci3gc.gmk      Mac OS X    i386            GCC (legacy)
    w3i3mv.nmk      Windows     Intel i386      Microsoft C
    w3i6mv.nmk      Windows     Intel x86_64    Microsoft C

Historically the MPS has worked on a much wider variety of platforms and
still could: IRIX, OSF/1 (Tru64), Solaris, SunOS, Classic Mac OS; MIPS,
PowerPC, ALPHA, SPARC v8, SPARC v9; Metrowerks Codewarrior, SunPro C,
Digital C, EGCS.  If you are interested in support on any of these
platforms or any new platforms, please contact Ravenbrook
<mps-questions@ravenbrook.com>.


### Running make

To build all MPS targets on Unix-like platforms, change to the "code"
directory and type:

    make -f <makefile>

where "make" is the command for GNU Make.  (Sometimes this will be
"gmake" or "gnumake".)

To build just one target, type:

    make -f <makefile> <target>

To build a restricted set of targets for just one variety, type:

    make -f <makefile> 'VARIETY=<variety>' <target>

For example, to build just the "cool" variety of the "amcss" test on
FreeBSD:

    gmake -f fri3gc.gmk VARIETY=cool amcss

On Windows platforms you need to run the "Visual Studio Command Prompt"
from the Start menu.  Then type:

    nmake /f w3i3mv.nmk         (32-bit)
    nmake /f w3i6mv.nmk         (64-bit)

You will need to switch your build environment between 32-bit and 64-bit
using Microsoft's `setenv` command, e.g. `setenv /x86` or `setenv /x64`.

To build just one target, type:

    nmake /f w3i3mv.nmk <target>

On Mac OS X, you can build from the command line with:

    xcodebuild

On most platforms, the output of the build goes to a directory named
after the platform (e.g. `fri3gc`) so that you can share the source tree
across platforms.  On Mac OS X the output goes in a directory called
`build`.  Building generates "mps.a" or "mps.lib" or equivalent, a
library of object code which you can link with your application, subject
to the MPS licensing conditions (see [license.txt](../license.txt).  It
also generates a number of test programs, such as "amcss" (a stress test
for the Automatic Mostly-Copying pool class) and tools such as
"eventcnv" (for decoding telemetry logs).


Installing the Memory Pool System
---------------------------------

There is currently no automatic way to "install" the MPS, such as a
`make install` command.  You can do this by copying the libraries built
by the make to, for example, `/usr/local/lib`, and all the headers
beginning with "mps" to `/usr/local/include`.
