 * Ref is an alias for Addr which can be used to document where
 * references are being passed.
 *
 * RefSet is a conservative approximation to a set of references.
 * It is conservative in the sense that if isMember returns FALSE
 * for a reference then it is guaranteed that the reference was
 * not added into the RefSet (ie, accumulating a pointer guarantees
 * that isMember will return TRUE for that reference), but the
 * converse is not true (ie isMember can return TRUE for references
 * that have not been accumulated).
 *
 * RefSets are designed to provide a very fast method for Add and
 * for IsMember.  Add is used to implement reference summaries,
 * which provide a remembered set.  IsMember is used to inline part
 * of the Fix function, and provide good discrimination of the
 * white set.  It is expected that the discrimination provided
 * will be useful for distinguishing segments and groups of segments.

 * addresses the segment occupies.
 *
 * .rsos.zones: The base and limit zones of the segment
 * are calculated.  The limit zone is one plus the zone of the last
 * address in the segment, not the zone of the limit address.
 *
 * .rsos.univ: If the segment is large enough to span all zones,
 * its reference set is universal.
 *
 * .rsos.swap: If the base zone is less than the limit zone,
 * then the reference set looks like 000111100, otherwise it looks like
 * 111000011.
