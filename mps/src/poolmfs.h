 *                    MANUAL FIXED SMALL UNIT POOL
 *
 *  $HopeName: !poolmfs.h(trunk.5) $

 *
 *  The MFS pool is used to manage small fixed-size chunks of memory.  It
 *  stores control structures in the memory it manages, rather than to one
 *  side.  It therefore achieves better locality for small objects, but
 *  wastes memory for large objects.  It should not be used unless you are
 *  packing a reasonable number of objects on to a page.
 *
 *  Create and Init take the following arguments:
 *
 *    Size extendBy
 *
 *  extendBy is the default number of bytes reserved by the pool at a time.
 *  A large size will make allocation cheaper but have a higher resource
 *  overhead.  A typical value might be 65536.  See note 2.
 *
 *    Size unitSize
 *
 *  unitSize is the size in bytes of the objects you with to allocate.  It
 *  must be larger than the minimum unit size returned by GetInfo, and not
 *  larger than extendBy.
