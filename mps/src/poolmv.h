/*  ==== MANUAL VARIABLE POOLS ====

 *
 *  This is the interface to the manual-variable pool class.
 *  Manual-variable pools manage variably-sized blocks of memory in a
 *  flexible manner.  They have higher overheads than a fixed-size pool.
 *
 *  This class adds the following arguments to PoolCreate:
 *
 *    Size extendBy
 *
 *  extendBy is the default number of bytes reserved by the pool at a time.
 *  A large size will make allocation cheaper but have a higher resource
 *  overhead.  A typical value might be 65536.  See note 2.
 *
 *    Size avgSize
 *
 *  avgSize is an estimate of the average size of an allocation, and is used
 *  to choose the size of internal tables.  An accurate estimate will
 *  improve the efficiency of the pool.  A low estimate will make the pool
 *  less space efficient.  A high estimate will make the pool less time
 *  efficient.  A typical value might be 32.  avgSize must not be less than
 *  extendBy.
 *
 *    Size maxSize
 *
 *  maxSize is an estimate of the maximum total size that the pool will
 *  reach.  Setting this parameter does not actually contrain the pool, but
 *  an accurate estimate will improve the efficiency of the pool.  maxSize
 *  must not be less than extendBy.
 *
 *  The size parameter to PoolAllocP can be any non-zero size.
 *
 *  PoolAllocH is not supported by this class.
 *
 *  Notes
 *   2. The documentation could suggest a segment size according to the
 *      distribution of allocation size requests.  richard 1994-11-08
