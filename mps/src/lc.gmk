# This file is included by platform makefiles that use the LCC
# compiler.  It defines the compiler specific variables that the
# common makefile fragment (impl.gmk.comm) requires.
#
# .optimize.noflags: lcc does some minimal amount of optimization all
# the time and ignores the -O flag.  Hence the empty *OPT* macros.

# We need a symbol for a non-empty definition with empty value
