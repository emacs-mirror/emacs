/* impl.c.ring: RING IMPLEMENTATION

 *
 * .def: Rings are circular doubly-linked lists of ring "nodes".  The nodes
 * are fields of structures which are the "elements" of the ring.
 *
 * .ex: For example:
 *
 *   typedef struct FooStruct *Foo;	the element type
 *   typedef struct FooStruct {		the element structure
 *     int baz, bim;
 *     RingStruct ring;			the ring node
 *     float bip, bop;
 *   } FooStruct;
 *
 * .def.singleton: A "singleton" ring is a ring containing one node, whose
 * previous and next nodes are itself.
 *
 * .rationale: Because ring nodes are in-lined in their parent
 * structures the do not need to be managed.  This is especially useful
 * in avoiding re-entrancy and bootstrapping problems in the memory
 * manager.  Rings also provide flexible insertion and deletion because
 * the entire ring can be found from any node.
 *
 * .where.type: The Ring type is defined in impl.h.mpmtypes.
 * .where.struct: The RingStruct structure is defined in impl.h.mpmst.
