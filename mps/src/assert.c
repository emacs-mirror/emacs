/* impl.c.assert: ASSERTION IMPLEMENTATION
 *
 * $HopeName: MMsrc!assert.c(trunk.6) $
 *
 * This source provides the AssertFail function which is
 * invoked by the assertion macros (see impl.h.assert).
 * It also provides for user-installed assertion failure handlers.
 *
 * Notes
 *
 * 3. To be really solid, assert should write the information into a
 * buffer before reaching the handler, so that it can be recovered
 * even if printing fails.  richard 1994-11-15
