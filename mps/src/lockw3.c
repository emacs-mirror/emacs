 *
 *  These are implemented using critical sections.
 *  See the section titled "Synchronization functions" in the Groups
 *  chapter of the Microsoft Win32 API Programmer's Reference.
 *  The "Synchronization" section of the Overview is also relevant.
 *
 *  Critical sections support recursive locking, so the implementation
 *  could be trivial.  This implementation counts the claims to provide
 *  extra checking.
 *
 *  The limit on the number of recursive claims is the max of
 *  ULONG_MAX and the limit imposed by critical sections, which
 *  is believed to be about UCHAR_MAX.
 *
 *  During use the claims field is updated to remember the number of
 *  claims acquired on a lock.  This field must only be modified
 *  while we are inside the critical section.
