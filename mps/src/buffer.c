 * This is (part of) the implementation of allocation buffers.
 *
 * Several macros which also form part of the implementation are
 * in impl.h.mps.
 *
 * Several macros forming part of impl.h.mps should be consistent
 * with the macros and functions in this module.
 *
 * Declarations for functions defined here are in impl.h.mpm.
 *
 * Declarations for the relevant structures are in impl.h.mpmst.
 *
 * DESIGN
 *
 * See design.mps.buffer.
 *
 * TRANSGRESSIONS
 *
 * .trans.mod: There are several instances where pool structures are
 * directly accessed by this module (because impl.c.pool does not
 * provide an adequate (or adequately documented) interface.  They
 * bear this tag.

 *
 * BufferIsReset returns TRUE if and only if the buffer is in the
 * reset state, i.e.  with base, init, alloc, and limit set to zero.
 *
 * BufferIsReady returns TRUE iff the buffer is not between a
 * reserve and commit.  The result is only reliable if the client is
 * not currently using the buffer, since it may update the alloc and
 * init pointers asynchronously.
 *
 * BufferAP returns the APStruct substructure of a buffer.
 *
 * BufferOfAP is a thread-safe (design.mps.interface.c.thread-safety)
 * method of getting the buffer which owns an APStruct.
 *
 * BufferSpace is a thread-safe (design.mps.interface.c.thread-safety)
 * method of getting the space which owns a buffer.
 *
 * BufferPool returns the pool to which a buffer is attached.
