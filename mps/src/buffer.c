/* impl.c.buffer: ALLOCATION BUFFER IMPLEMENTATION

 *
 * This is the interface to allocation buffers.
 *
 * An allocation buffer is an interface to a pool which provides
 * very fast allocation, and defers the need for synchronization in
 * a multi-threaded environment.
 *
 * Pools which contain formatted objects must be synchronized so
 * that the pool can know when an object is valid.  Allocation from
 * such pools is done in two stages: reserve and commit.  The client
 * first reserves memory, then initializes it, then commits.
 * Committing the memory declares that it contains a valid formatted
 * object.  Under certain conditions, some pools may cause the
 * commit operation to fail.  (See the documentation for the pool.)
 * Failure to commit indicates that the whole allocation failed and
 * must be restarted.  When a pool with commit failure, the
 * allocation sequence could look something like this:
 *
 * do {
 *   res = BufferReserve(&p, buffer, size);
 *   if(res != ResOK) return res;       // allocation fails, reason res
 *   initialize(p);                     // p now points at valid object
 * } while(!BufferCommit(buffer, p, size));
 *
 * Pools which do not contain formatted objects can use a one-step
 * allocation as usual.  Effectively any random rubbish counts as a
 * "valid object" to such pools.
 *
 * An allocation buffer is an area of memory which is pre-allocated
 * from a pool, plus a buffer descriptor, which contains, inter
 * alia, four pointers: base, init, alloc, and limit.  Base points
 * to the base address of the area, limit to the last address plus
 * one.  Init points to the first uninitialized address in the
 * buffer, and alloc points to the first unallocated address.
 *
 *    L . - - - - - .
 *      |           |
 *      |   junk    |
 *      |           |       the "busy" state, after Reserve
 *    A |-----------|
 *      |  uninit   |
 *    I |-----------|
 *      |   init    |
 *      |           |
 *    B `-----------'
 *
 *    L . - - - - - .
 *      |           |
 *      |   junk    |
 *      |           |       the "ready" state, after Commit
 *  A=I |-----------|
 *      |           |
 *      |           |
 *      |   init    |
 *      |           |
 *    B `-----------'
 *
 * Access to these pointers is restricted in order to allow
 * synchronization between the pool and the client.  The client may
 * only write to init and alloc, but in a restricted and atomic way
 * detailed below.  The pool may read the contents of the buffer
 * descriptor at _any_ time.  During calls to the fill and trip
 * methods, the pool may update any or all of the fields
 * in the buffer descriptor.  The pool may update the limit at _any_
 * time.
 *
 * Only one thread may use a buffer at once, unless the client
 * places a mutual exclusion around the buffer access in the usual
 * way.  In such cases it is usually better to create one buffer for
 * each thread.
 *
 * Here are pseudo-code descriptions of the reserve and commit
 * operations.  These may be implemented in-line by the client.
 * Note that the client is responsible for ensuring that the size
 * (and therefore the alloc and init pointers) are aligned according
 * to the buffer's alignment.
 *
 * Reserve(buf, size)                   ; size must be aligned to pool
 *   if buf->limit - buf->alloc >= size then
 *     buf->alloc +=size                ; must be atomic update
 *     p = buf->init
 *   else
 *     res = BufferFill(&p, buf, size)  ; buf contents may change
 *
 * Commit(buf, p, size)
 *   buf->init = buf->alloc             ; must be atomic update
 *   if buf->limit == 0 then
 *     b = BufferTrip(buf, p, size)     ; buf contents may change
 *
 * The pool must allocate the buffer descriptor and initialize it by
 * calling BufferInit.  The descriptor this creates will fall
 * through to the fill method on the first allocation.  In general,
 * pools should not assign resources to the buffer until the first
 * allocation, since the buffer may never be used.
 *
 * The pool may update the base, init, alloc, and limit fields when
 * the fallback methods are called.  In addition, the pool may set
 * the limit to zero at any time.  The effect of this is either:
 *
 *   1. cause the _next_ allocation in the buffer to fall through to
 *      the buffer fill method, and allow the buffer to be flushed
 *      and relocated;
 *
 *   2. cause the buffer trip method to be called if the client was
 *      between reserve and commit.
 *
 * A buffer may not be relocated under other circumstances because
 * there is a race between updating the descriptor and the client
 * allocation sequence.
