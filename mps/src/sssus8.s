!  changed in parallel.
!
!  The non-global registers are preserved into the stackframe
!  by the "ta 3" instruction.  This leaves the global registers.
!  According to the Sparc Architecture Manual:
!  %g1 is assumed to be volatile across procedure calls
!  %g2...%g4 are "reserved for use by application programmer"
!  %g5...%g7 are "nonvolatile and reserved for (as-yet-undefined)
!     use by the execution environment"
!  To be safe %g2 to %g7 are pushed onto the stack before scanning
!  it just in case.
