# This file was created using the cxref tool supplied with the
# Sun Pro C compilation system on a Solaris 2.x system (lizard)
# (see pkginfo SPROcc).
#
# The options may be different for other vendors' cxref, then again
# it may be the same.


# We need a symbol for a non-empty definition with empty value
