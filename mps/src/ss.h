/*  == StackScan ==
 *  
 *  StackScan scans the current stack between the 
 *  stackBot and the current top of stack. It also fixes
 *  any roots which may be in registers.
 *  
 *  See the specific implementation for the exact registers which
 *  are scanned.
 *
 *  The word pointed to by stackBot is fixed if the stack
 *  is by convention empty, and not fixed if it is full.
 *  Where empty means sp points to first free word beyond the top of
 *  stack.  Full means sp points to the top of stack itself.
