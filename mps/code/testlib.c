/* rnd -- a random number generator
 *
 * We use the (Multiplicative) Linear Congruential Generator
 *   Xn = a * Xn-1 mod m
 * with: m = 2147483647 (2^31 - 1, a Mersenne prime), and a = 48271.  
 * This is a 'full-period' generator: all values in [1..(mod-1)] 
 * (ie. 0x00000001 to 0x7ffffffe inclusive) are returned once, and then 
 * the cycle begins again.  The value 0 is not part of the cycle and 
 * is never returned.  So the period = mod-1, ie. 2147483646.
 *
 * This generator is extremely simple and has been very well studied.  
 * It is free of major vices we might care about for this application.
 * In particular, as m is prime, low order bits are random.  Therefore 
 * to roll an N-sided die (N << m), "rnd() % N" is acceptable, giving 
 * a value in [0..N-1].
 *
 * It was popularised by the much-cited Park & Miller paper:
 *   Stephen K Park & Keith W Miller (1988). Random number generators:
 *   good ones are hard to find.  Communications of the ACM, 
 *   31:1192-1201.
 * The recommended multiplier a was later updated from 16807 to 48271:
 *   Stephen K Park, Keith W Miller, Paul K. Stockmeyer (1993). 
 *   Technical Correspondence.  Communications of the ACM, 36:105-110.
 *
 * (Many more elaborate generators have been invented.  The next simple 
 * step would be to combine with the MLCG m = 2147483399 a = 40692, to 
 * make the period "about 74 quadrillion".  See the summary of chapter 
 * 3 in Knuth's "The Art of Computer Programming".)
 *
 * This (fast) implementation uses the identity:
 *   0x80000000 == 0x7FFFFFFF + 0x00000001
 * noted by David Carta (1990), where 0x7FFFFFFF == 2^31-1 == m, which 
 * means that bits above the first 31 can simply be shifted >> 31 and 
 * added, preserving Xn mod m.  To remain within 32-bit unsigned 
 * arithmetic when multiplying the previous seed (31 bits) by a (16 
 * bits), the seed is split into bottom and top halves; bits above 
 * the first 31 are simply "top >> 16".  (Code by RHSK, inspired by 
 * Robin Whittle's article at "http://www.firstpr.com.au/dsp/rand31/").
 *
 * Slower implementations, used for verification:
 * rnd_verify_schrage uses the method of L. Schrage (1979 & 1983), 
 *   namely splitting the seed by q, where q = m div a.
 * rnd_verify_float simply uses floating point arithmetic.
