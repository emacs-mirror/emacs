 *                            mps_class_t mvt_class,

 *                            mps_count_t fragmentation_limit);
 * minimum_, mean_, and maximum_size are the mimimum, mean, and
 * maximum (typical) size of objects expected to be allocated in the
 * pool.  reserve_depth is a measure of the expected hysteresis of the
 * object population.  fragmentation_limit is a percentage (between 0
 * and 100):  if the free space managed by the pool exceeds the
 * specified percentage, the pool will resort to a "first fit"
 * allocation policy.
