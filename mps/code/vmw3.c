/* vmw3.c: VIRTUAL MEMORY MAPPING FOR WIN32
 *
 * $Id$
 * Copyright (c) 2001 Ravenbrook Limited.  See end of file for license.
 *
 * .design: See <design/vm/>.
 *
 * .purpose: This is the implementation of the virtual memory mapping
 * interface (vm.h) for Win32s.
 *
 *  The documentation for Win32 used is the "Win32 Programmer's Reference"
 *  provided with Microsoft Visual C++ 2.0.
 *
 *  VirtualAlloc is used to reserve address space and to "commit" (map)
 *  address ranges onto storage.  VirtualFree is used to release and
 *  "decommit" (unmap) pages.  These functions are documented in the
 *  Win32 SDK help, under System Services/Memory Management.
 *
 *  .assume.free.success:  We assume that VirtualFree will never return
 *    an error; this is because we always pass in legal parameters
 *    (hopefully).
 *
 *  .assume.not-last:  We assume that VirtualAlloc will never return
 *    a block of memory that occupies the last page in memory, so
 *    that limit is representable and bigger than base.
 *
 *  .assume.lpvoid-addr:  We assume that the windows type LPVOID and
 *    the MM type Addr are assignment-compatible.
 *
 *  .assume.sysalign: We assume that the page size on the system
 *    is a power of two.
 *
 *  Notes
 *   1. GetSystemInfo returns a thing called szAllocationGranularity
 *      the purpose of which is unclear but which might affect the
 *      reservation of address space.  Experimentally, it does not.
 *      Microsoft's documentation is extremely unclear on this point.
