/* vmix.c: VIRTUAL MEMORY MAPPING FOR UNIX (ISH)
 *
 * $Id$
 * Copyright (c) 2001,2007 Ravenbrook Limited.  See end of file for license.
 *
 * .purpose: This is the implementation of the virtual memory mapping
 * interface (vm.h) for Unix-like operating systems.  It was created
 * by copying vmfr.c (the FreeBSD) implementation (as that seemed to
 * use the most standards conforming interfaces).  vmfr.c was itself
 * copied from vli.c (Linux) which was itself copied from vmo1.c (OSF/1
 * / DIGITAL UNIX / Tru64).
 *
 * .deployed: Currently used on Darwin (OS X) and FreeBSD.
 *
 * .design: See <design/vm/>.  .design.mmap: mmap(2) is used to
 * reserve address space by creating a mapping with page access none.
 * mmap(2) is used to map pages onto store by creating a copy-on-write
 * (MAP_PRIVATE) mapping with the flag MAP_ANON.
 *
 * .non-standard: Note that the MAP_ANON flag is non-standard; it is
 * available on Darwin and FreeBSD.  .non-standard.linux: Linux
 * seems to use MAP_ANONYMOUS instead.  Some Linux systems make MAP_ANON
 * available and deprecate it.  .non-standard.sesame: On Linux getting
 * a definition of MAP_ANON requires a macro to be defined prior to
 * <sys/mman.h>.
 *
 * .assume.not-last: The implementation of VMCreate assumes that
 * mmap() will not choose a region which contains the last page
 * in the address space, so that the limit of the mapped area
 * is representable.
 *
 * .assume.mmap.err: ENOMEM is the only error we really expect to
 * get from mmap.  The others are either caused by invalid params
 * or features we don't use.  See mmap(2) for details.
 *
 * .remap: Possibly this should use mremap to reduce the number of
 * distinct mappings.  According to our current testing, it doesn't
 * seem to be a problem.
