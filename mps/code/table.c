/* TableHash -- return a hash value from an address
 *
 * This uses a single cycle of an MLCG, more commonly seen as a 
 * pseudorandom number generator.  It works extremely well as a 
 * hash function.
 *
 * (In particular, it is substantially better than simply doing this:
 *   seed = (unsigned long)addr * 48271;
 * Tested by RHSK 2010-12-28.)
 *
 * This MLCG is a full period generator: it cycles through every 
 * number from 1 to m-1 before repeating.  Therefore, no two numbers 
 * in that range hash to the same value.  Furthermore, it has prime 
 * modulus, which tends to avoid recurring patterns in the low-order 
 * bits, which is good because the hash will be used modulus the 
 * number of slots in the table.
 *
 * Of course it's only a 31-bit cycle, so we start by losing the top 
 * bit of the address, but that's hardly a great problem.
 *
 * The implementation is quite subtle.  See rnd() in testlib.c, where 
 * it has been exhaustively (ie: totally) tested.  RHSK 2010-12-28.
 *
 * TODO: Check how this works out on 64-bit. RB 2012-09-04

 * If insufficient memory, return error without modifying table.
 *
 * .hash.spacefraction: As with all closed hash tables, we must choose 
 * an appropriate proportion of slots to remain free.  More free slots 
 * help avoid large-sized contiguous clumps of full cells and their 
 * associated linear search costs. 
 *
 * .hash.initial: Any reasonable number.
 *
 * .hash.growth: A compromise between space inefficency (growing bigger 
 * than required) and time inefficiency (growing too slowly, with all 
 * the rehash costs at every step).  A factor of 2 means that at the 
 * point of growing to a size X table, hash-work equivalent to filling 
 * a size-X table has already been done.  So we do at most 2x the 
 * hash-work we would have done if we had been able to guess the right 
 * table size initially.
 *
 * Numbers of slots maintain this relation:
 *     occupancy <= capacity < enough <= cSlots
