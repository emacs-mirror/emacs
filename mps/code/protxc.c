/* protxc.c: PROTECTION EXCEPTION HANDLER FOR OS X MACH
 *
 * $Id$
 * Copyright (c) 2013 Ravenbrook Limited.  See end of file for license.
 *
 * This is the protection exception handling code for OS X using the
 * Mach interface (not pthreads).
 *
 * In Mach, a thread that hits protected memory is suspended, and a message
 * is sent to a separate handler thread.
 *
 * The handler thread can fix things up and continue the suspended thread by
 * sending back a "success" reply.  It can forward the message to another
 * handler of the same kind, or it can forward the message to another handler
 * at the next level out (the levels are thread, task, host) by sending a
 * "fail" reply.
 *
 * In OS X, pthreads are implemented by Mach threads. (The implementation is
 * part of the XNU source code at opensource.apple.com. [copy to import?]) So
 * we can use some pthread interfaces (pthread_create, pthread_once) for
 * convenience in setting up threads.
 *
 * This module sets up an exception handling thread for the EXC_BAD_ACCESS
 * exceptions that will be caused by the MPS shield (read/write barriers).
 * That thread calls the MPS to resolve the condition and allow the mutator
 * thread to progress.

 * TRANSGRESSIONS
 *
 * .trans.stdlib: It's OK to use the C library from here because we know
 * we're on OS X and not freestanding.  In particular, we use memcpy.
 *
 * .trans.must: Various OS calls are asserted to succeed, since there isn't
 * really a dynamic reason they should fail, so it must be a static error.
 * In a RASH build, they don't stop the program, just in case it's able to
 * limp along.

 *
 * OS X provides a function exc_server (in

 * sources <http://www.opensource.apple.com/source/xnu/xnu-2050.22.13/osfmk/man/exc_server.html>
 * and generated by the Mach Interface Generator (mig).  It unpacks
 * an exception message structure and calls one of several handler functions.
 * We can't use it because:
 *
 *   1. It's hard-wired to call certain functions by name.  The MPS can't
 *      steal those names in case the client program is using them too.
 *
 *   2. It fails anyway in Xcode's default "Release" build with hidden
 *      symbols, because it uses dlsym to find those handler functions, and
 *      dlsym can't find them.
 *
 * So instead this function duplicates the work of exc_server, and is shorter
 * because it's specialised for protection exceptions of a single behaviour
 * and flavour.  It is also more flexible and can dispatch to any function
 * we want.  The downside is that it depends on various unpublished stuff
 * like the code numbers for certain messages.
