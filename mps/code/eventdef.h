 * TRANSGRESSIONS
 *
 * .kind.abuse: A few events have a kind which is not obvious from the
 * type of the objects that the event relates to.  They are given the
 * kind that that have on the grounds of expected use.  The kinds are
 * used in controlling the overall volume of telemetry and these events are
 * given kinds so that they are grouped under the same control as events
 * you are likely to want to see them with.  (So for example, lots of
 * scanner events have the same kind, Seg, because if you are interested
 * in one then you're probably interested in them all and it's a similar
 * amount of data).

 * These specify:
 *   - Type: The name of the event type, without the leading "Event";
 *   - Code: The unique 16-bit code associated with this event type;
 *   - Always: Whether this event type should appear in optimised
 *     varieties, not currently used;
 *   - Kind: Category into which this event falls, without the
 *     leading "EventKind";
 *   - Parameter Count
 *   - Format: Tuple indicating the format of the event
 *     parameters, similar to writef (Pointer, Addr, Word, Unsigned,
 *     String, Double).
