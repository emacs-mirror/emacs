Eventual Aim: auto-flip, no re-use, auto-detect Ra

1. Manual flip, manually detect that object has moved.
  - manual client-request flip: condemns everything;
    -- no ambig
  - detect: try in sequence:
    -- try access stale, see if it faults;
    -- 

( 2. Does Ra auto-detect on w3i3mv? )


3. Auto flip every time, manual detect.  Mac OS


4. Then things from this list:
Flip trigger: more triggers, not every time, markers, ...
No re-use
Protect white (unless it already is).
Multiflips, ...

Other investigations:

Why does R0, Ra, etc not fault on Mac OS X?

Does mutator access to white objs fault?  On which platforms?
