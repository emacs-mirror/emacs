# This file is included by platform makefiles that use the Digital C
# compiler.
#
# Options are derived from man cc on schiele
#
# There is a potentially useful option -check
# Unfortunately it produces warnings about non casting printf to void
# and bogus warnings about non-void functions not having a return statement
# as the last statement.  We would need to cleam our code in order to use
# the option.
