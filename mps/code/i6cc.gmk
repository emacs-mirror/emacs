# This file is included by platform makefiles that use the IRIX 6 CC
# compiler.  It defines the compiler specific variables that the
# common makefile fragment (impl.gmk.comm) requires.


CC = cc


# suppress error(1174): function "foo" was declared but never referenced
#   because it happens with vfork in <unistd.h> included from vmi5.c
# suppress error(1196): function declared implicitly
#   because it happens with __vfork in <unistd.h> included from vmi5.c
# suppress remark(1209): 'controlling expression is constant'
#   because it occurs in 'while(0)' and statically determined checks
# suppress remark(1552): 'variable "foo" was set but never used'
#   (e.g. variables only used in asserts)
# can't use -pedantic because Irix header files have #ident
