 *
 * This contains the callee-save registers and the stack pointer.
 *
 * This is used to save the registers after or on entry to the arena so that
 * they can be scanned.

/* STACK_CONTEXT_SAVE - save the callee-saves and stack pointer
 * 
 * This macro saves the callee-saves and stack pointer for the
 * current function into the passed StackContext.  The StackContext
 * is no longer valid after the function returns.
 *
 * This needs to be a macro because the compiler may need to do
 * setjmp magic.

 * 
 * We assume the stack is full.  In other words the stack top points at
 * a word that contains a potential Ref.
