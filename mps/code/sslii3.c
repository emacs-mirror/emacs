/* impl.c.sslii3: LINUX/INTEL STACK SCANNING
 *
 * $HopeName: MMsrc!sslii3.c(trunk.1) $
 * Copyright (C) 1999.  Harlequin Group plc.  All rights reserved.
 *
 *  This scans the stack and fixes the registers which may contain 
 *  roots.  See design.mps.thread-manager
 *
 *  The registers edi, esi, ebx are the registers defined to be preserved
 *  across function calls and therefore may contain roots.
 *  These are pushed on the stack for scanning.
 *
 * SOURCES
 *
 * .source.callees.saves: Set of callee-saved registers taken from
 * CALL_USED_REGISTERS in <gcc-sources>/config/i386/i386.h.
 *
 * ASSUMPTIONS
 *
 * .assume.align: The stack pointer is assumed to be aligned on a word
 * boundary.
 *
 * .assume.asm.stack: The compiler must not do wacky things with the
 * stack pointer around a call since we need to ensure that the
 * callee-save regs are visible during TraceScanArea.
 *
 * .assume.asm.order: The volatile modifier should prevent movement
 * of code, which might break .assume.asm.stack.
 *
