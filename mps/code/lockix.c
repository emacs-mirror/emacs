 *
 * .posix: The implementation uses a POSIX interface, and should be reusable
 * for many Unix-like operating systems.
 *
 * .freebsd: This implementation supports FreeBSD (platform
 * MPS_OS_FR).
 *
 * .darwin: This implementation supports Darwin (OS X) (platform
 * MPS_OS_XC).
 *
 * .design: These locks are implemented using mutexes.
 *
 * .recursive: Mutexes support both non-recursive and recursive
 * locking, but only at initialization time.  This doesn't match the
 * API of MPS Lock module, which chooses at locking time, so all locks
 * are made (non-recursive) errorchecking.  Recursive locks are
 * implemented by checking the error code.
 *
 * .claims: During use the claims field is updated to remember the
 * number of claims acquired on a lock.  This field must only be
 * modified while we hold the mutex.
 *
 * .from: This was copied from the FreeBSD implementation (lockfr.c)
 * which was itself a cleaner version of the LinuxThreads
 * implementation (lockli.c).
