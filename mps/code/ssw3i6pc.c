/* ssw3i6pc.c: STACK SCANNING FOR WIN64 WITH PELLES C

 * This scans the stack and fixes the registers which may contain roots.
 * See <design/thread-manager/>.
 *
 * .assume.ms-compat: We rely on the fact that Pelles C's setjmp stores
 * the callee-save registers in the jmp_buf and is compatible with Microsoft
 * C.  The Pelles C 7.00 setjmp.h header has a comment "MS compatible".  See
 * also "Is Pelles C's jmp_buf compatible with Microsoft C's?"
