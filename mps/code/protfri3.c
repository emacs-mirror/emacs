/* sigHandle -- protection signal handler
 *
 *  This is the signal handler installed by ProtSetup to deal with
 *  protection faults.  It is installed on the SIGBUS signal.  It
 *  decodes the protection fault details from the signal context and
 *  passes them to ArenaAccess, which attempts to handle the fault and
 *  remove its cause.  If the fault is handled, then the handler
 *  returns and execution resumes.  If it isn't handled, then
 *  sigHandle does its best to pass the signal on to the previously
 *  installed signal handler (sigNext).
 *
 *  .sigh.args: The sigaction manual page .source.man documents three
 *  different handler prototypes: ANSI C sa_handler, traditional BSD
 *  sa_handler, and POSIX SA_SIGINFO sa_sigaction.  The ANSI C
 *  prototype isn't powerful enough for us (can't get addresses), and
 *  the manual page deprecates the BSD sa_handler in favour of the
 *  POSIX SA_SIGINFO sa_sigaction.  In that prototype, the arguments
 *  are: signal number, pointer to signal info structure, pointer to
 *  signal context structure.
 *
 *  .sigh.context: We only know how to handle signals with code
 *  BUS_PAGE_FAULT, where info->si_addr gives the fault address.
 *
 *  .sigh.mode: The fault type (read/write) does not appear to be
 *  available to the signal handler (see mail archive).

 *

 *  handler on SIGBUS to catch and handle page faults (see
 *  sigHandle).  The previous handler is recorded so that it can be
 *  reached from sigHandle if it fails to handle the fault.
 *
 *  NOTE: There are problems with this approach:
 *    1. we can't honor the sa_flags for the previous handler,
 *    2. what if this thread is suspended just after calling signal(3)?
 *       The sigNext variable will never be initialized!  */
