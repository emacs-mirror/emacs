 * Copyright (C) 2014 Ravenbrook Limited.  See end of file for license.
 *
 * Simple binary trees with utilities, for use as building blocks.
 * Keep it simple, like Rings (see ring.h).
 *
 * The performance requirements on tree implementation will depend on
 * how each individual function is applied in the MPS.
 *
 * .note.stack: It's important that the MPS have a bounded stack
 * size, and this is a problem for tree algorithms.  Basically,
 * we have to avoid recursion.  TODO: Design documentation for this
 * requirement, meanwhile see job003651 and job003640.
