/* protix.c: PROTECTION FOR UNIX
 *
 *  $Id$
 *  Copyright (c) 2001,2007 Ravenbrook Limited.  See end of file for license.
 *
 *  Somewhat generic across different Unix systems.  Shared between
 *  Darwin (OS X), OSF/1 (DIGITAL UNIX), and FreeBSD.
 *
 *  May not actually work on OSF/1 due to lack of available machines.
 *
 *  This file does not contain a signal handler.  That's in protsgix.c
 *  (for FreeBSD and Darwin on Intel); in protxcpp.c (for Darwin on
 *  PowerPC).
