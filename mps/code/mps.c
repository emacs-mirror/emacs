 *
 * .purpose: This file can be compiled to create the complete MPS library in
 * a single compilation, allowing the compiler to apply global optimizations
 * and inlining effectively.  On most modern compilers this is also faster
 * than compiling each file separately.
 *
 * .purpose.universal: This file also allows simple building of a Mac OS X
 * "universal" (multiple architecture) binary when the set of source files
 * differs by architecture.  It may work for other platforms in a similar
 * manner.
 *
 * .rule.simple: This file should never be more than a simple list of
 * includes of other source code, with ifdefs for platform configuration,
 * which closely mirror those in the makefiles.
