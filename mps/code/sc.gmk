# impl.gmk.sc: GNUMAKEFILE FRAGMENT FOR SunPro C
#
# $Id$
#
# This file is included by platform makefiles that use the SunPro C
# compiler.  It defines the compiler specific variables that the
# common makefile fragment (impl.gmk.comm) requires.  See builder.sc for
# discussion of the various flags.

# if cc isn't on your PATH, try looking in /opt/SUNWspro/bin and
# /opt/SUNWspro/SC*/bin
