/* lockli.c: RECURSIVE LOCKS FOR POSIX SYSTEMS

 *
 * .linux: This implementation currently just supports LinuxThreads
 * (platform MPS_OS_LI), Single Unix i/f.
 *
 * .posix: In fact, the implementation should be reusable for most POSIX
 * implementations, but may need some customization for each.
 *
 * .design: These locks are implemented using mutexes.
 *
 * .recursive: Mutexes support both non-recursive and recursive locking, but
 * only at initialization time.  This doesn't match the API of MPS Lock module,
 * which chooses at locking time, so all locks are made (non-recursive)
 * errorchecking.  Recursive locks are implemented by checking the error
 * code.
 *
 * .claims: During use the claims field is updated to remember the number of
 * claims acquired on a lock.  This field must only be modified
 * while we hold the mutex.
