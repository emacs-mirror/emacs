/* lock.h: RECURSIVE LOCKS

 *
 * .description: [@@@@ Should be combined with <design/lock/>]
 *  This defines the type Lock, which supports simple recursive
 *  locking.  Locking ensures that only a single thread may be running
 *  with a lock held.  By claiming a lock in some code, this ensures
 *  that only one thread can be running in that code at a time.  This
 *  in turn can be used to protect different threads from trying to
 *  read or update data structures which are in a transitional state.
 *
 *  At most one thread may own a lock at a time.  A lock is initialised
 *  without an owner.  A lock should not have an owner when it is
 *  finished.  Claiming the lock will wait until the lock is not owned
 *  by another thread and then cause the current thread to become the
 *  owner.  Releasing the the lock will relinquish ownership if the
 *  number of releases matches the number of claims.
 *
 *  To use a lock a structure of type LockStruct must be allocated.
 *  This is defined in <code/lockst.h>.  Sources which allocate such a
 *  structure will need to include "lockst.h".  A lock of type Lock is
 *  a pointer to such an allocated structure.
 *
 *  A lock must be Inited before use and should be Finished after use,
 *  using LockInit and LockFinish.
 *
 *  LockClaimRecursive & LockReleaseRecursive are for claiming and
 *  releasing the lock.  These may be used recursively.
 *
 *  There is a limit on the number of recursive claims which
 *  depends on the implementation.  See issue.lock-claim-limit.
 *
 *  LockClaim and LockReleaseMPM are the same as the Recursive versions,
 *  except that LockClaim may only be used by a thread that doesn't
 *  already own the lock, and LockReleaseMPM may only be used to release
 *  a lock with one claim.  LockClaim and LockReleaseMPM if used, must
 *  be used symmetrically in pairs.
 *
 *  There are two intended uses.  Here is an example:
 *  #include "lock.h"
 *  #include "lockst.h"
 *  static LockStruct lockStruct;
 *  binaryUse()
 *  { ;; lock not owned by this thread.
 *    LockClaim(&lockStruct);
 *    ;; lock owned by this thread.
 *    ;; Cannot call binaryUse() at this point.
 *    ;; only one thread at a time may be at this point.
 *    LockReleaseMPM(&lockStruct);
 *    ;; lock not owned by this thread.
 *  }
 *
 *  recursiveUse()
 *  { ;; lock may already be owned by this thread.
 *    LockClaimRecursive(&lockStruct);
 *    ;; lock held by this thread.
 *    ;; only one thread at a time may be at this point.
 *    LockReleaseRecursive(&lockStruct);
 *    ;; lock owned by this thread if it was before.
 *  }
 *  LockInit(&lockStruct) must be called before calling binaryUse()
 *  or recursiveUse().
 *  LockFinish(&lockStruct) should be called when lock is no longer
 *  needed.
 *  recursiveUse() may be called by both functions.
 *  binaryUse() may only be called where lock is known not to be
 *  already owned by this thread.  In particular, it may not be
 *  called by recursiveUse().
 *
 *  LockClaimGlobalRecursive & LockReleaseGlobalRecursive are
 *  similar to LockClaimRecursive & LockReleaseRecursive
 *  except that they lock an implicit global lock. This may be
 *  used for locking access to data structures which are global,
 *  such as class objects.
