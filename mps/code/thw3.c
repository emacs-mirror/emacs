/* thw3i3.c: WIN32 THREAD MANAGER
 *
 * $Id$
 * Copyright (c) 2001 Ravenbrook Limited.  See end of file for license.
 *
 * Implements thread registration, suspension, and stack
 * scanning.  See <design/thread-manager/>.
 *
 * This supports the <code/th.h> along with <code/thw3i3.c> or <code/thw3i6.c>
 *
 * .thread.id: The thread id is used to identify the current thread.
 * .thread.handle: The thread handle needs the enough access to
 * be able to suspend threads and to get their context.  i.e.
 * .thread.handle.susp-res: THREAD_SUSPEND_RESUME access
 * .thread.handle.get-context: THREAD_GET_CONTEXT access
 * An appropriate handle is created on registration.
 *
 *
 * ASSUMPTIONS
 *
 * .error: some major errors are assumed not to happen.
 * .error.close-handle: CloseHandle is assumed to succeed.
 *
 * Other errors are assumed to only happen in certain circumstances.
 * .error.resume: ResumeThread is assumed to succeed unless the thread
 * has been destroyed (in fact, perversely, it appears to succeeed even
 * when the thread has been destroyed).
 * .error.suspend: SuspendThread is assumed to succeed unless the thread
 * has been destroyed.
 *
 *
 * .nt: uses Win32 specific stuff
 * HANDLE
 * DWORD
 * GetCurrentProcess
 * DuplicateHandle
 * THREAD_SUSPEND_RESUME
 * GetCurrentThreadId
 * CloseHandle
 * SuspendThread
 * ResumeThread
 *
