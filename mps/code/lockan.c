 * .purpose: This is a trivial implementation of recursive locks
 * that assumes we are not running in a multi-threaded environment.
 * This provides stubs for the locking code where locking is not
 * applicable.  The stubs provide some amount of checking.
 *
 * .limit: The limit on the number of recursive claims is ULONG_MAX.
