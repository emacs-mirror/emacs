 * and design.mps.protsu for the design specific to this implementation.
 *
 * TRANSGRESSIONS
 *
 * .hack.sigdfl: GCC 2.5.8 produces a warning when we use SIG_DFL with
 * -Wstrict-prototypes, which we want.  SIG_DFL is just zero, so we
 * have our own definition.  We don't expect SIG_DFL to change, because
 * that would break SunOS binaries.  *sigh*

 *
 * This is the signal handler installed by ProtSetup to deal with
 * protection faults.  It is installed on the SIGSEGV signal.
 * It decodes the protection fault details from the signal context
 * and passes them to ArenaAccess, which attempts to handle the
 * fault and remove its cause.  If the fault is handled, then
 * the handler returns and execution resumes.
 *
 * If it isn't handled, then sigHandle does its best to pass the signal
 * on to the previously installed signal handler (sigNext).  sigHandle
 * cannot emulate a signal precisely.  The problems are that the signal
 * mask for that signal (set by sigvec) will not be set properly, also
 * the handler will be executed on the current stack and not on its own
 * stack (if it requested it).
 *
 * .assume.addr: This code assumes that the system will decode the
 * address of the protection violation.  This is documented in the
 * "ADDR" section of the sigvec(2) man page.
 *
 * .sigh.decode: We can't determine the access mode (read, write, etc.)
 * without decoding the faulting instruction.  We don't bother to do
 * this yet.  It can be done later, if necessary.
 *
 * .sigh.size: We also assume that the access only affects the page
 * of the faulting address, i.e. is a single word access or a double-
 * aligned double-word access.
