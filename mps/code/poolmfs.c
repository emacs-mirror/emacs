/* poolmfs.c: MANUAL FIXED SMALL UNIT POOL
 *
 * $Id$
 * Copyright (c) 2001 Ravenbrook Limited.  See end of file for license.
 *
 * This is the implementation of the MFS pool class.
 *
 * DESIGN
 *
 * .design.misplaced: This design is misplaced, it should be in a
 * separate document.
 *
 * MFS operates in a very simple manner: each region allocated from
 * the arena is divided into units.  Free units are kept on a linked
 * list using a header stored in the unit itself.  The linked list is
 * not ordered; allocation anddeallocation simply pop and push from
 * the head of the list.  This is fast, but successive allocations might
 * have poor locality if previous successive frees did.
 *
 * .restriction: This pool cannot allocate from the arena control
 * pool (as the control pool is an instance of PoolClassMV and MV uses
 * MFS in its implementation), nor can it allocate sub-pools, as that
 * causes allocation in the control pool.
 *
 * Notes
 *
 * .freelist.fragments: The simple freelist policy might lead to poor
 * locality of allocation if the list gets fragmented.
 *
 * .buffer.not: This pool doesn't support fast cache allocation, which
 * is a shame.
