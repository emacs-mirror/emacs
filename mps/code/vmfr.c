/* impl.c.vmfr: VIRTUAL MEMORY MAPPING FOR FreeBSD
 *
 * $Id$
 * Copyright (c) 2001 Ravenbrook Limited.
 *
 * .purpose: This is the implementation of the virtual memory mapping
 * interface (vm.h) for FreeBSD.  It was created by copying vmli.c (the
 * DIGITAL UNIX implementation) as that seemed to be closest.
 *
 * .design: See design.mps.vm.  .design.freebsd: mmap(2) is used to
 * reserve address space by creating a mapping with page access none.
 * mmap(2) is used to map pages onto store by creating a copy-on-write
 * (MAP_PRIVATE) mapping with the flag MAP_ANON.
 *
 * .assume.not-last: The implementation of VMCreate assumes that
 * mmap() will not choose a region which contains the last page
 * in the address space, so that the limit of the mapped area
 * is representable.
 *
 * .assume.mmap.err: ENOMEM is the only error we really expect to
 * get from mmap.  The others are either caused by invalid params
 * or features we don't use.  See mmap(2) for details.
 *
 * .remap: Possibly this should use mremap to reduce the number of
 * distinct mappings.  According to our current testing, it doesn't
 * seem to be a problem.
