 *  This scans the stack and fixes the registers which may contain 
 *  roots.  See design.mps.thread-manager
 *
 *  The registers edi, esi, ebx are the registers defined to be preserved
 *  across function calls and therefore may contain roots.
 *  These are pushed on the stack for scanning.
 *
 * ASSUMPTIONS
 *
 * .align: The stack pointer is assumed to be aligned on a word
 * boundary.
