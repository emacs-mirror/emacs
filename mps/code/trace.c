 * roots have to be scanned at flip time, provided we could protect them
 * from the mutator.  (The thread registers are unlikely ever to be
 * protectable on stock hardware, however, as they were -- kind of -- on
 * Lisp machines.)
 *
 * NOTE: Ambiguous references may only exist in roots, because we can't
 * shield the exact roots and defer them for later scanning (after ambiguous
 * heap references).

 * This code also performs various checks about the ranks of the object
 * graph.  Explanations of the checks would litter the code, so the
 * explanations are here, and the code references these.
 *
 * .check.ambig.not: RankAMBIG segments never appear on the grey ring.
 * The current tracer cannot support ambiguous reference except as
 * roots, so it's a bug if we ever find any.  This behaviour is not set
 * in stone, it's possible to imagine changing the tracer so that we can
 * support ambiguous objects one day.  For example, a fully conservative
 * non-moving mode.
 *
 * .check.band.begin: At the point where we start working on a new band
 * of Rank R, there are no grey objects at earlier ranks.  If there
 * were, we would've found them whilst the current band was the previous
 * band.  We don't check this, but I rely on this fact in the next
 * check, .check.weak.no-preserve.
 *
 * .check.weak.band: Weak references cannot cause objects to be
 * newly preserved (marked).  Because of .check.band.begin all the
 * scanning work performed when the current band is a weak rank will be
 * scanning objects at that rank.  There is currently only one weak
 * rank, RankWEAK.
 *
 * .check.final.one-pass: Because all the RankFINAL references are
 * allocated in PoolMRG and effectively treated as roots, all the
 * RankFINAL references will be scanned in one push (possibly split up,
 * incrementally).  Once they have been scanned, no new RankFINAL
 * references will be discovered (the mutator is not permitted to
 * allocate RankFINAL references wherever they like).  In fact because
 * of various coincidences (no Ambig segments so band Exact never
 * discovers an Ambig segment and then more Exact segments; the only
 * other rank is weak so never discovers any new segments) it is the
 * case that for any band R there is an initial burst of scanning
 * segments at rank R then after that we see no more rank R segments
 * whilst working in this band.  That's what we check, although we
 * expect to have to change the check if we introduce more ranks, or
 * start changing the semantics of them.  A flag is used to implement
 * this check.  See <http://info.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/issue/job001658/>.
