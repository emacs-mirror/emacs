 *
 * .aver: This header defines a family of AVER and NOTREACHED macros.
 * These macros should be used to instrument and annotate code with
 * invariants, and so provide both interface and internal consistency
 * checks.
 *
 * .comment: Non-obvious AVER statements should always be accompanied by
 * a comment.
 *
 * .disable: When assertions are disabled, AVER expands to something
 * which contains the condition but discards the result. Compilers
 * will throw the code away, but check its syntax.
 *
 * .trans.level-check: CheckLevel itself is not checked anywhere.
 *
 * .careful: BE CAREFUL when changing this file.  It is easy to make mistakes
 * and change the checking level in a variety and thereby its performance
 * without realising it.  This has happened before.  Eyeball the preprocessor
 * output for each variety.  For example:
 *
 *   cc -E -DCONFIG_PROD_MPS -DCONFIG_VAR_WE trace.c
 *   cc -E -DCONFIG_PROD_MPS -DCONFIG_VAR_HE trace.c
 *   cc -E -DCONFIG_PROD_MPS -DCONFIG_VAR_CI trace.c
 *
 * Then look at TraceCheck to make sure checking is right, TraceAddWhite
 * for general assertions, and TraceFix for the critical path assertions.

 * always defined, and uses the assertion handler from the MPS plinth, which
 * can be replaced by the client code.
 *
 * It is not intended for direct use within the MPS.  Use AVER and CHECK
 * macros, which can be controlled by both build and run-time configuration.

 * varieties intended to work in production.  To avoid the cost of a check
 * in critical parts of the code, use AVER_CRITICAL and AVERT_CRITICAL,
 * but only when you've *proved* that this makes a difference to performance
 * that affects requirements.

/* CHECKL, CHECKD, CHECKU -- local, "down", and "up" checks
 *
 * Each type should have a function defined called <type>Check that checks
 * the consistency of the type.  This function should return TRUE iff the
 * value passes consistency checks.  In general, it should assert otherwise,
 * but we allow for the possibility of returning FALSE in this case for
 * configuration adaptability.
 *
 * For structure types, the check function should:
 *
 *  - check its own signature with CHECKS
 *
 *  - check fields that it "owns" with CHECKL, like asserts
 *
 *  - check "down" values which are its "children" with CHEKCD
 *
 *  - check "up" values which are its "parents" with CHECKU.
 *
 * These various checks will be compiled out or compiled to be controlled
 * by CheckLevel.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 *     Bool MessageCheck(Message message)
 *     {
 *       CHECKS(Message, message);
 *       CHECKU(Arena, message->arena);
 *       CHECKD(MessageClass, message->class);
 *       CHECKL(RingCheck(&message->queueRing));
 *       CHECKL(MessageIsClocked(message) || (message->postedClock == 0));
 *       return TRUE;
 *     }
 *
 * The parent/child distinction depends on the structure, but in the MPS
 * the Arena has no parents, and has children which are Pools, which have
 * children which are Segments, etc.
 *
 * The important thing is to have a partial order on types so that recursive
 * checking will terminate.  When CheckLevel is set to DEEP, checking will
 * recurse into check methods for children, but will only do a shallow
 * signature check on parents, avoiding infinite regression.
 *
 * FIXME: Switching on every CHECK line doesn't compile very well, because
 * the compiler can't tell that CheckLevel won't change between function
 * calls and can't lift out the test.  Is there a better arrangement,
 * perhaps by reading CheckLevel into a local variable?
