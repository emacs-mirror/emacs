/* CLASSES -- the class table
 *
 * "identifier" is the root of the class name, used to form other
 * names.  For example, structures of class Inst are of type
 * InstStruct and the its classes start with InstClassStruct
 * structures.
 *
 * "kind" determines the class object.  For example, the class of
 * CBSLand is Land, which is stored in a LandClassStruct and can be
 * checked by LandClassCheck.
 *
 * "super" is the superclass of the class.
