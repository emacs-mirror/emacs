/* ssixi6.c: UNIX/x64 STACK SCANNING
 *
 * $Id$
 * Copyright (c) 2001-2014 Ravenbrook Limited.  See end of file for license.
 *
 *  This scans the stack and fixes the registers which may contain
 *  roots.  See <design/thread-manager/>
 *
 *  This code was branched from ssixi3.c (32-bit Intel) initially for the
 *  port to XCI6LL (Mac OS X on x86_64 with Clang).
 *
 *  This code is common to more than one Unix implementation on
 *  Intel hardware (but is not portable Unix code).  According to Wikipedia,
 *  all the non-Windows platforms use the System V AMD64 ABI.  See
 *  .sources.callees.saves.
 *
 * SOURCES
 *
 * .sources.callees.saves:
 *  "Registers %rbp, %rbx and %r12 through %r15 "belong" to the calling
 *   function and the called function is required to preserve their values.
 *   In other words, a called function must preserve these registersâ€™ values
 *   for its caller." -- System V AMD64 ABI
 *  <http://x86-64.org/documentation/abi.pdf>
 *
 * ASSUMPTIONS
 *
 * .assume.align: The stack pointer is assumed to be aligned on a word
 * boundary.
 *
 * .assume.asm.stack: The compiler must not do wacky things with the
 * stack pointer around a call since we need to ensure that the
 * callee-save regs are visible during TraceScanArea.
 *
 * .assume.asm.order: The volatile modifier should prevent movement
 * of code, which might break .assume.asm.stack.
 *
