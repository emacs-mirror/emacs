/* sssus8.c: SPARC STACK SCANNING
 *
 * $Id$
 * Copyright (c) 2001 Ravenbrook Limited.  See end of file for license.
 * Portions copyright (c) 2002 Global Graphics Software.
 *
 * This scans the stack and fixes the registers which may contain
 * roots.  See design.mps.thread-manager.
 *
 * .roots: The non-global registers are preserved into the stackframe
 * by the "ta 3" instruction.  This leaves the global registers.
 * According to the Sparc Architecture Manual:
 * %g1 is assumed to be volatile across procedure calls
 * %g2...%g4 are "reserved for use by application programmer"
 * %g5...%g7 are "nonvolatile and reserved for (as-yet-undefined)
 *    use by the execution environment"
 * To be safe %g2 to %g7 are pushed onto the stack before scanning
 * it just in case.
 *
 * ASSUMPTIONS
 *
 * .assume.align: The stack pointer is assumed to be aligned on a word
 * boundary.
 *
 * .assume.asm.stack: The compiler must not do wacky things with the
 * stack pointer around a call since we need to ensure that the
 * callee-save regs are visible during TraceScanArea.
 *
 * .assume.asm.order: The volatile modifier should prevent movement
 * of code, which might break .assume.asm.stack.
