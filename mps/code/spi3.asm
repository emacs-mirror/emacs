;  This function reads a location that is probeDepth words beyond
;  the current stack pointer.  On intel platforms the stack grows
;  downwards so this means reading from a location with a lesser address.
;
;  The registers edi, esi, ebx are the registers defined to be preserved
;  across function calls, so we do not use those.
