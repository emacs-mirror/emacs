 *
 * .design: See <design/prot/> for the generic design of the interface
 * which is implemented in this module, including the contracts for the
 * functions.
 *
 * .purpose: This module implements the part of the protection module
 * that implements the MutatorFaultContext type. 
 *
 *
 * SOURCES

 * General-Purpose and System Instructions
 * <http://support.amd.com/us/Processor_TechDocs/24594_APM_v3.pdf>
 *
 *
 * ASSUMPTIONS
 *
 * .assume.null: It's always safe for Prot*StepInstruction to return
 * ResUNIMPL.  A null implementation of this module would be overly
 * conservative but otherwise correct.
