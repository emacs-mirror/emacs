/* mpsliban.c: RAVENBROOK MEMORY POOL SYSTEM LIBRARY INTERFACE (ANSI)
 *
 * $Id$
 * Copyright (c) 2001 Ravenbrook Limited.  See end of file for license.
 * Portions copyright (c) 2002 Global Graphics Software.
 *
 * .purpose: The purpose of this code is
 *   1. to connect the MPS Library Interface to the ANSI C libraries,
 *      where they exist, and
 *   2. to provide an example of how to implement the MPS Library
 *      Interface.
 *
 * .readership: For MPS client application developers and MPS developers.
 * .sources: <design/lib/>
 *
 *
 * TRANSGRESSIONS (rule.impl.trans)
 *
 * .trans.file: The ANSI standard says (in section 7.9.1) that FILE is an
 * object type, and hence the casts between FILE and mps_lib_FILE (an
 * incomplete type) are not necessarily valid.  We assume that this trick
 * works, however, in all current environments.
