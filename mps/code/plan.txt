================ NOTES; CONSIDER ADDING THESE TO DESIGN DOCS ==================

____PRIMARY____

The primary chunk is used specially:

1. Arenacl requires a chunk to store the ArenaStruct in.  (Whereas arenavm gets storage by simply mapping a new page).  Therefore destroying the primary chunk would (in general) destroy the arena.

2. PageSize is known by chunks, not the arena.  When arena needs to know page size, it asks the primary chunk.

3. Various *Check functions only bother to check the primary chunk, and ignore other chunks.
