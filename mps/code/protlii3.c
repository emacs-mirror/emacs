/* sigHandle -- protection signal handler
 *
 *  This is the signal handler installed by ProtSetup to deal with
 *  protection faults.  It is installed on the SIGSEGV signal.
 *  It decodes the protection fault details from the signal context
 *  and passes them to ArenaAccess, which attempts to handle the
 *  fault and remove its cause.  If the fault is handled, then
 *  the handler returns and execution resumes.  If it isn't handled,
 *  then sigHandle does its best to pass the signal on to the
 *  previously installed signal handler (sigNext).
 *
 *  .sigh.args: There is no officially documented way of getting the
 *  sigcontext, but on x86 Linux at least it is passed BY VALUE as a
 *  second argument to the signal handler.  The prototype doesn't
 *  include this arg.
 *  See .source.linux.kernel (linux/arch/i386/kernel/signal.c).
 *
 *  .sigh.context: We only know how to handle interrupt 14, where
 *  context.err gives the page fault error code and context.cr2 gives
 *  the fault address.  See .source.i486 (9.9.14) and
 *  .source.linux.kernel (linux/arch/i386/mm/fault.c).
 *
 *  .sigh.addr: We assume that the OS decodes the address to something
 *  sensible

 *
 *  Under Linux, the global setup involves installing a signal handler
 *  on SIGSEGV to catch and handle page faults (see sigHandle).
 *  The previous handler is recorded so that it can be reached from
 *  sigHandle if it fails to handle the fault.
 *
 *  NOTE: There are problems with this approach:
 *    1. we can't honor the sa_flags for the previous handler,
 *    2. what if this thread is suspended just after calling signal(3)?
 *       The sigNext variable will never be initialized!
