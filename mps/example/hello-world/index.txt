This is the "hello-world" example; it shows you how to call the MPS from
your code.

To begin, get a copy of the MPS-kit from:
  <http://www.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/release/>

Unpack the MPS-kit.  (You don't need to compile anything yet, so you can
skip the MPS-kit readme.txt file for now).

The MPS-kit unpacks to a directory named "mps-kit-1.108.2" (or similar),
with subdirectories like this:

    mps-kit-1.108.2/
        code/
        design/
        example/
        manual/
        procedure/
        test/
        tool/

The MPS is a software library, implemented in C.  The types, functions,
macros, constants, etc (collectively called "facilities") are declared
in the MPS header files: your code must '#include' the MPS header files
for the facilities you use.  The facilities are implemented in the MPS
libraries: your code must link with the libraries containing the
facilities you use.  The examples below show how to do this.


The "mps.h" header file
-----------------------

Here is a tiny C program to #include the "mps.h" header file and check
that it compiles:

    /* Demo File: 01checkmpsheader.c */
    /* Simple C client of the MPS */
    
    #include "mps.h"
    
    int main(void)
    {
      mps_arena_t ArenaDemo;
      return 0;  /* success */
    }

The "mps.h" header file declares the major (non-optional) MPS
facilities, and all MPS client code needs to #include it.  Find the
"mps.h" header file in the "code" subdirectory of the MPS-kit:

    mps-kit-1.108.2/code/mps.h

For now, just put a copy of "mps.h" into a working directory where you
can try the following examples.  Now you can compile and run
"01checkmpsheader.c".  On Unix you might use:

    % gcc 01checkmpsheader.c
    % ./a.out && echo "success"


Choosing an arena class
-----------------------

The first step in using the MPS is to create an "arena".  Inside this
arena you will create "pools".  Inside the pools you will create
"objects".  Arenas, pools, and objects are abstract data types: you must
use MPS functions to create, change, and destroy them.

The arena abstracts the source of memory from which MPS will allocate:
there are different classes of arena for different sorts of memory
source.  We will start with the "CL" arena class -- the "CL" stands for
"client".  A CL arena takes a big block of memory provided by the client
(our demo program), and uses that as the source of memory in which to
create pools and objects.

The code to create a CL arena will look roughly like this:
    mps_arena_create(&ArenaDemo, mps_arena_class_cl(), arg1, arg2, ...)

Notice that the "CL" arena class is an abstract constant: the constant
is not compiled into your code; instead, you call the MPS function
mps_arena_class_cl() to obtain it.  (Most MPS constants work this way;
it avoids some versioning issues, and makes it easier to port the MPS to
tricky platforms).


Additional MPS header files
---------------------------

The "mps_arena_class_cl" function is declared in the additional MPS
header file "mpsacl.h" ("mpsa" stands for "MPS Arena class").  So put a
copy of "mpsacl.h" into your working directory.  The source code to use
it looks like this:

    /* Demo File: 02checkarenaclassheader.c */
    /* Simple C client of the MPS */
    
    #include "mps.h"
    #include "mpsacl.h"   /* for mps_arena_class_cl */
    
    int main(void)
    {
      mps_arena_t ArenaDemo;
      mps_arena_class_t ArenaClassDemo = NULL;
    
      ArenaClassDemo = mps_arena_class_cl();
      return 0;  /* success */
    }

To compile (but not link) this on Unix you might use the following
command.  (The "-c" tells gcc to stop after compilation).

    % gcc -c 02checkarenaclassheader.c

However, when you try to link, it will fail because we don't have the
MPS library to hand:

    % gcc 02checkarenaclassheader.c
    % # (this will fail)


The MPS library: "mps.a"
------------------------

The MPS library is available on many platforms: Windows, many Unixes,
Mac OS X, etc.  See the MPS-kit readme.txt file for details.  For
example, to compile the MPS library for Mac OS X, you might use this:

    % cd mps-kit-1.108.2/code; make -f xcppgc.gmk VARIETY=ci mps.a

Briefly: "-f xcppgc.gmk" tells the buildsystem to use the makefile for
Mac OS X ("xc"), for the PowerPC architecture ("pp"), using the GCC
compiler ("gc").  "VARIETY=ci" tells it to build the 'cool internal'
variety, which includes asserts and other run-time checks.

Object files and libraries are placed in a separate subdirectory,
according to platform and variety: using the command above makes the
library in "xcppgc/ci/mps.a".  (The "mps.a" on the "make" command-line
is a predefined target that the buildsystem recognises).

There is nothing magical about "mps.a": it is just a collection of
object files built from MPS C source files.  You can tailor your own
collection with extras or omissions.  The MPS-kit build system is
configured to build an "mps.a" with the 'most commonly used' files,
selecting the appropriate variant where there is a platform dependent
choice.

However, when we try to link with it, we find that the MPS library
itself has dependencies:

    % gcc  02checkarenaclassheader.c  mps-kit-1.108.2/code/xcppgc/ci/mps.a
    % # (this will fail)


The MPS plinth: "mpsplan.a"
---------------------------

The dependency is because the MPS needs to call some functions in the
client code (our demo program).  The MPS can do this in two different
ways: through the plinth interface, or through callbacks.  The plinth
interface is for general purpose utility functions, such as
"mps_lib_memcpy" and "mps_lib_assert_fail".  The client must provide
these utility functions, and the MPS uses them.  The idea here is that
the MPS should not assume how the client wants these jobs to be done.

(Note: The MPS also makes some direct operating-system calls. 
Platform-specific source code files in the MPS use direct calls to
cooperate with the operating-system in a platform-dependent manner, such
as to write-protect pages of memory.  These calls do not involve client
code.  In contrast, the plinth interface deals with platform-independent
concepts that the client may have an interest in.)

We don't have to write our own plinth: the MPS-kit includes an example
plinth that uses the standard C library.  This example plinth is called
"mpsplan.a".  ("pl" means plinth; "an" means "ANSI", ie. the standard C
library).

To build the example plinth for Mac OS X, use:

    % cd mps-kit-1.108.2/code; make -f xcppgc.gmk VARIETY=ci mpsplan.a

Now we can link and run our simple demo file:

    % gcc  02checkarenaclassheader.c  mps-kit-1.108.2/code/xcppgc/ci/mps.a  mps-kit-1.108.2/code/xcppgc/ci/mpsplan.a
    % ./a.out && echo "success"


Recap
-----

We have now found and are using:
  - the main "mps.h" header file;
  - the additional MPS header file "mpsacl.h";
  - (in "mpsacl.h") the identifier function "mps_arena_class_cl" 
    for the "CL" arena class we want to use;

We have built and are using:
  - the MPS library "mps.a";
  - the example plinth "mpsplan.a".

Now we can start to use more MPS functions.  In the next three sections
we will create an arena (of class "CL"), create a pool (of class "MV"),
and then allocate some memory.


Creating an arena
-----------------

Look up the reference manual entry for mps_arena_class_cl() at
<http://www.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/master/manual/reference/#
mps_arena_class_cl>.  The notes and example code in the manual entry
describe the additional parameters that we need to pass to
"mps_arena_create()".  For a "CL" class arena, we first allocate a big
block of memory, and then call mps_arena_create passing the count of
bytes and a pointer to the first byte:

    /* Demo File: 03arena_create.c */
    /* Simple C client of the MPS */
    
    #include <stdlib.h>  /* for malloc */
    #include <stdio.h>  /* for printf */
    
    #include "mps.h"
    #include "mpsacl.h"   /* for mps_arena_class_cl */
    
    int main(void)
    {
      void *pBlock = NULL;
      size_t cbBlock = 1024 * 1024;
      mps_arena_t ArenaDemo = NULL;

      mps_res_t res;

      pBlock = malloc(cbBlock);
      if(pBlock == NULL) {
        printf("malloc failed!\n");
        exit(1);
      }

      res = mps_arena_create(
        &ArenaDemo,
        mps_arena_class_cl(),
        cbBlock,
        pBlock
      );
      switch (res) {
        case MPS_RES_OK:
          break;
        case MPS_RES_MEMORY:
          printf("mps_arena_create: cbBlock too small\n");
          exit(2);
        case MPS_RES_FAIL:
          printf(
            "mps_arena_create: refused; "
            "see MPS reference manual\n"
          );
          exit(2);
      }

      /* rest of program */
      printf("Success.\n");
      return 0;
    }

To run this file:

    % gcc  03arena_create.c  mps-kit-1.108.2/code/xcppgc/ci/mps.a  mps-kit-1.108.2/code/xcppgc/ci/mpsplan.a
    % ./a.out


Creating a pool
---------------

Before allocating memory, we must create a "pool".  A pool abstracts a
collection of objects that are managed in the same way.  The "way an
object is managed" means the protocol used by the client and MPS to
create, maintain, and destroy the object.

We will create a pool of the "MV" pool class.  "MV" roughly stands for
"manual, variable".  "Manual" means the client explicitly tells the MPS
when to free the object (in contrast to an "automatic" protocol, ie.
with automatic garbage collection, where the client never calls free). 
"Variable" means the pool can hold objects of varying sizes.

The functions we need are "mps_class_mv()" and "mps_pool_create()" --
these are analogous to the "mps_arena_class_cl" and "mps_arena_create"
we needed for creating an arena.  [Note the inconsistent naming:
"mps_class_mv" should really be called "mps_pool_class_mv".]

Put a copy of "mpscmv.h" into your working directory ("mpsc" stands for
"MPS (pool) Class"; "MV" is the name of the pool class).  It declares
the "mps_class_mv" function, and some useful pool-class-specific
functions.  We will use "mps_class_mv()" and "mps_mv_free_size()".

If you attempt to look up the reference manual entries for
"mps_class_mv()" and "mps_pool_create()", you will find they are
missing.  Section 4 of the reference manual lists them as valid
client-callable functions, but currently undocumented:

  <http://www.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/master/manual/reference/#section-4>

Don't despair.  Look in the "code" subdirectory of the MPS-kit, and find
the file "poolmv.h".

The "poolmv.h" file is internal to the MPS, and contains part of the
implementation of the "MV" pool class.  The MPS tries hard to keep its
external interface (header files beginning "mps...") separate from its
internal details.  Where the external documentation is lacking, you can
look at internal materials such as design documentation, implementation
files, and module test files, but be aware that you have crossed over to
the 'internal world' of the MPS.  Two differences you may notice in
internal code are that the types used are different, and function names
are different.  It should go without saying that your client code should
never rely on the particular details of the MPS implementation.  If you
(as an MPS user writing client code) find yourself needing to look
inside the MPS implementation, that suggests there is a fault in the
external documentation: please contact us and let us know.

The parameters used to create a pool of class "MV" are discussed in the
comments at the top of the "poolmv.h" file.  When creating a pool of
class "MV", mps_pool_create requires three extra arguments, which hold
tuning parameters that help the pool to perform its tasks efficiently. 
The first and third arguments relate to the size of the pool; the second
argument relates to the size of objects in the pool.  (See the comments
in "poolmv.h" for more detail).

All three arguments are counts of bytes.  The correct type for client
code to specify counts of bytes is "size_t".  (This is not documented;
it ought to be documented under "mps_class_mv" in the reference manual. 
Note that it is incorrect to use the "Size" type -- this is an
MPS-internal type.)

Finally, note that:
  "mpscmv.h" is an 'external' header file -- part of the interface 
             to the MPS, which you #include.
  "poolmv.h" is an 'internal' header file, *not* a client-visible 
             MPS header: your code should not (and does not need 
             to) #include it.  

Here is code to create an arena, and create an MV class pool within it:

    /* Demo File: 04pool_create.c */
    /* Simple C client of the MPS */
    
    #include <stdlib.h>  /* for malloc */
    #include <stdio.h>  /* for printf */
    
    #include "mps.h"
    #include "mpsacl.h"   /* for mps_arena_class_cl */
    #include "mpscmv.h"   /* for mps_class_mv */
    
    int main(void)
    {
      void *pBlock = NULL;
      size_t cbBlock = 1024 * 1024;
      mps_arena_t ArenaDemo = NULL;
      mps_pool_t PoolDemo = NULL;

      mps_res_t res;
    
      {
        /* Create arena */
        
        pBlock = malloc(cbBlock);
        if(pBlock == NULL) {
          printf("malloc failed!\n");
          exit(1);
        }

        res = mps_arena_create(
          &ArenaDemo,
          mps_arena_class_cl(),
          cbBlock,
          pBlock
        );
        if (res != MPS_RES_OK) {
          printf("mps_arena_create: failed with res %d.\n", res);
          exit(2);
        }
      }
      
      {
        /* Create pool */
        
        size_t cbPoolExtend = 1024;
        size_t cbObjectAvg = 32;
        size_t cbPoolMax = 64 * 1024;
        
        size_t cbPoolFree = 0;

        res = mps_pool_create(
          &PoolDemo,
          ArenaDemo,
          mps_class_mv(),
          cbPoolExtend,
          cbObjectAvg,
          cbPoolMax
        );
        if (res != MPS_RES_OK) {
          printf("mps_pool_create: failed with res %d.\n", res);
          exit(2);
        }
        
        cbPoolFree = mps_mv_free_size(PoolDemo);
        printf(
          "PoolDemo has %lu bytes free.\n",
          (unsigned long)cbPoolFree
        );
      }

      /* rest of program */
      {
        printf("Success.\n");
        return 0;
      }
    }

Compiling and running this produces the possibly surprising result that
the freshly-created pool has zero (0) bytes free:

    % gcc  04pool_create.c  mps-kit-1.108.2/code/xcppgc/ci/mps.a  mps-kit-1.108.2/code/xcppgc/ci/mpsplan.a
    % ./a.out
    % # (should say: "PoolDemo has 0 bytes free.")

Pools request chunks of storage from their arena when they need it, and
return it afterwards.  The MV pool class code does not request storage
until the first object is allocated; this is why PoolDemo has 0 bytes
free initially: it has not yet claimed memory from the arena.


Allocating some memory
----------------------

Finally, we can now allocate some memory!  We use the simple "mps_alloc"
function, and store the text "hello, world" in the memory, and print it
out.

    /* Demo File: 05alloc.c */
    /* Simple C client of the MPS */
    
    #include <stdlib.h>  /* for malloc */
    #include <stdio.h>  /* for printf */
    #include <string.h>  /* for strcpy */
    
    #include "mps.h"
    #include "mpsacl.h"   /* for mps_arena_class_cl */
    #include "mpscmv.h"   /* for mps_class_mv */
    
    static void reportPoolmv(mps_pool_t Pool)
    {
        size_t cbPoolFree = mps_mv_free_size(Pool);
        printf(
          "Pool has %lu bytes free.\n",
          (unsigned long)cbPoolFree
        );
    }
    
    int main(void)
    {
      void *pBlock = NULL;
      size_t cbBlock = 1024 * 1024;
      mps_arena_t ArenaDemo = NULL;
      mps_pool_t PoolDemo = NULL;

      mps_res_t res;
    
      {
        /* Create arena */
        
        pBlock = malloc(cbBlock);
        if(pBlock == NULL) {
          printf("malloc failed!\n");
          exit(1);
        }

        res = mps_arena_create(
          &ArenaDemo,
          mps_arena_class_cl(),
          cbBlock,
          pBlock
        );
        if (res != MPS_RES_OK) {
          printf("mps_arena_create: failed with res %d.\n", res);
          exit(2);
        }
      }
      
      {
        /* Create pool */
        
        size_t cbPoolExtend = 1024;
        size_t cbObjectAvg = 32;
        size_t cbPoolMax = 64 * 1024;
        
        size_t cbPoolFree = 0;

        res = mps_pool_create(
          &PoolDemo,
          ArenaDemo,
          mps_class_mv(),
          cbPoolExtend,
          cbObjectAvg,
          cbPoolMax
        );
        if (res != MPS_RES_OK) {
          printf("mps_pool_create: failed with res %d.\n", res);
          exit(2);
        }
        
        reportPoolmv(PoolDemo);
      }

      {
        /* Allocate memory */
        
        size_t cbBuffer = 100;
        void *p = NULL;

        res = mps_alloc(&p, PoolDemo, cbBuffer);
        if (res != MPS_RES_OK) {
          printf("mps_alloc: failed with res %d.\n", res);
          exit(2);
        }
        
        reportPoolmv(PoolDemo);

        {
          /* Show that it really is memory */

          char *pbBuffer = (char *)p;
          
          strcpy(pbBuffer, "hello--world\n");
          pbBuffer[5] = ',';
          pbBuffer[6] = ' ';
          printf(pbBuffer);
        }
      }

      printf(
        "Success: The hello-world example code successfully allocated\n"
        "some memory using mps_alloc(), in an MV pool, in a CL arena.\n"
      );
      return 0;
    }

To compile and run this:

    % gcc  05alloc.c  mps-kit-1.108.2/code/xcppgc/ci/mps.a  mps-kit-1.108.2/code/xcppgc/ci/mpsplan.a
    % ./a.out
    % # (should say: "PoolDemo has 0 bytes free.")
    % # (and then:   "PoolDemo has NNNN bytes free.", where NNNN depends on platform.)
    % # (and then:   "hello, world")

That's the end of this example code.
