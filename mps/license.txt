Memory Pool System Kit Open Source License
==========================================

This is the license under which the Memory Pool System Kit is available as
open source.

**It is not the only way the MPS is licensed.**

If the licensing terms aren't suitable for you (for example, you're
developing a closed-source commercial product or a compiler run-time
system) you can easily license the MPS under different terms from
Ravenbrook.  Please write to us at `<mps-questions@ravenbrook.com>`_
for more information.

The open source license for the MPS is the `Sleepycat License`_ also
known as the "Berkeley Database License".  This license is
`GPL compatible`_ and `OSI approved`_.  The MPS is "multi licensed" in
a manner similar to MySQL.

Exceptions
----------

**Open Dylan**

    Software that makes use of the Memory Pool System only via the Dylan
    programming language using the Open Dylan implementation and any
    accompanying software is exempt from clause 3 of the license, provided
    that the Dylan program is not providing memory management services.  For
    the avoidance of doubt, this exemption does not apply to software
    directly using a copy of the Memory Pool System received as part of the
    Open Dylan source code.
