INTRODUCTIONThis is the Memory Pool System Kit -- a compelete set of sources forusing, modifying, and adapting the MPS.The Memory Pool System (MPS) is a very general, adaptable, flexible,reliable, and efficient memory management system.  It permits theflexible combination of memory management techniques, supporting manualand automatic memory management, in-line allocation, finalization,weakness, and multiple concurrent co-operating incremental generationalgarbage collections.  It also includes a library of memory pool classesimplementing specialized memory management policies.  [Where to go formore details -- reference to overview document.]This document is a brief introduction to the kit.  [Where to go for moredetails.]The readership of this document is anyone who wants to modify, adapt, orextend the MPS.This document is not confidential.2. GETTING STARTEDThe MPS Kit is a complete set of sources and documentation to enablethird parties to use, modify, and adapt the MPS.For Windows, the kit is distributed as the ZIP archive"mps-kit-1.100.0.zip".  Unpack it using WinZip.For Unix and Mac OS X, the integration kit is distributed as the tarball"mps-kit-1.100.0.tar.gz".  Unpack it using the command "gunzip -cmps-kit-1.100.0.tar.gz | tar xvf -", or by dropping the file ontoStuffIt Expander under Mac OS X.The top-level file "index.html" in the sources indexes many other files,and is a good place to start.  You should read the user manuals and thehigh level design documents.3. THE STRUCTURE OF THE KITThe Integration Kit is a copy of the sources used to develop andmaintain the MPS at Ravenbrook Limited <http://www.ravenbrook.com/>. The"sources" are all the things that go to make up the product, not justsource code files.  For example, the sources for the manuals are heretoo, because we maintain them in parallel with the code.The sources at Ravenbrook are mirrored from our Perforce configurationmanagement server onto our internal web server at info.ravenbrook.com,and are designed to be browsed on that server.  You will find HTMLdocuments which index many of the directories.  Read these, startingwith the top level "index.html".  You might find some links to"info.ravenbrook.com" or "/project/mps/...".  Sorry about that -- it'spartly due to the nature of HTML links.  You will find most projectdocuments from the MPS Project page<http://www.ravenbrook.com/project/mps/>, including many documentswhich aren't "sources" but may still be useful to understand the historyof the project.[A note about confidential sources being excluded.]4. DEVELOPING USING THE KITThe MPS can be built on a wide variety of platforms.  For Unix-likeplatforms you will need the GNU Make tool.  Some platforms (such asLinux and Mac OS X) have GNU Make as their default make tool.  Forothers you will need to get and install it.  (It's available free from<ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/make/>.)  On Windows platforms the NMAKE tool isused.  This comes with Microsoft Visual C++.The MPS can also be built on Mac OS 7 through Mac OS 9 using MPW orMetrowerks Codewarrior, but neither of these builds have been maintainedfor some time, and probably no longer work.  We've included themakefiles/project files as a starting point.[What about other platforms which probably don't work?]              Table 1.

(Sometimes this will be"gmake" or "gnumake".)To build just one target, type:  make -f <makefile> <target>To build a restricted set of targets for just one variety, type:  make -f <makefile> 'VARIETY=<variety>' <target>For example, to build just the "cool internal" variety of the "amcss"test on FreeBSD:  gmake -f fri4gc.gmk 'VARIETY=ci' amcssOn Windows platforms you need to run "VCVARS32.BAT" to initialize yourenvironment variables, and make sure that MASM (command name ML) is onyour path.  MASM is available free from Microsoft.  Then type:  nmake /f w3i3mv.nmk[And so on, like Unix.  DDK, ML.ERR, ML.EXE, blah blah][Building usually generates "mps.a" or equivalent, which you link withyour application, but see "Licensing".]5. TESTING[Some stuff about how to run the test suite.]6. BUILDING AND TESTING A RELEASE7. CONTRIBUTING YOUR WORKWe'd like to include improvements to the MPS in the distributions fromRavenbrook Limited.  Please consider putting your work under an opensource license and sending it to us.It will help a great deal if your work is self-consistent.  This meansthat the documentation is up to date (even if only with sketchy butaccurate notes) and the procedures have been maintained.8. GETTING HELPYou can obtain expert professional support for the MPS from RavenbrookLimited <http://www.ravenbrook.com/>, the developers of the MPS, whohave many years of experience in commercial memory management systems. Write to us <info@ravenbrook.com> for more information.You might also want to join the MPS discussion mailing list.  To join,send a message with the word "subscribe" in the body tomps-discussion-request@ravenbrook.com or send the word "help" forgeneral information.9. LICENSINGThe MPS is distributed under an open source license (see the file"license.txt").  The license is designed to make it possible for you touse the MPS in your own projects, provided that you either don'tdistribute your product, or your product is open source too.If you are developing a closed source product and want to use the MPSyou must license under commercial terms from Ravenbrook Limited<http://www.ravenbrook.com/>.
