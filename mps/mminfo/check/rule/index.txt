Scope: This checklist is to be used for checking documents of type "rule".  It is 
derived from rule.rule.


.accept: Have the rules been reviewed against rule.rule and rule.universal and 
been accepted?

.page: Is the rule document not more than 60 lines long?

.tag: Is every rule tagged with a unique name?

.new: Are the tags chosen for the rules fresh (i.e., they have never been used 
for different rules in the past)?

.sc: Is the scope of the rule set clearly stated and tagged ".scope"?
