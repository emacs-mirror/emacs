Scope: This checklist is for use in reviews of implementations, using the dependency 
role (see rule.impl.dep).

Summary: Are all change-dependencies marked and cross-referenced?


DEFINITIONS

.def: A change-dependency is where a significant change to one document will require a corresponding change elsewhere to continue to meet requirements.


.doc: Does all code that is dependent on non-local change have documentation of 
the dependency?

.tag: Is all documentation of dependency tagged?

.ref: Does all dependent code have a reference to the tag of the other document?

.back-ref: Do the other documents corresponding to change dependencies have 
backwards references?  [N.B.: Not strictly a check on the product document.]
