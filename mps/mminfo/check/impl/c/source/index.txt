Scope: This checklist support the checking of C code within the Source checking role 
(see role.check.source).

Summary: Is the product document externally consistent with source documents and appropriately linked?


Requirements

.req.correct: Have implemented requirements been implemented correctly?

.req.complete: Have all requirements in the source documents been implemented 
in the product document unless documented otherwise?


References

.ref.doc: Does the product document refer to the source documents in the header?

.ref.internal: Are requirement/feature-specific or otherwise unclear parts of 
the product document linked back to appropriate parts of the source documents?

.ref.exist: Do all internal and external references in the product document 
actually exist?


Design

.des.correct: Are the designs in source documents faithfully implemented?

.des.complete: Are the designs in source documents fully implemented unless 
documented otherwise?


Header Files

.header.fun: Are any functions used from header file source documents, used 
with parameters of an appropriate type?

.header.impl: Do header files correspond with their implementations in types, 
prototypes, and documentation?

.header.type: Are types imported from header file source documents used 
correctly?
