Scope: This checklist supports the checking of C code within the Correctness checking 
role (see role.check.correctness).

Summary: Does the code have the intended effect?


.domain: Do functions have the correct behaviour for all domain values 
including NULL and 0?

.error.check: Are function status/error/exception returns checked and acted 
upon?

.error.return: Are error/exception conditions returned correctly from functions?

.interrupt: Will the code interract correctly with interrupts, tickles, and 
re-entrancy?

.doc: Are all statements in documentation correct?

.type.portable: Will the types used work correctly on all platforms?

.align: Will alignment be correct on all platforms?

.macro.arg-eval: Are multiply-evaluated macro arguments side-effect free?

.specific: Is the code free from dependency on undefined, unspecified, 
implementation-defined, etc. behaviour?
