Scope: This checklist is for use in reviews of implementations, using the platform 
role (see rule.impl.platform).

Summary: Are all architecture/OS/builder specific features used only when there is no appropriate portable alternative.


.import: Does the implementation import any platform-specific features only 
where there is no appropriate portable alternative?

.interface: Does the implementation use no platform-specific features where 
there is a generic interface that could have been used?
