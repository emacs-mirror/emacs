Scope: This checklist is for use in reviews of implementations, using the simple role 
(see rule.impl.simple).

Summary: Is the code as simple as possible to meet requirements?


.exp: Are all expressions as simple as possible while meeting requirements?

.alg: Are all algorithms as simple as possible while meeting requirements?

.fun: Are function interfaces as simple as they can be whilst meeting 
requirements?

.data: Are structures, etc. as simple as they can be whilst meeting 
requirements?

.dup: Where functionality is provided through two interfaces (e.g. in-line and 
conventional functions, variable argument lists, error clean-up code), does one 
implementation invoke the other where appropriate?

.doc: Does the documentation eschew obscure volcabulary, and phrasing?
