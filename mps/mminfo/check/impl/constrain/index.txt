Scope: This checklist is for use in reviews of implementations, using the constrain 
role (see rule.impl.constrain)

Summary: Are all constraints of functionality and attributes easy to change?


.magic: Have all "magic" numbers (e.g. array lengths, sentinel values, masks) 
been defined as symbolic constants?

.deriv: Where a constant derives from other constants, is its derivation 
calculated in the implementation, where appropriate (e.g. bit mask constructed 
from disjunction)?
