Scope: This checklist is for use in reviews of implementations, using the adapt role 
(see rule.impl.adapt).

Summary: Is the implementation as open-ended as possible?


.limit: Are arbitrary limits avoided?

.general: Are any concepts generalised where appropriate?

.type: Are types cheaply extensible where appropriate (e.g. variable length 
arrays, enumerations)?

.interface: Do interfaces permit extension cheaply?

.res: Do all functions which could reasonably fail in future implementations 
have status returns where appropriate?
