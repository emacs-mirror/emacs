Scope: This checklist is to be used for review of implementations, using the 
requirements role (rule.impl.req).

Summary: Does the implementation meet all relevant requirements?


.ref.global: Does the implementation reference the requirements it satisfies in 
a leader comment?

.ref.local: Does code specific to certain requirements reference those 
requirements?

.meet.global: Does the implementation meet all the requirements it ought to?

.meet.local: Does any code specific to certain requirements actually meet those 
requirements, where appropriate?

.risk: Are any risks (of not meeting requirements) clearly identified?
