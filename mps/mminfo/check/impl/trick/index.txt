Scope: This checklist is for use in reviews of implementations, using the trick role 
(see rule.impl.trick).

Summary: Does the implementation use no unnecessary tricks?


.macro: Are all uses of a pre-processor no more subtle than is appropriate?

.type: Do all types rely only on appropriately language-independent techniques?

.op: Does the implementation avoid inappropriate composition or uncommon use of 
operators?

.order: Does the implementation place no reliance on order of evaluation of 
side-effects?

.env: Does the implementation use a uniform environment, i.e. are any imports 
gathered at the start?

.precedence: Does the implementation avoid unintuitive operator precedence?

.coerce: Does the implementation avoid reliance on implicit type coercion?
