Scope: This checklist is for use in reviews of implementations, using the justify role 
(see rule.impl.justify).

Summary: Is the purpose of every code statement clear?


.trick: Are all "tricks" properly documented?

.change: Is it clear which requirements would be affected by changing any 
statement?

.right: Is it clear for all code that its behaviour will meet requirements?

.cons: Are all comments consistent with the code?

.robust: Does the implementation meet all robustness requirements (e.g. all 
function parameters checked, all fields checked in check functions)?
