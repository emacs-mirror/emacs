Scope: This checklist is for use in reviews of implementations, using the minimum role 
(see rule.impl.min).

Summary: Does the implementation provide no more functionality than is required?


.path: Are all control flow paths used?

.type: Are all types, enumeration members, and structure members used?

.assert: Is extra functionality (e.g. extra domain values) blocked by 
appropriate (e.g. assertion) techniques?

.unused: Is there no unused code (e.g. functions, parameters)?
