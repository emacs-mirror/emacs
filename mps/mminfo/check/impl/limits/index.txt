Scope: This checklist is for use in reviews of implementations, using the limits role 
(see rule.impl.limits).

Summary: Are all limitations exposed to the clients of the implementation?


.const: Are special values in function domains exported (e.g. maximum values as 
symbolic constants)?

.domain: Is any deviation between the domain of a function and its types 
documented (e.g. pointers may not be NULL)?

.resource: Are resource limitations exported where appropriate (e.g. is the 
maximum number of open files accessible via an access function)?
