Scope: This checklist is for use in reviews of implementations, using the design role 
(see rule.impl.design).

Summary: Are all decisions which reflect requirements documented in tagged design documents, which are referenced?


DEFINITION

.def: A decision is "requirements-reflecting" if it is crucial to meeting requirements.


.doc: Are all decisions which reflect requirements documented?

.design: Are all implementation decisions that reflect requirements documented 
in design documents?  [They may also be documented in the implementation.]

.ref: Does the implementation reference the design regarding 
requirements-reflecting decisions?

.init: Do all object initializations/finalizations bring the object to an 
initial/final state defined in the design?
