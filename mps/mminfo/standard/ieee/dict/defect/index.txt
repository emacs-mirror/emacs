IEEE Std 100-1992 (IEEE Standard Dicitionary of Electrical and Electronics
Terms) has the definition of defect in the context of software taken from
IEEE Std 982.1-1988 and 982.2-1988:

        A product anomaly. Examples include such things as (A) omissions
        and imperfections found during early life cycle phases and
        (B) faults contained in software sufficiently mature for test or
        operation. See also "fault".

The definition for "fault" in the context of software is taken from IEEE
Std 610.12-1990:

        (A) A defect in a hardware device or component; for example, a
        short circuit or broken wire. (B) An incorrect step, process, or
        data definition in a computer program. _Note:_ This definition
        is used primarily by the fault tolerance discipline. In common
        usage, the terms "error" and "bug" are used to express this
        meaning. See also: data-sensitive fault; program-sensitive fault;
        equivalent faults; fault masking; intermittent fault.
