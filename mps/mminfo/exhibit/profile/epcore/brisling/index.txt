.compare.anchovy: COMPARISON WITH ANCHOVY

On resource.terpsichore (Intel NT).
Using SWproc_pc(SW_D) 1998-12-04, with variety.we of either 
release.epcore.anchovy.3 or release.epcore.brisling.pre.1.

SW settings: single (if) output, testhqn capstan, monochrome 1270dpi, HDS fine, 
extra grays (4096). 30MB for RIP. (See the .log attachments for the gory 
details if you want them.)

Jobs: QATROUBLE, i.e. 0000CONF.PS, 8000BK.PS, AUSENPLAN.PS, BASS.PS, 
MNCHENWK.PS, MUSICIAN.PS, RADIOCAS.PS, TESTEK.PST.

Profiling with CAP (use CAPVIEW to view the .end files):

Profiles and logs for release.anchovy.3, variety.we: ,
Profiles and logs for releae.epcore.brisling.pre.1, variety.we: .

Of course the times in these logs aren't realistic, because profiling slows 
everything down. So here are some logs for the same task without profiling: , .

.compare.arenas: COMPARISON OF CL AND VMNZ ARENAS

SW date and settings as for .compare.anchovy above. Some jobs get faster, 
others slower when you switch between CL and VM arenas. I don't think it's 
particularly meaningful to look at the overall speed of the QATROUBLE suite, as 
I've no reason to believe it's representative. Here are logs for all of 
QATROUBLE, with four versions of ScriptWorks:
   bp1vm = release.epcore.brisling.pre.1, VMNZ arena class,
   bp1cl = release.epcore.brisling.pre.1, CL arena class,
   a3vm  = release.epcore.anchovy.3, VMNZ arena class,
   a3cl  = release.epcore.anchovy.3, CL arena class.
   (All with variety.we.)
AUSENPLN.PS

This job is slower with the VM arena.

Here are logs from non-profiling runs.: .
Here are CAP profiles of MM time: .

I've only had a quick look at the profiles, but it looks like segment 
allocation and freeing takes longer in the VMNZ arena.



BASS.PS

This job is faster with the VM arena.
Logs: .
Profiles: .

I've only had a quick look at the profiles, and I don't know what's going on 
here. The numbers of allocation aren't the same, so perhaps the extra address 
space in the VMNZ arena is allowing SW to avoid having to perform some memory 
action that gets invoked in the CL case.
