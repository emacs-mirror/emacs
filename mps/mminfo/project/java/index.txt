PROJECT

.history: The initial idea for some sort of Java MM project was formed around 
March 1996 (witness: mail.richard.1997-09-22.14-47(0)).  The idea at that was 
to negotiate an OEM deal with Sun.  Scant progress was made; effort and 
enthusiasm for the project seemed to peter out after around mid 1997.  More 
recently the quartet has essentially blessed the project, witness 
mail.daveb.1998-12-15.17-31.  Currently, 1999-02-18, the project is active.
