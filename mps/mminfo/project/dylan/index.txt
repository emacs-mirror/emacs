PROJECT

.overview: Early on in the MM group's history it was desired to provide a 
garbage collector and other memory management services for the DylanWorks 
compiler.  The relationship is ongoing.

.prop: The MM group met Mike Smith and Tony Mann in May 1994 
(meeting.dylan.1994-05-13) to discuss what the MM group could provide for 
DylanWorks.  A proposal was formed and submitted to SP Divisional Management 
(at the time, Pries).  It was accepted.

.goal: The project goals, produced in MM/DylanWorks meetings, are in 
goal.dylan.

.req: The project requirements, produced from joint MM/DylanWorks technical 
meetings, are in req.dylan.

.design: The project design, produced by analysis of the requirements, is in 
design.dylan.

.plan: The project plan, showing how and when the goals are to be met, is in 
plan.dylan.

.client: The client is now Functional Objects 
<URL:http://www.functionalobjects.com/> (a.k.a. fun-o), to whom the rights to 
Harlequin Dylan were passed.  The exact status of MPS in this arrangment is 
unclear; Neil Wylie is negotiating with them.  .contact: The contact person is 
Jonathan Bachrach <jrb@functionalobjects.com>.  There is also a fun-o mailing 
list, mm@functionalobjects.com, that might usually be a suitable contact.
