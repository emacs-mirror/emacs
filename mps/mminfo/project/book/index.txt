OVERVIEW

management for external publication, that meets the goals of goal.book.

Gordon at Addison Wesley: mail.andrews.1997-07-14:15-38. 

.sample.external-reviews: Addison Wesley gave the sample to a team of anonymous 
reviewers. PTW and AndrewS have
copies of the reviews that were returned. They are not stored electronically, 
but we can give out photocopies. For the record,
these reviews were returned on 1997-10-30.

.sample.revision: Addison Wesley asked us to consider the sample reviews and 
send them a revised contents outline and preface. We decided to focus the book 
on Java (a decision which is not documented anywhere other than here at the 
moment) and sent back this preface and this contents outline. The revised 
sample materials are here: 

.internal-customers: See interest.book.
