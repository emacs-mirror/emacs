INTRODUCTION


DISCUSSION

The purpose of architectural design (architecture) is to provide a link between 
detailed design/implementation and project requirements, and thus to ensure 
quality by justifying the implementation.

The nature of these links is requirements (going downwards) and justification 
(going upwards).  In other words, the architecture provides requirements for 
the designs, and the designs are justified in terms of the architecture's 
requirements.

HOW TO DO IT


Functional Requirements

Easy -- just break down the functionality into functions.


Attributes

Time (pause): examine and design code paths, specifying bounds on certain 
events, e.g. no more than 3 page faults.

Time (overhead): specify the overhead as a function of the data, and break down.

Space (overhead): design data structures with specified bounds

Space (basic): simple limitation


Design Constraints

Obtain the specifications for each constraint and work out the consequences for 
detailed design and implementation.  Respecify as requirements in those terms.


Protocols

Similar to design constraints.
