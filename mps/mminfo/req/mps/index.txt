INTRODUCTION

.intro: This document collects general requirements on the MPS, both those 
common to most of its clients and those arising out of its general goals.

.source: These requirements should support goal.mps, and whatever the clients 
need to support: see req.epcore, req.dylan, and even req.product.


History

.hist.0: Pekka started recording these 2000-06-28.


FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

.fun.replace: MPS can be used to replace an existing memory manager without 
extensive restructuring of the client application.  [Is this a product 
requirement?]
