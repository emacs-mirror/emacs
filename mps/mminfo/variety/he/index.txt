.use: This variety is intended for use by external customers for profiling and 
high performance work.

.source: See design.mps.variety for more information, and an explanation of 
some of the terms used.

.desc: This variety is intended to have as much checking and telemetry as 
possible, but with no significant performance overhead as compared to 
variety.wi, and also to give the minimum possible information away to 
competitors. 

.slow: A "significant performance overhead" is a slow-down in the memory 
manager of more than 10% in any typical client operation.

.slow.just: The figure 10% was chosen because it is at a level that an 
interactive user would not observe. 

.check: It has a subset of checking, but is unswitchable.  

.strip: The objects files are without the data required to support a debugger.  
In future, it may be possible to strip extraneous symbols from the library.  
This is its only difference from variety.hi.

.telemetry: Currently this variety has no telemetry, but in the future it will 
have a subset of internal telemetry, but no external telemetry.

.opt: There should be no differences in compiler options from variety.wi; in 
particular, the optimisation level should be the same.
