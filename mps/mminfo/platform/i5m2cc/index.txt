Pre-processor symbol: MPS_PF_I5M2CC


Status: Investigated.  drj believes this is reasonably easy.  Not many pitfalls.

Distinguished from Irix 4, with which it was previously confused.

Here's a recommended way to invoke SGI's Irix cc compiler:
  cc -c -ansiposix -D_BSD_TYPES -fullwarn -g
  (this comes from ScriptWorks, vaguely)
  I'm not sure we need -ansiposix (-ansi ought to do us) and -D_BSD_TYPES

This is also suitable for Irix 6, using the O32 ABI.
