Pre-processor symbol: MPS_PF_IAM4CC


.sw: This is a required platform for MM/EP-core.

.what: This is basically the same as platform.iam4cc, just compiled with a 
different (version of the?) compiler.  impl.h.mpstd will actually detect this 
platform as MPS_PF_IAM4CC, since there is no difference to detect.
