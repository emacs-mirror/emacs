1. The full Inspection process will be exploited (especialy Mays and Jones, 
Improvement Logging, and so on).

2. Return on Investment shall be continuously monitored (time spent versus time 
saved).

3. All quality improvement shall be planned and monitored using agreed measures 
of it.

4. Entry and exit controls shall be established for all work processes under 
continuous improvement.

5. All work processes shall have "owners" of the processes, through ownership 
of their corresponding standards (rules, procedures, exit criteria, entry 
criteria, forms, codes, optimum work rates).

6. The overall continuous improvement rate shall be at least 40% per year 
unless other specific rates are needed for individual measures of improvement.

7. Documents shall not exit unless they have fewer than three major defects per 
page (600 words of non-commentary) estimated remaining after correct editing of 
logged issues.  (Within two years this should be less than 0.3.)

8. Management is responsible for quality and the changes needed to improve it.

9. Staff must have daily-use practical mechanisms for suggesting process 
improvements.

10. We will give priority to effort and mechanisms for learning to avoid 
mistakes (time, training, tools for the staff).
