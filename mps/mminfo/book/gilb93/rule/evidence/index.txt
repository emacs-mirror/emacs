CHECK: Evidence shall permit the reader to further investigate the claim by 
going to written or oral sources for confirmation.

FACT: Evidence shall be based on historical evidence.  This means dates, 
places, projects, people, and measures of effect shall be given.  Otherwise "no 
facts available" shall be stated.

MINUS: Negative evidence -- facts which do not support the estimate -- shall be 
given if known.  Exceptional circumstances (that is, why we do not believe 
these are relevant) can be explained.

CREDIBLE: Credibility of the evidence shall be classified on a scale of 1.0 
(perfect) to 0.0 (worthless).
