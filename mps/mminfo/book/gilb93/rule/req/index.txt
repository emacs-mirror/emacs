SEP: Functional requirements (those without scale) shall be clearly separated 
from attribute requirements (those with scale).

NUM: Attribute requirements (benefit and costs) shall be specified measurably 
and testably (scale and test).

PLANGUAGE: The parameters for describing attributes are scale, test, past, 
record, must, plan, and other language elements described in the "Quality 
Planning" book [a manuscrip by Gilb].

RESULT: Requirements must be stated in terms of final needs, not perceived 
means (these means are solutions and must be stated separately).
