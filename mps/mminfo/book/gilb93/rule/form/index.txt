PAGE: No form shall ever exceed a single page.

CONSISTENT: Forms shall use terminology consistent with procedures, rules, 
exit, and entry criteria, and any other written material used by those who use 
the forms.

INSTRUCT: Forms shall contain as many instructions as necessary for correct use 
on the form itself.  The back of the page might be used for additional 
information if necessary.

CODES: Whenever possible, codes (or at least the most frequent ones) shall be 
on the form so that a tick or circle shall be all that is necessary.  The 
decoding of an abbreviation shall be given if possible (for example, "M(ajor)").

USER: The forms shall be optimised for ease or learning and use by all users 
(readers as well as writers), then for correct and meaningful information.
