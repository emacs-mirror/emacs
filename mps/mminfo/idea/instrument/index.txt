MM.IDEA.INSTRUMENT: Instrumenting the cost of C as feedback to scheduling

I have an idea that we should instrument our code with timing
estimates in terms of an architecture-independent metric.

Suppose I define a time quantum called a `tick' which corresponds to
some notional unit of time, say, one instruction on a notional RISC
processor in the absence of a cache.  I can then examine the output of
various compilers and come up with an approximate tick period for
every C contruct given a naive compilation.  I can then build
approximate bounding period estimates for every function in my code.

I can feed this information to my process (time) management
infrastructure so that it can make accurate timing estimates and
deliver real-time performance to the client.
