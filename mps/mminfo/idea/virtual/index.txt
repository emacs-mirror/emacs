MM.IDEA.VIRTUAL: Virtual memory management

A pool manages memory, but where does it come from?  The pool could
talk to the operating system, or to an abstraction of the operating
system services, but why not make that abstraction exactly the same as
a pool?  A pool would then get its memory from another pool.

The advantages would be in flexibility, and testability, since a pool
could, for example, take advantage of the auditing ability of another
pool.  This might also reduce code volume by eliminating the need for
a separate interface for operating-system services.
