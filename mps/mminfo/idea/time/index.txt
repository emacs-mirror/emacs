SUMMARY

Time can be used to refine refsets.  Timestamp refsets when they are updated, 
timestamp segments when they are created.  Refsets cannot refer to segments 
that were created after the refset was updated.  Optimization:  When an object 
is moved to a new segment (copy collected, compacted), you could update the 
referent refsets and timestamps to "now", but that is an information losing 
operation.  Instead, set the timestamp of the destination segment to the 
timestamp of the source segment.  As more objects are added, update the 
destination segment timestamp to the earliest source segment timestamp.
