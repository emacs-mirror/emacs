MM.IDEA.INTERFACE: General memory management interface

The client programmer should be able to apply the memory manager in
various different situations.  The programmer will not, in general,
know his own detailed requirements on memory management in advance.
He does not want to specify early which particular memory management
policy (see MM.IDEA.FRAME) to use for a particular class of memory,
although he may know that classes of memory exist.

The idea is to provide an interface which late-binds the choice of
memory management policy.  Something like this:

  pool = PoolCreate(policyChoice);
    :
  p = Allocate(pool, ...);
  Free(pool, ...);
    :
  PoolDestroy(pool);

This interface does not tie down the choice of pool at the site of
allocation, where the memory is actually managed, but allows the
choice to be made easily at later stages of development.
