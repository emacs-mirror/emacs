MM.IDEA.META: Meta-requirements

It is not possible to specify a set of detailed requirements which
will provide general memory management services (MM.GOAL.CENTRAL,
MM.GOAL.REVENUE).  It is therefore a requirement that we are able to
meet _classes_ of requirement, the specific details of which will vary
from application to application, and which we cannot predict
accurately in advance.
