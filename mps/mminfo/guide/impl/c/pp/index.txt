INTRODUCTION

.scope: This document describes the MM Group convention for using the C 
preprocessor.

.readership: This document is intended for anyone working on or with MM Group 
source code.


PREPROCESSING

.layout: Don't indent preprocessor directives.

.ifdef: Don't use #ifdef to control dependencies on the target environment.  
Separate the target-dependent parts of the code into a separate implementation 
of a module, and name that accordingly (see guide.impl.c.naming.file.env).
