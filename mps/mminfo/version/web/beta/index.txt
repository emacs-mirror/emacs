NOTES

.notes: 

Harlequin's Memory Management Group have prepared the "Memory Management
Reference", a set of web pages containing a glossary, bibliograph, FAQ, and
other resources.  We plan to release these pages to the general public on
Friday 10th January 1997, but we'd like to give you a chance to review and
comment on the pages now.

The pages are available at <URL:http://www.harlequin.com/mm/reference/>.

Please don't pass on this URL until after the public release.  We'll send
you another message when the launch occurs.

Please send any comments to mm-web@harlequin.com.  During the Beta Review
period we will reply personally to all comments as soon as we can.  It
would be helpful if you could forward any comments by Monday 6th January
1997 so we have time to act on them before the release.

http://www.harlequin.com/mm/reference/ says:

> Welcome to The Memory Management Reference -- a resource for everyone
> interested in memory management and garbage collection.  ...  These
> pages concentrate some of the best knowledge in the field.  We encourage
> you not only to use this resource, but to improve it by sending us
> feedback and submitting new material for consideration.

Thanks for your time.  We look forward to hearing from you.
