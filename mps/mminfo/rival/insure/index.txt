.overview: Insure++ is ParaSoft's flagship product -- a comprehensive C++ 
developer's error detection tool which includes detection of memory related 
errors.  "Using Insure++, you will produce more robust, better optimized, and 
higher quality software."  The most significant and relevant thing about

memory usage.  It is the only tool known to do so.  Insure++ is available on 
Windows NT, Windows 95, Sun/Sparc (SunOS 4.x, Solaris 2.x), IBM RS/6000, DEC 
Alpha (Digital Unix, OpenVMS), HP 9000/7xx, Lynx Realtime OS, NEC, Pyramid, 
Sequent, Silicon Graphics, Intel x86 (SCO, Linux, BSD, etc.), and, they claim, 
"many more".
