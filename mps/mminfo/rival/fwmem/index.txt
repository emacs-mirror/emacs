FwMem is a manual mm service in the (EP/GUI) FrameWork.

Ultimately, ScriptWorks uses fwmem for everything (except core RIP).  Its 
interface is an improvement on malloc/free.  It has code for various debugging 
checks, but is not otherwise all that 'mature'.  It does simple manual mm on 
top of whatever the platform provides for an application to allocate out of 
(malloc/free, or NewPtr/DisposePtr on MacOS).

See mail.richardk.1998-04-01.13-51 for feature list, or read the header file 
HQNframework_os!export:fwmem.h.
