.intro: BGET is a manual allocator with debugging features, implemented in 
portable C (also available in UNIVAC 1108 assembly).  It was written by John 
Walker, co-creator of AutoCAD, and is in the public domain.  It is quite 
configurable through compile-time options.  It is old, stable, and has been 
ported to many systems.

.desc: From the website: "Useful for stand-alone (embedded systems) use and as 
a replacement for malloc and other system-provided allocators which may be too 
slow or
otherwise unattractive.  Layering this package under the Microsoft Windows 3.1 
allocator, for example, sped up some programs by a factor of 10.  Extensive 
diagnostic and debugging support is provided, to help find memory leaks, 
clobbered buffers, use of pointers to released buffers, etc."

.names: For historical reasons, what the client gets from BGET are called 
"buffers" -- just read "block" for that.

.arch: Architecture is similar to MPS with a single pool and a client arena.  
The arena (called "buffer pool") can be extended explicitly, or you can specify 
callbacks to extend and contract the arena.  .arch.compact: There's also an 
optional low-memory callback (called "compact function").
