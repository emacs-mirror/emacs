ZeroFault Overview 

ZeroFault is the tool you need to effectively detect and eliminate memory 
errors and leaks in any AIX program. It checks every instruction and every 
system call, whether in your code or someone else's. ZeroFault uses advanced 
virtual machine technology to detect memory errors and leaks in the program's 
actual runtime environment. 

ZeroFault is fast and easy to use. There's no relinking, no recompiling, and no 
source code required. The intuitive graphical user interface allows you to 
quickly identify those errors that are lurking in your program, just waiting to 
cause problems.
