UltraHeap is a manual allocation library for VC++ 6.0.  The website 
<URL:http://members.tripod.com/~radosoft/UltraHeap/> says:

UltraHeap is a C++ memory allocation accelerator, offering significant speed 
improvement (typically between 3 and 50 times) over the memory allocation 
routines supplied by compiler vendors and other third party heap manager 
libraries. It can either replace the global C++ new() and delete() operators, 
or alternatively define API containing memory allocation routines. 

UltraHeap is not a 'real' heap manager. It is build on the top of existing ANSI 
C memory allocation API (malloc/realloc/free).

UltraHeap is not a debugging tool. Its abilities to catch errors exist, but are 
very limited.

It sounds rather simple, but they've done all the fancy footwork required to 
make it work with VC++ in all its different configurations.

The web site has a link to the MM Reference -- and to MicroQuill (SmartHeap).
