HeapManager is an allocator and heap debugging tool for Macintosh programs 
written in Metrowerks C/C++. Details at <htpp://www.biit.com/>. They also claim 
to have some benchmark applications for memory allocation, but when I tried to 
download them the host (ftp.biit.com) didn't seem to exist. Ho hum.
