Hoard is a freeware drop-in replacement for malloc, specially written for 
multiprocessors.  The benchmarks are impressive, the paper (paper.bb99) seems 
professional, and the price is right.  This is what their website 
<URL:http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/emery/hoard/> says:

Hoard is a fast, scalable and memory-efficient allocator that solves the heap 
contention problem caused by multiple threads calling dynamic memory allocation 
functions like malloc() and free() (or new and delete).  Hoard can dramatically 
improve the performance of multithreaded programs running on multiprocessors.

It's written by Berger and Blumofe, from Paul Wilson's group in Texas.
