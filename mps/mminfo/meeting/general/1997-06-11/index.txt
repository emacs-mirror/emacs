INTRODUCTION

.intro: NIck met Richard to discuss general progress and later Gavin to discuss 
the Web product.

GENERAL

.ml: Release dates for ML 2.0m1 and 2.0b0 in ML ProdEv are two weeks wrong - 
they have slipped along with m0. (Corresponding dates in ML Info and MM ProdEv 
were correct. Did somebody mention Eternal??)

.releases: Nick and Richard reviewed the status of releases in each MM product, 
and made a few changes. 

.releases.approve: Richard noted that there has been no formal approval of 
releases made to other groups. Did they meet their requirements? (.act.pdms)

.releases.epcore.gc: Requirements exist, but no scheduling. gc release will 
remove glue layer. (.act.pdms)

WEB

.discuss: Nick and Gavin discussed changes and requests in the Web product, and 
Gavin explained how changes are assigned. Trapdoor release looks on course.

ACTIONS

.act.ml: Nick will correct ML ProdEv release dates (.ml) 

.act.pdms: Nick will talk to other PdMs about release approval. 
(.releases.approve), and requirements / timescales for future work. 
(.releases.*)

.act.ms_project: Nick will create a MS Project document containing what little 
intelligence he has about future MM product schedules.

.act.web: Gavin will move as many of the "Web/Defining" tasks as make sense to 
"Scheduling". He will offer them around the group - each developer to pick up 4 
changes which will be scheduled for the Money release
