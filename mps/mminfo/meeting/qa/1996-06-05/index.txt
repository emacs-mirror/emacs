INTRODUCTION

.intro: Richard Brooksby met Mark Preece by telephone on 1996-06-05 to discuss 
QA resource requirements in preparation for the MM Quartet meeting on 
1996-05-07.


NOTES

.hire: We need to hire.

.interest: The MM opportunity is interesting enough to tempt someone in.

.uk: Hiring in the UK would make more sense.

.embed: The new person should participate in the testing of the memory manager 
embedded within other products.  For example, they would be involved in 
ScriptWorks QA with specific responsibilities for exercising the memory manager.

.early-sw: Aside: Mark: Early QA of the MM as part of SW could be difficult.  
Richard: That's no problem.  We will conduct internal tests within the group 
and wait for full QA of SW+MM prior to release.  The MM Group will get 
resources (test suites, etc.) for SW testing from QA without burdening them too 
much.

.list: Richard will set up mm-qa mailing list, initially containing mayme, 
rthor, mm, and mwp.

.job: Mark will generate a job description for the new QA person and run it by 
Richard.  It will be discussed with Alex and raised at the Quartet meeting 
before going to HR.  We need someone who is a developer, with C/C++, and 
ideally a Windows application developer.  We could tempt someone by offering 
future development opportunities, provided they do a good stint in QA.


ACTIONS

.act.job: Mark to generate job description and discuss with Alex.

.act.list: Richard to set up mailing list and review job description.


NEXT MEETING

.next: We will meet at the MM Quartet meeting on 1996-05-07.
