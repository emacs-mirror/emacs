.intro: GavinM and DRJ met briefly with Tony to discuss priorities for 
version.dylan.meadow-lark.

.conc: The conclusion of the meeting was that request.dylan.170440 (heap 
walker), scheduled for release.dylan.box-turtle, was far more urgent than 
request.dylan.170554 (cons counter) and request.dylan.170087 (not failing 
allocations), scheduled for release.dylan.meadow-lark.  Their schedules should 
therefore be reversed.
