INTRODUCTION

Richard Brooksby and Tucker Withington met Kim Barett at 1CC on 1995-11-09 to 
discuss interfacing between Dylan/DylanWorks and the Memory Pool System.


ITEMS DISCUSSED

- Pointers into the middle of objects to support negative offset slots.
- Dylan libraries for control over the Memory Manager.
- Low-level (run-time) interfacing to the Memory Manager.


ACTIONS

kab       Read trough Tucker's old Dylan/MM proposals
richard   Study the interior pointer question and estimate costs.
kab       Look at the current MM/Dylan run-time interface (DW layer)
mm        Define the MPS interface and document it.
kab       Think about what might be added to wrappers.
kab       Consult Dylan group about MM controls.
kab       Think about levels of access to MM controls.
richard   Write up model of use of MM.
mm        Define low-level interface to weak and final references.
kab       Think about language-level requirements for MM control.
mm        Define low-level rehashing interface.


OBJECTIVES

- Plan what will happen to the "dw" layer of the MM/Dylan interface.
- Develop a model or vision of MM use by Dylan.
- Plan for implementation of "interior" pointers.
- Develop Dylan libraries for memory management.


POST-MEETING NOTES

- Richard will be working on the MPS Interface between 1995-11-21 and 23.
