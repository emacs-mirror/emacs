Nick Levine, Gavin Matthews and Tony Mann met briefly to discuss the terms of  
req.dylan.attr.space.boot, which states that "the total overhead, including the 
MM code, should be no more than 50Kb".

Previous meeting.dylan.1996-07-31.attr.space.boot   stated that "The total 
overhead, including the MM code, should be no more than 50Kb.  50% for B, 100% 
for D." (where B was the Kansas release, which MM will support with its 
cottonwood release, and D means "eventually").

Tony agreed that the interpretation that "the total overhead, including the MM 
code, should be no more than 100Kb for cottonwood" was satisfactory, though 
they would appreciate the 50K limit at some point in the future. 

Essentially, they want the MM to be sufficiently small to be unobtrusive.
