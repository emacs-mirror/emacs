INTRODUCTION

.intro: Richard Brooksby <richard> met Andy Sizer <andys>, Tony Mann <tony>, 
and Peter Benson <pabenson> to discuss the Dylan requirement for finalization.


SUMMARY OF DISCUSSION

.fathom: We tried to fathom the reasons for the ordering constraints in the 
Apple Scheme (ref?) and couldn't.  .ole: Some discussion of OLE's requirements 
was done, but we didn't know enough about it to come to any conclusions.



SUMMARY OF DECISIONS

.postpone: The MM Group will assume that finalization is required, but that 
ordering constraints on the finalization of groups of inter-referenced 
finalized objects are not required, until the Dylan Group can produce a 
compelling reason to have them.


ACTIONS

.act.ole: Richard will discuss OLE's requirements for finalization with Scott 
McKay when he goes to 1CC in August. [this meeting never happened - drj]

.act.apple: The Dylan Group will attempt to discover the rationale behind the 
ordering constraings mentioned in the Apple Scheme.
