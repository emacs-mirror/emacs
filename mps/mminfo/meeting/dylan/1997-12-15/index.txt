.intro: GavinM talked briefly to Tony about the confused interpretation of 
req.dylan.attr.space.boot, in the light of meeting.dylan.1997-09-04(0) and 
meeting.dylan.1997-07-02(0).  

.cottonwood: It was decided that the requirement for cottonwood was that the 
additional memory used (both allocated and for swapped in code) by creating the 
space should be less than 150k.  It is believed to be 124k in practice.

.future: In some future version, the target is 50k, but the cost of this should 
be assessed.
