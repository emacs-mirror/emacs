INTRODUCTION

.intro: On Tuesday 13th September 1995 Richard Brooksby met with Yoryos 
Yeracaris to discuss the status of the EP requirements process and the EP goal 
statement, and to plan future work.

.scope: The meeting mainly covered the document goal.epcore.


GOALS

.agree: Yoryos agreed the goals, but requested that we add "debuggability" as a 
goal: to assist with the debugging of the RIP and help locate faults throughout 
the system.

.debug.self: The system should also be self-debugging, but this is implied by 
the reliability goal.

.prio: Priorities:
.prio.1: Reliability.
.prio.2: Equal performance to existing system.
.prio.3: Garbage collection of PostScript VM.
.prio.4: Debugging assistance.
.prio.5: Performance enhancement.
.prio.6: Downsizing of ScriptWorks.

.dollars: Yoryos pointed out that there are millions of dollars worth of 
equipment hanging off the software.  We can't afford much failure.

.odd: One in one-hundred users may stumble across the odd problem after having 
run the RIP for a week solid.

.cond: "Strange" jobs may sometimes fail and get patched for the next release, 
but common jobs must be fixed immediately.


PLANNING

.cut: The next major release is March/April 1996.  If reliability and 
performance are good enough we could cut over to the new memory manager for 
that release.

.cut.nogc: It'd be better to cut over without GC to ensure stability.

.req: Richard will produce a draft requirements document, circulate and field 
comments, and have a draft for review by the end of October.  Ask Brad Hampson 
for the list of people to distribute it to after having comments from Andy Cave 
and Luke Tumner.
