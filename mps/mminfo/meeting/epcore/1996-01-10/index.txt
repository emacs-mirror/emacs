.intro: On Wednesday 10th January 1996, Nick Barnes met Keith Passaretti, the 
new EP Director, to inform him in general terms of the MM/EP-core project.

.outline: Nick outlined the MM/EP-core project, explaining that ScriptWorks 
currently does no garbage collection, and has some other memory management 
shortcomings, that it had been felt that the Memory Management Project should 
provide new memory management software for ScriptWorks, and that a goals and 
requirements process has been proceeding for sometime.

.meeting: It was agreed that a further meeting should take place, with Richard, 
Keith, and Nick, between the 22nd and the 25th of January (when Richard is back 
in the UK), to pursue the outstanding EP management issues from MM/EP-core.

.info: Keith looked briefly at the Memory Management Information System.

.req: Nick showed Keith the requirements document req.epcore, and sketched its 
contents.

.test: Keith raised the issue of acceptance testing, and Nick explained that 
this was an outstanding point following discussions with people from SW/QA.

.goals: Nick showed Keith the MM/EP-core goals goal.epcore, and we briefly 
discussed them.

.deliv: Nick outlined the four-phase delivery proposal (see 
design.epcore.overview.deliv), and the basic reasons for it. The need for EP 
developer work for integrating the first phase (the Layered Memory Manager) was 
discussed briefly.
