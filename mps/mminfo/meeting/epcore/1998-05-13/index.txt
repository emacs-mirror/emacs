INTRODUCTION

.intro: Gavin Matthews <GavinM> met briefly with Dave T Berry <DTB> to discuss 
some issues of MM/EP-Core scheduling.


TRAPPING

.trapping: Gavin explained that the change to allocate trapping memory from a 
new pool, of class EPDL, (that Dave is currently back-porting to SW_B1) has 
three potential effects on fragmentation:

  .trapping.not-mv: The trapping memory is not managed by the MV pool class.  
This is a very good thing because MV has a generally poorer placement policy, 
and in particular cannot allocate across segment boundaries.

  .trapping.not-temp: Trapping objects are no longer placed adjacent in memory 
to temp pool objects.  This is a good thing because temp pool objects are not 
as temporary as trapping objects.

  .trapping.beside-dl: Segments used for trapping memory are placed adjacent to 
those used for display list memory.  The effect of this is not entirely known, 
but it is believed (from traces, etc.) to be safer.

.trapping.conclusion: MM's conclusion is that the combination of these effects 
(resulting from Dave's change to SW_B1 described in .trapping above) is 
believed to solve the trapping fragmentation problems observed.  As a result, 
no patch to MM's version.epcore.trapping is required at the moment.

.trapping.contingency: If subsequent testing shows the analysis of 
.trapping.beside-dl to be wrong, then version.epcore.trapping could be patched 
(to keep trapping segments separate) at one week's notice at more-or-less any 
time.


MINNOW

.minnow: Dave confirmed that SW 5.0 full beta will now definitely have a 
development freeze no earlier than 1998-05-29, and will probably have a 
development freeze in mid 1998-06.  He will keep MM informed of changing 
schedules.
