INTRODUCTION

.intro: Richard Brooksby <richard> met Nick Barnes <nickb> by phone to discuss 
the recent MM/EPCore trapping beta release (version.epcore.trapping.beta).


NOTES

.no-sw: Release has been hampered (again) by the fact that we are unable to get 
working ScriptWorks to test.

.unwind: We can unwind this release by simply changing HOPE compound structure 
(SWprod), so there's little risk.

.approval: We had approval from Dave Berry and Keith Passeratti, who were keen 
to have this done on Friday.

.next: We'll do a further release this week, after merging with trunk of 
MMsrc.  We need to get configuration sorted out at least, and maybe keyargs.

.msg: We must send a message to EP developers making it clear what the status 
of the release is.  It's intended to be hammered by EP developers and QA.  We 
expect some problems, and will respond quickly to problem reports.  Also make 
the point that it is easy to revert.

.int: We also need to try to fix SW integration problem -- the problem that 
Nick has to spend ages trying to build ScriptWorks.  Having Simon Green 
available from the Core RIP Group helps.  (See also .no-sw.)

.notes: Nick should keep notes, as we'll need to analyse this whole process 
later.


ACTIONS

.act.meet: Richard and Nick will meet this week to resolve design issues in 
Nick's branch before merging it into the trunk.
