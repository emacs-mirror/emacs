INTRODUCTION

.intro: Richard Brooksby <richard> and Gavin Matthews <gavinm> met Andi Hindle 
<andih> to discuss the issue of graphic design of the Memory Management Web 
Pages.


DECISIONS

.delay: Given the intention to release the web pages by 1996-10-18, other 
pressures on Andi and Georgina, the time it would take for proper consultation, 
and the imminent (1996-10-21) marketing meeting and subsequent redesign of the 
corporate web pages, it was decided to release the pages without graphics, but 
with attention given to good textual design.


ACTIONS

.act.text: Andi will look at the pages and forward comments on the textual 
design of the pages by 1996-10-04.
