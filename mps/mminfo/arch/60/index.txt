Pre-processor symbol: MPS_ARCH_60
Align mod: 8
Address width: 32


There is some question about the minimum alignment.  Does it really need to be 
8, or is this just for efficiency? [I think it's 4 -- drj]

If we ever specialize to 68020 &c, the architecture name will be 6<n>, where 
the processor family is 680<n>0.
