Pre-processor symbol: MPS_ARCH_PP
Align mod: 8
Address width: 32


.32: Note that this designates the 32-bit implementation of the POWER 
architecture.

.64.other: The 64-bit implementation should use a different architecture code. 
(arch.pq?)

.mac: Aspects of this processor relevant when using MacOS are documented in 
"Mac OS Runtime Architecture", book.apple1997(0).  This includes: alignments 
for datatypes in C, stack layouts, register usage conventions.

.align: The alignment of 8 is derived from table 4-2 in Chapter 4 of "Mac OS 
Runtime Architecture".
