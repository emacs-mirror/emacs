From pages O-17 - O-18 of paper.sei93:

At the Optimizing Level, the entire organization is focused on continuous 
process improvement. The organization has the means to identify weaknesses and 
strengthen the process proactively, with the goal of preventing the occurrence 
of defects. Data on the effectiveness of the software process is used to 
perform cost benefit analyses of new technologies and proposed changes to the 
organization's software process. Innovations that exploit the best software 
engineering practices are identified and transferred throughout the 
organization.


Software project teams in Level 5 organizations analyze defects to determine 
their causes. Software processes are evaluated to prevent known types of 
defects from recurring, and lessons learned are disseminated to other projects.

The software process capability of Level 5 organizations can be characterized 
as continuously improving because Level 5 organizations are continuously 
striving to improve the range of their process capability, thereby improving 
the process performance of their projects. Improvement occurs both by 
incremental advancements in the existing process and by innovations using new 
technologies and methods.
