Description:

The estimator has the job of estimating the cost of things, namely equipment, 
people, tasks.  Cost is measured in dollars ultimately, but time estimation is 
important also.  The estimator is responsible for ensuring that the Resource 
Manager is never at a loss for not knowing the cost of something.
