NAME

MPS_RM_CONST


SUMMARY

"MPS_RM_CONST" is a constant used in root mode arguments to indicate constant 
roots.


ASSOCIATED PROTOCOLS

Root.


TYPE

Integral constant.


RESOURCES

mps.h


DESCRIPTION

"MPS_RM_CONST" is a preprocessor macro defining a constant that can be OR'ed to 
other "MPS_RM_*" constants, and passed as the root mode argument to certain 
root creation functions ("mps_root_create", "mps_root_create_fmt", 
"mps_root_create_table", "mps_root_create_table_masked", "mps_root_create_reg"
).

Passing "MPS_RM_CONST" means that the client program will not change the root 
after it is declared.  I.e., scanning the root will produce the same set of 
references every time.  Furthermore, for formatted and table roots, the client 
program may not write to the root at all.


EXAMPLE

res = mps_root_create_table(&mmRoot, arena, MPS_RANK_EXACT, MPS_RM_CONST,
                            (mps_addr_t)&Objects, rootCOUNT);
