NAME

mps_fmt_class_t


SUMMARY

"mps_fmt_class_t" is a function pointer type for the class method of a format.  
The method returns an address associated with the class or type of an object.  
As part of the format protocol, a class method must be of this type.


ASSOCIATED PROTOCOLS

Format.  Telemetry.


TYPE

typedef mps_addr_t (*mps_fmt_class_t)(mps_addr_t);


ARGUMENTS

The argument to the class method must be the address of the object whose class 
is of interest.


RETURNED VALUES

The class method must return an address that the client associates with the 
class or type of the object.


EXCEPTIONS

Not applicable.


RESOURCES

None.


DESCRIPTION

When registering a format of variety B (see "mps_fmt_create_B"), you register a 
class method of this type.  The client may have objects that represent classses 
or types.  These may be associated with strings via mps_telemetry_intern and 
mps_telemetry_label.  It is recommended that NULL be returned for padding 
objects or forwarded objects.


EXAMPLE

mps_addr_t my_class_method(mps_addr_t object) {
  my_object_generic_t generic_object = object;
  return (mps_addr_t)(generic_object.class);
}


ERROR HANDLING

A class method is not allowed to fail, but may return NULL.
