NAME

mps_pool_check_fenceposts


SUMMARY

Check all the fenceposts in the pool.


ASSOCIATED PROTOCOLS

Debug


SYNTAX

void mps_pool_check_fenceposts(mps_pool_t pool)


ARGUMENTS

pool   the pool whose fenceposts are to be checked


RESOURCES

mps.h


DESCRIPTION

This function is a debugging feature to check all the fenceposts in the pool.  
If a corrupted fencepost is found, an assert will fire.  It is only useful to 
call this on a debug pool that had fenceposting turned, it does nothing on 
other pools.


EXAMPLE

mps_pool_check_fenceposts(gene_pool);


ERROR HANDLING

If a corrupted fencepost is found, an assert will fire.  You can install an 
assert handler using "mps_assert_install", but you'll probably want to look at 
the problem with a debugger instead.


SEE ALSO

symbol.mps.c.mps_assert_install, symbol.mps.c.mps_class_*_debug


NOTES

None.


INTERNAL NOTES

I know there's no Debug protocol, but there should be.  It could explain the 
basics about debug pools, and the concept of fenceposting.  I don't think 
there's any point in writing it now, since the debug pools are going to get 
redesigned and our current customers know the rest.  pekka 1998-09-11
