DESCRIPTION

"mps_arena_park" puts the specified arena into the parked state.  While an 
arena is parked, no object motion will occur and the staleness of location 
dependencies will not change. All references to objects loaded while the arena 
is parked will keep the same binary representation until after it is released.  

No collection will occur at all. If an arena is in the parked state, it is 
necessarily not in the middle of a collection.
