DESCRIPTION

This method returns the "finalization reference" property of the specified 
message in the specified arena.  The message must be of a message type that 
supports this method.  Currently, the only such type is that of finalization 
messages, as returned by "mps_message_type_finalization".

Note that the reference returned is subject to the normal constraints such as 
moving collection, if appropriate.  For this reason, it is returned indirectly 
via "object_ref" to enable the client to place it directly into scanned memory, 
without imposing the restriction that the C stack be a root.

Note that the invocation of this method does not affect the liveness of the 
specified message and hence the liveness of the object referred to by 
"object_ref.  Use "mps_message_discard" to discard messages.
