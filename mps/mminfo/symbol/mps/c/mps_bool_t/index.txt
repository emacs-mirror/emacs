DESCRIPTION

When used as an input parameter to the MPS, a value of 0 indicates "false" and 
any other value indicates "true".  As an output parameter or function return 
from the MPS, 0 indicates "false", and 1 indicates "true".  Note that an 
"mps_bool_t" value can be used in a conditional context, such as in an "if" 
statement.

    mps_ld_add(&ld, space, obj);
  }
