NAME

mps_fmt_skip_t


SUMMARY

"mps_fmt_skip_t" is a function pointer type for the skip method of a format.  
The skip method returns the address just past the end of the object.  As part 
of the format protocol, a skip method must be of this type.


ASSOCIATED PROTOCOLS

Format.


SYNTAX

Not applicable.


STRUCTURE

Not applicable.


TYPE

typedef mps_addr_t (*mps_fmt_skip_t)(mps_addr_t);


ARGUMENTS

The argument to the skip method must be the address of the object to be skipped.


INITIAL/DEFAULT VALUES

Not applicable.


RETURNED VALUES

The skip method must return the address just past the end of the object.


EXCEPTIONS

Not applicable.


RESOURCES

Not applicable.


DESCRIPTION

When registering a format (see "mps_fmt_create_A"), you register a skip method 
of this type.  The skip method takes the address of an object and returns the 
address just past the end of the object.  It should not be invoked on a 
forwarded object.


EXAMPLE

mps_addr_t my_skip_method(mps_addr_t object) {
   char *p = (char *)object;
   my_object_t my_object = (my_object_t)object;

  return((mps_addr_t)(p + my_object->length));
}


ERROR HANDLING

A skip method is not allowed to fail.


SEE ALSO
