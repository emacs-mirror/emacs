DESCRIPTION

"mps_message_type_t" is the type whose values are the various message types.  
It is opaque.


EXAMPLE


SEE ALSO

symbol.mps.c.mps_message_*

Currently only one message type is implemented, that for finalization messages.


INTERNAL NOTES

"mps_message_type_t" is opaque, but immediate.  It's like an "mps_res_t", 
except that it has no special (zero) value.  I can't remember how we decided to 
describe that.  GavinM
