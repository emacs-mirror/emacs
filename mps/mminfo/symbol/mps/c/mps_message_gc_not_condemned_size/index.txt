Currently, the only type of message that supports this property is 
mps_message_type_gc; such messages are generated whenever a garbage collection 
completes.  This method returns an approximation to the size of the set of 
objects that were in collected pools (so potentially subject to garbage 
collection), but were not condemned in that collection.
