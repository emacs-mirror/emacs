DESCRIPTION

An object of type "mps_thr_t" is a thread registration.  In a multi-threaded 
environment where incremental garbage collection is used, threads must be 
registered with the MPS so that the MPS can examine their state.

An object of type "mps_thr_t" is obtained using the thread registration 
function "mps_thread_reg".


EXAMPLE

  mps_thr_t this_thread;
  mps_res_t res;

  res = mps_thread_reg(&this_thread, space);
  if(res != MPS_RES_OK) return res;


ERROR HANDLING

Not applicable.
