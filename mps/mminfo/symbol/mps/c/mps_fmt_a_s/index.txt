DESCRIPTION

"mps_fmt_A_s" is the type of a structure.  The type pointer to "mps_fmt_A_s" is 
"mps_fmt_A_t"; it is used to create object formats.

"mps_fmt_A_s" represents a particular collection of methods and values that 
describes an object format.  An object of this type can be used to create an 
object of type "mps_fmt_t".

Broadly speaking, the object formats represented by objects of type 
"mps_fmt_A_s" are suitable for use in copying or moving memory managers.

"mps_fmt_A_s" has the following methods:

     scan, skip, copy, fwd, isfwd, pad

and the following value:

     align

Their use is summarized here, but you may also wish to consult the reference 
documentation for the type of each method and value.

mps_fmt_scan_t scan
Scans an object; that is, it extracts all the references from an object and 
applies "mps_fix" (or a similar function) to each one.  It is called by the MPS 
during any tracing process.

mps_fmt_copy_t copy
Creates a copy of an object.  It may be called by the MPS as part of copying 
garbage collection, for example.

mps_fmt_fwd_t fwd
Replaces an object with a "forwarding object", which points to the new location 
of the object.  It may be called by the MPS as part of copying garbage 
collection.

mps_isfwd_t isfwd
Determines whether an object has been replaced with a forwarding object (see 
"fwd", above) or not.

mps_pad_t pad
Creates an object that contains no references.  Padding objects may be used by 
the MPS to keep things tidy; for example, a padding object may created at the 
end of a page if the space at the end of the page is too small to be worth 
worrying about.
