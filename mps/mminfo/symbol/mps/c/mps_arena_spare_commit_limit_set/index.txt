NAME

mps_arena_spare_commit_limit_set


SUMMARY

Sets the limit of the amount of spare committed memory.


ASSOCIATED PROTOCOLS

Arena.


TYPE

extern void mps_arena_spare_commit_limit_set(mps_arena_t arena, size_t limit)


ARGUMENTS

mps_arena_t arena
  The arena to which the new limit should apply.

size_t limit
  The value of the new limit (specified in bytes).


RESOURCES

mps.h


DESCRIPTION

The limit argument specifies a new "spare commit limit".  The spare commit 
limit specifies the maximum amount of bytes of "spare committed" memory the MPS 
is allowed to have.  Setting it to a value lower than the current amount of 
spare committed memory would immediately cause sufficient spare committed 
memory to be uncommitted so as to bring the value under the limit.  In 
particular setting to 0 will mean that the MPS will have no "spare committed" 
memory.

"spare committed" memory is the term for describing memory which the arena is 
managing as free memory (so not in use by any pool and not otherwise in use for 
obscure internal reasons) but which remains committed (mapped from the OS).  It 
is used by the arena to (attempt to) avoid calling the OS to repeatedly unmap 
and map areas of VM.  "spare committed" memory is counted as committed memory 
as counted by mps_arena_committed and restricted by mps_arena_commit_limit.

Non-VM arenas do not have this concept, but they support the two functions 
mps_arena_spare_commit_limit and mps_arena_spare_commit_limit_set.  The 
functions simply get and retrieve a value but do nothing else in that case.

Initially the value is some configuration-dependent value.

The value of the limit can be retrieved with mps_arena_spare_commit_limit().
