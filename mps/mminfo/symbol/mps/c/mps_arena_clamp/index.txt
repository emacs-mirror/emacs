DESCRIPTION

"mps_arena_clamp" puts the specified arena into the clamped state.  In the 
clamped state, no object motion will occur and the staleness of location 
dependencies will not change.  All references to objects loaded while the arena 
is clamped will keep the same binary representation until after it is released.

In a clamped arena, incremental collection may still occur, but it will not be 
visible to the mutator and no new collections will begin. Space used by 
unreachable objects will not be recycled until the arena becomes unclamped.
