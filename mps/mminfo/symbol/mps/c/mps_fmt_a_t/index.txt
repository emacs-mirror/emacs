NAME

mps_fmt_A_t


SUMMARY

"mps_fmt_A_t" is the type pointer to "struct mps_fmt_A_s".  A value of this 
type represents a collection of methods and values that can be used to create a 
format object of type "mps_fmt_t".  This structure type is transparent.  You 
are expected to declare and create structures of this type if you require an 
object of type "mps_fmt_A_t".

DESCRIPTION

"mps_fmt_A_t" is the type pointer to "struct mps_fmt_A_s".  A value of this 
type represents a collection of methods and values that can be used to create a 
format object of type "mps_fmt_t".  This type represents a particular 
collection of methods and values; other collections are represented by other 
types.

Objects of type "mps_fmt_A_t" are intended to be used in the creation of object 
formats.  Object formats describe the layout of client objects.  The function 
"mps_fmt_create_A" takes an "mps_fmt_A_t" as one of its arguments and creates 
an object of type "mps_fmt_t" (an object format).

See the documentation for the symbol "mps_fmt_A_s" for further details.
