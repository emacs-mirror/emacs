NAME

mps_lib_memcpy


SUMMARY

A plinth function similar to C's "memcpy".


ASSOCIATED PROTOCOLS

Plinth


SYNTAX

void *mps_lib_memcpy(void *dest, const void *source, size_t n);


ARGUMENTS

dest     destination of copy
source   source of copy
n        length of the blocks, in bytes


RETURNED VALUES

Returns the value of the dest argument.


RESOURCES

mpslib.h


DESCRIPTION

This function is intended to have the same semantics as the "memcpy" function 
of the ANSI C standard (section 7.11.2.1).

Like other plinth features, it is used by the MPS and provided by the client 
(possibly using the ANSI plinth, mpsliban.c).


EXAMPLE

None, clients don't use it.


ERROR HANDLING

None.


SEE ALSO

symbol.mps.c.mps_lib_memset, symbol.mps.c.mps_lib_memcmp, mpsliban.c


NOTES

None.


INTERNAL NOTES:

On some platforms and varieties, this function will never be called, because we 
allow the compiler to open-code the operation instead (see impl.h.config).
