NAME

mps_lib_memset


SUMMARY

A plinth function similar to C's "memset".


ASSOCIATED PROTOCOLS

Plinth


SYNTAX

void *mps_lib_memset(void *s, int c, size_t n);


ARGUMENTS

s      destination of copy
c      byte (when converted to an unsigned char) to copy
n      length of the block, in bytes


RETURNED VALUES

Returns the value of s.


RESOURCES

mpslib.h


DESCRIPTION

This function is intended to have the same semantics as the "memset" function 
of the ANSI C standard (section 7.11.6.1).

Like other plinth features, it is used by the MPS and provided by the client 
(possibly using the ANSI plinth, mpsliban.c).


EXAMPLE

None, clients don't use it.


ERROR HANDLING

None.


SEE ALSO

symbol.mps.c.mps_lib_memcpy, symbol.mps.c.mps_lib_memcmp, mpsliban.c


NOTES

None.


INTERNAL NOTES:

On some platforms and varieties, this function will never be called, because we 
allow the compiler to open-code the operation instead (see impl.h.config).
