NAME

mps_fmt_pad_t


SUMMARY

The type of a format's pad method.  A pad method is used to create padding 
objects.


ASSOCIATED PROTOCOLS

Format


TYPE

typedef void (*mps_fmt_pad_t)(mps_addr_t addr, size_t size);


ARGUMENTS

addr
  The address at which to create a padding object.
size
  The size (in bytes) of the padding object to be created.


RETURNED VALUES

N/A


DESCRIPTION

A pad method is provided by the client as part of a format (see 
protocol.mps.format(0)).  The MPS calls a pad method when it wants to create a 
padding object.  Typically the MPS creates padding objects to fill in otherwise 
unused gaps in memory; they allow the MPS to pack objects in fixed sized units 
(such as OS pages).  The pad method should create a padding object of the 
specified size at the specified address.  The size can be any aligned (to the 
format alignment) size.  A padding object should be acceptable to other methods 
in the format (scan, skip, isfwd, etc).
