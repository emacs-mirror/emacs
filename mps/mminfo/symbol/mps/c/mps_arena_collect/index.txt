NAME

mps_arena_collect


SUMMARY

"mps_arena_collect" collects the arena and puts it in the parked state.


ASSOCIATED PROTOCOLS

Arena.


SYNTAX

void mps_arena_collect(mps_arena_t arena);


ARGUMENTS

arena   the arena to collect


RESOURCES

mps.h


DESCRIPTION

"mps_arena_collect" collects the arena and puts it in the parked state.  
Collecting the arena attempts to recycle as many unreachable objects as 
possible and reduce the size of the arena as much as possible (though in some 
cases it may increase because it becomes more fragmented). If you do not want 
the arena to be in the parked state, you must explicitly call 
"mps_arena_release" after "mps_arena_collect".

Note that the collector may not be able to recycle some objects (such as those 
near the destination of ambiguous references) even though they are not 
reachable.


EXAMPLE

[missing]


ERROR HANDLING

No errors.


SEE ALSO

mps_arena_park, mps_arena_release


NOTES

None.


INTERNAL NOTES:

It's been suggested that this function be changed to collect the arena but not 
change the clamp/parkedness of the arena.  This is so that clients that to use 
just for collecting the world (heaven forbid) can use it in the naive way and 
it will work.  Clients wanting to use it to stabilise the world before 
gathering statistics will have to clamp the arena first.
