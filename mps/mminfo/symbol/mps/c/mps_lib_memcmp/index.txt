NAME

mps_lib_memcmp


SUMMARY

A plinth function similar to C's "memcmp".


ASSOCIATED PROTOCOLS

Plinth


SYNTAX

int mps_lib_memcmp(const void *s1, const void *s2, size_t n);


ARGUMENTS

s1, s2   pointers to memory blocks to be compared
n        length of the blocks, in bytes


RETURNED VALUES

An integer that is greater than, equal to, or less than zero, accordingly as 
the block pointed to by "s1" is greater than, equal to, or less than the block 
pointer to by "s2".


RESOURCES

mpslib.h


DESCRIPTION

This function is intended to have the same semantics as the "memcmp" function 
of the ANSI C standard (section 7.11.4.1).

Like other plinth features, it is used by the MPS and provided by the client 
(possibly using the ANSI plinth, mpsliban.c).


EXAMPLE

None, clients don't use it.


ERROR HANDLING

None.


SEE ALSO

symbol.mps.c.mps_lib_memset, symbol.mps.c.mps_lib_memcpy, mpsliban.c


NOTES

None.


INTERNAL NOTES:

On some platforms and varieties, this function will never be called, because we 
allow the compiler to open-code the operation instead (see impl.h.config).
