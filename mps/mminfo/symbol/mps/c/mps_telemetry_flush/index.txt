NAME

mps_telemetry_flush


SUMMARY

This function is used to flush the internal event buffers.


ASSOCIATED PROTOCOLS

Telemetry.


SYNTAX

void mps_telemetry_flush(void);


RESOURCES

mps.h


DESCRIPTION

This function is used to flush the internal event buffers into the event 
stream.  This function also calls "mps_lib_io_flush" on the event stream 
itself.  This ensures that even the latest events are now properly recorded, 
should the application terminate (uncontrollably as a result of a bug, for 
example) or some interactive tool require access to the event data.  You could 
even try calling this from a debugger after a problem.


EXAMPLE

  mps_telemetry_flush();


SEE ALSO

symbol.mps.mps_lib_io_flush


NOTES

None.


INTERNAL NOTES

There are plans to write interactive tools that read event streams.  pekka
