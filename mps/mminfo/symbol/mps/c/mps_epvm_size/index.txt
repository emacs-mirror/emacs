NAME

mps_epvm_size

SUMMARY

Returns the amount of memory in use by an epvm pool.

ASSOCIATED PROTOCOLS

Nil.

SYNTAX

#include <mpsvepvm.h>

extern size_t mps_epvm_size(mps_pool_t /* pool */);

TYPE

As syntax.

ARGUMENTS

mps_pool_t pool
 An instance of Pool Class EPVM (mps_class_epvm()).

INITIAL/DEFAULT VALUES

NA

RETURNED VALUES

Returns a size_t which is the number of bytes currently in use by the pool.

RESOURCES

NA

DESCRIPTION

mps_epvm_size return a size_t which is the number of bytes currently in use by 
the pool.  Bytes are considered in use by this pool if they are allocated from 
the OS and unavailable for use by any other pool in the system.  Certainly this 
value will be at least as large of the number of bytes of currently allocated 
objects (ie objects which have been allocated but not yet freed).  Because the 
OS usually restricts the MPS to requesting memory in page-aligned chunks this 
values may be larger when objects do not conveniently pack contiguously onto 
pages (which can happen as a result of fragmentation due to freeing).

EXAMPLE

ERROR HANDLING

No errors.

SEE ALSO

mps_arena_committed which returns an analogous values for the entire arena.
mps_epvm_free_size which returns the number of bytes that the pool is managing 
that are free.

INTERNAL NOTES

Probably should be deprecated in favour of (as yet unwritten 1998-07-06) 
generic interface.
