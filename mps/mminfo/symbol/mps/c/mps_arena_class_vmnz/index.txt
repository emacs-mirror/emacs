NAME

mps_arena_class_vmnz


SUMMARY

An arena class like "mps_arena_class_vm" but with a different placement policy.


ASSOCIATED PROTOCOLS

Arena


SYNTAX

mps_arena_class_vmnz()


TYPE

mps_arena_class_t mps_arena_class_vmnz(void);


ARGUMENTS

None.


RETURNED VALUES

An arena class.


RESOURCES

mpsavm.h


DESCRIPTION

Returns the VMNZ arena class.  (Stands for Virtual Memory No Zones if you 
really care.)  This class can be passed to mps_arena_create in orer to create a 
VMNZ arena.  This class takes additional parameters in the call to 
"mps_arena_create" (see NOTES below).  The VMNZ arenas used the OS virtual 
memory interfaces to allocate memory.  The chief consequence of this is that 
the arena can manage many more virtual addresses than it needs to commit memory 
to.  This gives it flexibility as to where to place objects.  This class is 
similar to "mps_arena_class_vm" but uses a simpler placement policy (which may 
be beneficial in some circumstances).


EXAMPLE

mps_arena_t arena;

int main(void)
{
  if(mps_arena_create(&arena, mps_arena_class_vmnz(), ARENA_SIZE)
     != MPS_RES_OK) {
    printf("Not enough memory!");
    exit(1);
  }
  /* rest of program */
}



ERROR HANDLING

No errors.


SEE ALSO

mps_arena_create, mps_arena_class_vm


NOTES

Virtual memory arenas are not available on the Mac platforms.  You will get a 
linking error, if you attempt to use this function.

This class takes an extra argument when used in "mps_arena_create" (see 
example).  The extra parameter should be of type "size_t".  It specifies the 
amount of virtual address that this arena should use.  The arena will reserve 
this amount of virtual address from the OS during initialization.  It will not 
subsequently use any more virtual address (compare with "mps_arena_class_vm" 
which can grow).


INTERNAL NOTES:

Need to say why it might differ from mps_arena_class_vm in other ways.
