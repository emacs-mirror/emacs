NAME

mps_telemetry_intern


SUMMARY

This function registers a string with the MPS, and receives a unique identifier 
in return.  This identifier is suitable for use with mps_telemetry_label.


ASSOCIATED PROTOCOLS

Telemetry


TYPE

mps_word_t mps_telemetry_intern(char *)


ARGUMENTS

The function receives a name as a nul-terminated string in the usual C way.  
The string's length should not exceed 256 characters, including nul terminating 
character.  In appropriate varieties this restriction is checked and will cause 
the MPS to issue an ASSERT.  So don't do it.


RETURNED VALUES

The function returns a unique idenifier that may be used to represent the 
string in future.


DESCRIPTION

The intention of this function is to provide an immediate identifier that can 
be used to concisely represent a string for the purposes of 
mps_telemetry_label.  Note that the appropriate settings must be made to the 
telemetry filter (via mps_telemetry_control) before this function is invoked; 
the associate event is of the user kind.


ERROR HANDLING

The string's length should not exceed 256 characters, including nul terminating 
character.  This will cause the MPS to issue an ASSERT in appropriate varieties.
