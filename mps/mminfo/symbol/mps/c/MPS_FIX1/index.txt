NAME

MPS_FIX1


SUMMARY

The macro "MPS_FIX1", together with "MPS_FIX2", is the part of the scanning 
protocol used to indicate references to the MPS.  It may only be used from 
within MPS_SCAN_BEGIN and MPS_SCAN_END.


ASSOCIATED PROTOCOLS

Format.


SYNTAX

MPS_FIX1(mps_ss, ref)


ARGUMENTS

mps_ss    the scan state argument that was passed to the scanning function
ref       a reference within the object being scanned, type mps_addr_t


RETURNED VALUES

Returns a truth value (type mps_bool_t) indicating whether the reference is 
likely to be interesting to the MPS.


RESOURCES

mps.h.


DESCRIPTION

MPS_FIX1 and MPS_FIX2 are a trick to speed up scanning by splitting MPS_FIX 
into two macros.  MPS_FIX1 is a fast test to see if the reference is likely to 
be interesting to the MPS; if it returns false, the scanner can proceed to the 
next reference.  If it returns true, the scan method [can apply further, slower 
tests to it, before deciding to] must invoke MPS_FIX2, which does the actual 
fixing.

This macro may only be used in code textually between MPS_SCAN_BEGIN and 
MPS_SCAN_END.


EXAMPLE

mps_res_t scan_array(mps_ss_t ss, Array object, size_t length)
{
  size_t i;
  mps_res_t res;
  mps_addr_t *array = (mps_addr_t *)object;

  MPS_SCAN_BEGIN(ss)
    for(i = 0; i < length; ++i) {
      mps_addr_t ref = array[i];

      if(MPS_FIX1(ss, ref)) {
        /* if(((Object*)ref)->type == ScannableType) { */
        /* You can do something here, but in the end, you must call MPS_FIX2. */
          res = MPS_FIX2(ss, &array[i]);
          if(res != MPS_RES_OK) return res;
        /* } */
      }
    }
  MPS_SCAN_END(ss);

  return res;
}
