DESCRIPTION

"Spare committed" memory is the term for describing memory which the arena is 
committed from the OS but which is free (so not in use by any pool and not 
otherwise in use for obscure internal reasons).  It is used by the arena to 
(attempt to) avoid calling the OS to repeatedly uncommit and commit areas of VM 
(because calling the OS to commit and uncommit memory is typically expensive).  
"Spare committed" memory can be used for grant client requests; if this is done 
when the MPS would otherwise have had to call the OS to commit more memory then 
the MPS has avoid some OS calls.

"spare committed" memory is counted as part of committed memory.  The amount of 
committed memory can be retrieved with mps_arena_committed (see 
symbol.mps.c.mps_arena_committed).

The amount of "spare committed" memory can be limited by using 
mps_arena_spare_commit_limit_set (see 
symbol.mps.c.mps_arena_spare_commit_limit_set), and the value of that limit can 
be retrieved with mps_arena_spare_commit_limit (see 
symbol.mps.c.mps_arena_spare_commit_limit).  This is analogous to the functions 
for limiting the amount of committed memory.
