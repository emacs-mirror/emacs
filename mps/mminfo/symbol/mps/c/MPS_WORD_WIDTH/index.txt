NAME

MPS_WORD_WIDTH


SUMMARY

MPS_WORD_WIDTH is a preprocessor macro defined in "mpstd.h" to be the width in 
bits of the type MPS_T_WORD (so MPS_WORD_WIDTH == sizeof(MPS_T_WORD) * 
CHAR_BIT).


ASSOCIATED PROTOCOLS

None.


TYPE

Integral constant.


RESOURCES

mpstd.h.


DESCRIPTION

This value is required for the use of the MPS C interface and the 
interpretation of "mps.h".  It is platform-dependent.  It is a power of 2; 
typical values are 32 and 64.  It may be defined by including "mpstd.h" on a 
supported platform, or by defining it to be the width of MPS_T_WORD in bits.


EXAMPLE

#define MPS_WORD_WIDTH 32

MPS_T_WORD, MPS_WORD_SHIFT
