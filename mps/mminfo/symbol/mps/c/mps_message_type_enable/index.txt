NAME

mps_message_type_enable


SUMMARY

"mps_message_type_enable" allows messages of the specified type to be created 
for the specified arena.  Without such enabling, the MPS will, by default, not 
generate any messages of that type.


ASSOCIATED PROTOCOLS

Message.


SYNTAX

void mps_message_type_enable(mps_arena_t arena, mps_message_type_t message_type)


ARGUMENTS

arena -- the arena
message_type -- the message type to be enabled


RETURNED VALUES

None.


RESOURCES

mps.h


DESCRIPTION

This procedure may be used by the client to specify that messages of the 
specified type may be created for the specified arena.  Without such enabling, 
the MPS will by default not generate any messages of that type.

Note that the enabling of messages of a particular type implies that the client 
application will handle and discard message of that type, or the message queue 
may consume unbounded resources.

The client may disable message generation again by means of an equivalent call 
to mps_message_type_disable.


EXAMPLE

[none]


ERROR HANDLING

Never fails.

NOTES

It is permitted to call this function when the message type is already enabled. 
Such a call will have no effect.
