DESCRIPTION

"mps_message_type_gc" returns the type of garbage collection statistic 
messages.  Garbage collection statistic messages are used by the MPS to give 
the client information about garbage collections that have occurred.  Such 
information may be useful in analysing the client's memory usage over time.

The access methods specific to a message of this type are:

  mps_message_gc_live_size -- gives the total size of the condemned objects 
that survived the collection that generated the message

  mps_message_gc_condemned_size -- gives an approximate size for the set of 
objects condemned in the collection that generated the message.

  mps_message_gc_not_condemned_size -- gives an approximate size for the set of 
objects that were in collected pools, but were not condemned in the collection 
that generated the message.


EXAMPLE

{
  mps_message_t message;

  if(mps_message_get(&message, arena, mps_message_type_gc())) {
    size_t live, condemned, not_condemned;

    live = mps_message_gc_live_size(message);
    condemned = mps_message_gc_condemned_size(message);
    not_condemned = mps_message_gc_not_condemned_size(message);

    mps_message_discard(arena, message);

    process_collection_stats(live, condemned, not_condemned);
  }
}


ERROR HANDLING

Cannot fail.
