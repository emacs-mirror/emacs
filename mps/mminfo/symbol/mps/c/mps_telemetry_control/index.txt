NAME

mps_telemetry_control


SUMMARY

This function is used to read and change the filters on the telemetry stream.


ASSOCIATED PROTOCOLS

Telemetry.


SYNTAX

mps_word_t mps_telemetry_control(mps_word_t reset_mask, mps_word_t flip_mask);


ARGUMENTS

reset_mask is a bit mask indicating the bits that should be reset, regardless 
of previous value.

flip_mask is a bit mask indicating the bits whose value should be flipped after 
the resetting.


RETURNED VALUES

The function returns the previous value of the telemetry filter control.


DESCRIPTION

This function is used to read and change the filters on the telemetry stream.  
It is generally for use by tool developers [what tool?  pekka 1998-09-16].

The parameters reset_mask and flip_mask allow specifying any binary operation 
on the filter control.  To use this function for typical operations, the 
parameters should be set as follows:

  Operation   reset_mask   flip_mask
    set(M)         M           M
   reset(M)        M           0
    flip(M)        0           M
    read()         0           0

The significance of the bits is liable to change, but the current values 
(number the least significant bit as zero) are:
  0 -- per space or arena
  1 -- per pool
  2 -- per trace or scan
  3 -- per page (segment)
  4 -- per reference or fix
  5 -- per allocation or object
  6 -- user events (e.g., mps_telemetry_intern)

INTERNAL NOTES

The bits need to be shown with hex and decimal weights as well, and there 
should be an example on using the environment variable.  pekka 1998-09-16
