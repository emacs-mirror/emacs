NAME

mps_epvm_save


SUMMARY

Increments the current save level of an EPVM pool.


ASSOCIATED PROTOCOLS

Allocation point.


SYNTAX

void mps_epvm_save(mps_pool_t pool);


ARGUMENTS

pool      the pool whose save level will be incremented, must be an EPVM pool


RETURNED VALUES

None.


RESOURCES

mpscepvm.h


DESCRIPTION

mps_epvm_save increments the save level of the pool given.   The current save 
level before the save must be smaller than the maximum level specified on pool 
creation.


EXAMPLE

mps_epvm_save_level_t currentSaveLevel;

void doTempJob(Result *res)
{
  mps_epvm_save(pool); ++currentSaveLevel;
  /* calculate result, allocating stuff */
  mps_epvm_restore(pool, --currentSaveLevel);
}


SEE ALSO

mps_epvm_restore, mps_class_epvm, mps_pool_create, mps_epvm_save_level_t


NOTES

mps_epvm_save and mps_epvm_restore form an efficient way of freeing large 
numbers of objects in a single operation, provided that the objects can be 
grouped in save levels in a stack-like fashion.


INTERNAL NOTES

It's not yet clear how this interacts with finalization.
