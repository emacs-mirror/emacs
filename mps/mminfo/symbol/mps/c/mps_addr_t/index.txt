NAME

mps_addr_t


SUMMARY

"mps_addr_t" is the type of addresses managed by the MPS, and also the type of 
references to objects.


ASSOCIATED PROTOCOLS

Allocation, allocation point, format, root, location dependency.


TYPE

typedef void *mps_addr_t;


RESOURCES

mps.h


DESCRIPTION

"mps_addr_t" is the type of addresses managed by the MPS, and also the type of 
references to objects.  It is used in the MPS C interface where the MPS needs 
to pass a pointer to memory that is under the control of the MPS.

In accordance with standard C practice, the value NULL of type "mps_addr_t" 
will never be used to represent the address of an object.


EXAMPLE

  mps_addr_t new_block;
  mps_res_t res;
  thingy *tp;

  res = mps_pool_alloc(&new_block, pool, sizeof(thingy));
  if(res != MPS_RES_OK) return res;
  tp = new_block;


ERROR HANDLING

Not applicable.


SEE ALSO

mps_align_t


INTERNAL NOTES:

It's also the type of "references", but perhaps we should have mps_ref_t to 
make the distinction clear.
