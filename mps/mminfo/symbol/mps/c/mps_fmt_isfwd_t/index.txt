NAME

mps_fmt_isfwd_t

SUMMARY

The type of a format's isfwd ("is forwarded") method.  An isfwd method is used 
to test whether an object has been relocated using the format's forward method.


ASSOCIATED PROTOCOLS

Copying Garbage Collection
format


TYPE

typedef mps_addr_t (*mps_fmt_isfwd_t)(mps_addr_t addr);



ARGUMENTS

addr
  the address of a candidate object.


RETURNED VALUES

Either a null pointer to indicate the object at addr has not been relocated, or 
the new location of the object if there is a forwarding marker at addr 
indicating that the object has been relocated.


DESCRIPTION

An isfwd method is provided by the client as part of a format (see 
protocol.mps.format(0)).  The MPS calls the isfwd method to determine whether 
an object in the heap has been relocated or not.  Objects in the heap are 
relocated using the format's forward method (see symbol.mps.c.mps_fmt_fwd_t(0)
).  When the isfwd method is called the parameter addr will be the address of 
either an object or a forwarding marker created with the forward method.  If it 
is an object (so it has not been relocated) the method should return a null 
pointer; otherwise it is a forward marker indicating the address of the 
relocated object, the address of the relocated object should be returned (this 
should be the same as the 'new' parameter that was passed to the forward method 
that created the forwarding marker).
