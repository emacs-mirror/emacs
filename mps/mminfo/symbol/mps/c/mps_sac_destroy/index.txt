DESCRIPTION

This function destroys a segregated allocation cache.  All memory held in it is 
returned to the associated pool.


EXAMPLE

  res = mps_sac_create(&sac, pool, 3, classes);
  if (res != MPS_RES_OK) {
    printf("Failed to create the allocation cache!"); exit(1);
  }
  /* Use sac. */
  mps_sac_destroy(sac);
  mps_pool_destroy(pool);


SEE ALSO

symbol.mps.c.mps_sac_create, symbol.mps.c.mps_sac_t


NOTES

Destroying the cache might well cause the pool to return some memory to the 
arena, but that's up to the pool's usual policy.

Destroying the cache has no effect on objects allocated through it.
