NAME

mps_align_t


SUMMARY

"mps_align_t" is the type of an alignment.


ASSOCIATED PROTOCOLS

Format, pool, allocation.


TYPE

typedef size_t mps_align_t;


RESOURCES

mps.h


DESCRIPTION

An alignment specifies the address modulus to which all objects in an object 
format must be aligned.  That is, if an alignment of 4 is specified, then the 
address of any object in that format modulo 4 will always be 0.

"mps_align_t" is a transparent type equivalent to the C type "size_t" and must 
be a positive power of 2.

Some pools and allocation protocols accept an alignment as an option that can 
be used to ensure that objects in the pool or objects allocated observe a 
stricter alignment than that of the object format.


EXAMPLE

mps_align_t floatAlign = 4;
mps_align_t doubleFloatAlign = 8;
