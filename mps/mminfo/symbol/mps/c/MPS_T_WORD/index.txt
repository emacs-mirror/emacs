NAME

MPS_T_WORD


SUMMARY

"MPS_T_WORD" is a preprocessor macro defined in "mpstd.h".  It is the name of 
an unsigned integral type that is the same size as an object pointer (so 
sizeof(MPS_T_WORD) == sizeof(void*)).  The exact identity of the type is 
platform-dependent.


ASSOCIATED PROTOCOLS

None.


RESOURCES

mpstd.h.


DESCRIPTION

See summary.


EXAMPLE

#define MPS_T_WORD unsigned long


SEE ALSO

MPS_WORD_SHIFT, MPS_WORD_WIDTH


NOTES


INTERNAL NOTES

This aspect of the MPS interface is liable to change; mpstd.h might be cut down 
or disappear entirely.  If it does, the client may have to define MPS_T_WORD 
before including mps.h.
