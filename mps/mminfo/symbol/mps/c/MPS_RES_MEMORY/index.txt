NAME

MPS_RES_MEMORY


SUMMARY

"MPS_RES_MEMORY" is a result code, indicating that an operation failed because 
it ran out of memory.


ASSOCIATED PROTOCOLS

All.


RESOURCES

mps.h


DESCRIPTION

This result code is returned if an operation could not be completed because 
there wasn't enough memory available.  You need to deallocate something or 
allow the garbage collector to reclaim something to free enough memory, or 
expand the arena (if you're using an arena where that does not happen 
automatically).

Note that failing to acquire enough memory because the arena commit limit would 
have been exceeded is indicated by returning MPS_RES_COMMIT_LIMIT, not 
MPS_RES_MEMORY.

Note that running out of address space (as might happen in virtual memory 
systems) is indicated by returning MPS_RES_RESOURCE, not MPS_RES_MEMORY.
