DESCRIPTION

mps_rank_t is a concrete type.  It is an alias (via the C typedef mechanism) 
for "unsigned int" provided for convenience and clarity.  An object of type 
mps_rank_t can store a value representing one reference rank.  Reference ranks 
are used to conveniently express specific semantics of particular references.  
See "Reference Protocol" (protocol.reference) for descriptions of these 
semantics, and mps_rank_* for the actual ranks used to declare these semantics.

EXAMPLE

Probably won't be used explicitly, most likely to be seen in the prototype 
declaration for other MPS functions.  For example, mps_root_create.
