NAME

MPS_RM_PROT_INNER


SUMMARY

"MPS_RM_PROT_INNER" is a constant used in root mode arguments to indicate 
partially protectable roots.


ASSOCIATED PROTOCOLS

Root.


TYPE

Integral constant.


RESOURCES

mps.h


DESCRIPTION

"MPS_RM_PROT_INNER" is a preprocessor macro defining a constant that can be 
OR'ed to other "MPS_RM_*" contants, and passed as the root mode argument to 
certain root creation functions ("mps_root_create_fmt", 
"mps_root_create_table", "mps_root_create_table_masked").

Passing "MPS_RM_PROT_INNER" means that the MPS may place a hardware write 
barrier on any pages which are entirely covered by the root.  Format methods 
and any scanning function (except for the one for this root) may not write data 
in this root.  They may read it.


EXAMPLE

res = mps_root_create_table(&mmRoot, arena, mps_rank_exact(),
                            MPS_RM_PROT | MPS_RM_PROT_INNER,
                            (mps_addr_t)&Objects, rootCOUNT)


SEE ALSO

mps_root_create_fmt, mps_root_create_table, mps_root_create_table_masked, 
MPS_RM_PROT


NOTES

To specify MPS_RM_PROT_INNER, you must also specify MPS_RM_PROT. The meaning of 
MPS_RM_PROT is overridden by MPS_RM_PROT_INNER.


INTERNAL NOTES

Future meaning: The MPS may place a hardware read and/or write barrier on any 
pages which are entirely covered by the root.  Format methods and scanning 
functions (except for the one for this root) may not read or write data in this 
root.
