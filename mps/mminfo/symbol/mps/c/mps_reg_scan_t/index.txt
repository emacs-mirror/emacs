NAME

mps_reg_scan_t


SUMMARY

Type of root scanning functions for "mps_root_create_reg".


ASSOCIATED PROTOCOLS

Root.


SYNTAX

typedef mps_res_t (*mps_reg_scan_t)(mps_ss_t scan_state, mps_thr_t thread,
                                    void *p, size_t s)


ARGUMENTS

scan_state  a scan state
thread      the thread
p           a value passed through from root registration
s           a value passed through from root registration


RETURNED VALUES

A result code.


RESOURCES

mps.h


DESCRIPTION

This is the type of root scanning functions the client provides to 
"mps_root_create_reg".  These functions will be called, whenever the root needs 
to be scanned, and passed the "p" and "s" values specified in the call to 
"mps_root_create_reg".  


SEE ALSO

mps_root_create_reg, mps_stack_scan_ambig


NOTES

Users are not expected to write any scanning functions of this type.  The one 
function supplied with the MPS, "mps_stack_scan_ambig", should be enough for 
most purposes.


INTERNAL NOTES

Actually, users could not write these functions, since we don't publish any 
interface for examining thread objects (mps_thr_t), nor do we specify how to 
get hold of the saved registers of the current thread.  Pekka 1998-01-23
