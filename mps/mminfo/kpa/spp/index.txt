INTRODUCTION

.scope: This document represents the key process area of Software Project 
Planning, a key area of Level 2 of the Capability Maturity Model, as described 
in paper.sei93.

.readership: This document is intended for anyone involved in project.process.

.purpose: The purpose of Software Project Planning is to establish reasonable 
plans for performing the software engineering and for managing the software 
project.

Software Project Planning involves developing estimates for the work to be 
performed, establishing the necessary commitments, and defining the plan to 
perform the work.

The software planning begins with a statement of the work to be performed and 
other constraints and goals that define and bound the
software project (those established by the practices of the Requirements 
Management key process area). The software planning process includes steps to 
estimate the size of the software work products and the resources needed, 
produce a schedule, identify and assess software risks, and negotiate 
commitments. Iterating through these steps may be necessary to establish the 
plan for the software project (i.e., the software development plan).

This plan provides the basis for performing and managing the software project's 
activities and addresses the commitments to the software project's customer 
according to the resources, constraints, and capabilities of the software 
project.


GOALS

.goal.estimate: Software estimates are documented for use in planning and 
tracking the software project.

.goal.activity: Software project activities and commitments are planned and 
documented.

.goal.agree: Affected groups and individuals agree to their commitments related 
to the software project.
