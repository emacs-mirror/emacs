INTRODUCTION

.scope: This document represents the key process area of Peer Reviews, a key 
area of Level 3 of the Capability Maturity Model, as described in paper.sei93.

.readership: This document is intended for anyone involved in project.process.

.purpose: The purpose of Peer Reviews is to remove defects from the software 
work products early and efficiently. An important corollary effect is to 
develop a better understanding of the software work products and of defects 
that might be prevented.

Peer Reviews involve a methodical examination of software work products by the 
producers' peers to identify defects and areas where changes are needed. The 
specific products that will undergo a peer review are identified in the 
project's defined software process and scheduled as part of the software 
project planning activities, as described in Integrated Software Management.

This key process area covers the practices for performing peer reviews. The 
practices identifying the specific software work products that undergo peer 
review are contained in the key process areas that describe the development and 
maintenance of each software work product.


GOALS

.goal.plan: Peer review activities are planned.

.goal.defect: Defects in the software work products are identified and removed.
