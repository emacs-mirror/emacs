In defense of my case I refer the ladies and gentlmen of the jury to
exhibit 'A': proc.impl.c.guide.name.macro.special

In fact, exhibit 'A' seems to contreven current practice.  See
DequeNodeElement.

ROOT CAUSE:

Lack of clearly stated naming conventions.

SUGGESTIONS:

richard: Change DequeNodeElement to "DEQUENODEEEMENT" throughout the code.
dsm: I would make that              "DEQUENODEELEMENT"
Actually I don't like this convention.  DEQUE_NODE_ELEMENT would be more 
readable.

PROCESS SUGGESTIONS:

richard: Work on the C Style Guide, coding procedure, and rules.
