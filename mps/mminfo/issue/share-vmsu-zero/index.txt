DESCRIPTION:

/dev/zero is opened every time a VM object is created.  If we have multiple VMs 
then we are using up a valuable resource -- fds.  Is there a way we could share 
a single one?

ROOT CAUSE:



SUGGESTIONS:

drj: Could open /dev/zero for each mapping.  What are the costs of this?  
Cheaper than keeping a file handle?

PROCESS SUGGESTIONS:



Resolution: See request.mps.170355
