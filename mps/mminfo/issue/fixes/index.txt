DESCRIPTION:

The tracer uses an object to represent the closure of the generic fix 
function.  This is much to complicated and wastes time.

ROOT CAUSE:



SUGGESTIONS:

The generic fix function should dispatch to an entry point in the pool class of 
the pool containing the object, if that pool is interested.  This could be a 
field in the pool class, or even an entry in the "page table" of the arena!

PROCESS SUGGESTIONS:
