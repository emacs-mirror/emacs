DESCRIPTION:

We have many uncontrolled dependencies on the C library throughout the code 
which may cause problems in satisfying req.dylan.fun.soft.env.standalone and 
requirements arising from meeting.ep.1995-08-08.soft.env

ROOT CAUSE:



SUGGESTIONS:

dsm: Bring std/include/lib.h back to life.  It appears that all C library 
functions were intended to be accessed through this interface.  
req.dylan.fun.soft.env.standalone needs more attention.  We may need to write 
our own version of functions we use.

PROCESS SUGGESTIONS:
