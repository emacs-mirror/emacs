DESCRIPTION:

Pool classes do not free segments.

ROOT CAUSE:



SUGGESTIONS:

Some combination of the following
.free: Free segments when they are empty.
.hwm: Keep track of a per segment high water mark.  A pointer beyond which no 
memory is allocated in this segment.
.hwm.reduce: Reduce this when freeing at end of segment.  This should give good 
behaviour under stack-like use.
.test-empty: Detect when a segment is empty
.test-empty.count: by detecting when number of allocated bytes is zero
.test-empty.hwm: by detecting when hwm is at base of segment


PROCESS SUGGESTIONS:



Resolution: See request.mps.170348
