DESCRIPTION:

The interface is an interim solution for interfacing the run-time system and 
memory manager, and is intended for the "Minimal Collector" release of the MM 
scheduled for 1995-03-17.  The interface may be changed in future releases.  We 
anticipate a more general use of the real MM interface in order to provide 
greater flexibility to the Dylan programmer.
