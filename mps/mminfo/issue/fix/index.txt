DESCRIPTION:

There is little documentation on how TraceFix is supposed to be used.  Whether 
and how this is supposed/allowed to be inlined is not documented.

The TraceFix function needs to be exposed externally.  The protocol for doing 
this and the ways in which it may be inlined need to de defined.  TraceFix may 
return an error.  User defined format->scan methods need to know what to do.
