DESCRIPTION:

functions declared use it.

ROOT CAUSE:



SUGGESTIONS:

i) put #include deque.h in pool.h
or
ii) put #include deque.h in std.h

PROCESS SUGGESTIONS:



Resolver: drj
Resolution process: obsolete
Resolution: This is now irrelevant.  Deques are now rings.  Declarations for rings are in 
mpm.h.  mpm.h is included by nearly everything.
