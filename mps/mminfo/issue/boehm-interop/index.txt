DESCRIPTION:

req.dylan.soft.fun.env.component.gc implies that we might need to function with 
Boehm, and yet Boehm uses VirtualQuery under Win32 to determine where all roots 
are.  This won't work, because we map and unmap regions of memory.  Is it 
really a requirement?  If so, is it possible for us to cooperate with Boehm's 
collector at all?
