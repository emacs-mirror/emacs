DESCRIPTION:

At the moment we do nothing very clever when dealing with large objcets.  In 
amc, fill aborts the current group when an object is too large to fit.  This 
may cause performance problems.


ROOT CAUSE:



SUGGESTIONS:

/* fill could be more clever about large objects by allocating */
/* them their own groups to one side rather than aborting the */
/* current group */


PROCESS SUGGESTIONS:
