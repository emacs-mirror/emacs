DESCRIPTION:

Each pool class defines its own subclass of "Pool".  The instance of the pool 
stuffs a class-specific descriptor structure into a buffer in the Pool 
structure.

ROOT CAUSE:



SUGGESTIONS:

In other places, we subclass by embedding the superclass instance in the 
subclass structure, and use PARENT to get from one to the other.  We should do 
this for pools too, and things would get tidier.  There is a problem in that 
all pool instances are the same size, and the bootstrap can't cope otherwise 
(see issue.bootstrap).
