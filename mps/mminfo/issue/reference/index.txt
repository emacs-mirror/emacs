DESCRIPTION:

We have no definition of what a reference is, and so no way of checking 
reference validity.  Also, out clients won't know quite what to expect.  Maybe 
each pool should define this concept.  What about handles on objects -- is the 
handle the reference, or the pointer to the handle?  How about pools with 
different notions of reference?
