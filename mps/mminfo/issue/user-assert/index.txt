DESCRIPTION:

In impl.c.pool we have PoolNo<method> functions that raise an assertion with 
the function name and "unreachable code".  This could be a lot better, e.g. it 
could state that a specific pool class doesn't provide a specific method.  This 
is a wider problem of how meaningful our user-visible/user-triggerable asserts 
are, and whether the user can act on them without support.

ROOT CAUSE:



SUGGESTIONS:

We could make user comprehension of visible/triggerable asserts part of 
req.product.

PROCESS SUGGESTIONS:



Resolution: See request.product.170358
