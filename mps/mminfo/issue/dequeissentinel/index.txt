DESCRIPTION:

In deque.h:
 *  DequeIsSentinel returns TRUE iff a node is the sentinel node of the
 *  deque.
extern Bool DequeIsSentinel(Deque deque, DequeNode node);

1. No implementation of this exists in impl.std.src.c.deque

2. Logically the name should be DequeNodeIsSentinel

3. If we want this function then we should use it.  Again from deque.h:
 *  This is the recommended way to iterate over a deque:
 *
 *    node = DequeFirst(deque);
 *    while(node != DequeSentinel(deque)) {
 *      DequeNode next = DequeNodeNext(node);
 *      your code here
 *      node = next;
 *    }
 * 
  if we have this function then
 *    while(node != DequeSentinel(deque)) {
becomes
 *    while(!DequeIsSentinel(deque, node)) {


ROOT CAUSE:



SUGGESTIONS:

- Delete the prototype.
- Rename the function as in 2. and change code to use it as in 3.
