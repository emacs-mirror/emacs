DESCRIPTION:

When we have any sort of error we just bomb out and pass it back to the 
client.  We're supposed to be a memory manager, and should do better when there 
is a problem with memory.

The generic collect function does not recover from errors.
Scan and Fix can have errors.  It does not recover from these.

ROOT CAUSE:



SUGGESTIONS:

Perhaps this is an issue for the "global strategy" -- it should know what to do 
to make memory available for a necessary operation.

AMC could stop forwarding pages when it fails to allocate them.

PROCESS SUGGESTIONS:



Resolution: See request.mps.170349
