DESCRIPTION:

In the MPS we deal both with managed addresses (Addr) and unmanaged adresses 
(void *).  We map between them by casts.  This isn't very clean and could trip 
us up one day.

ROOT CAUSE:



SUGGESTIONS:

We could provide conversion macros.  This would at least let us track where the 
conversions occur.

PROCESS SUGGESTIONS:



Resolution: See request.mps.170344
