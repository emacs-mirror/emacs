DESCRIPTION:

When creating dependency files (.d), if the command is interrupted then (often) 
a zero sized file is left behind.  This causes the makefile to use incorrect 
dependencies resulting in objects being built inconsistently and incorrectly.

ROOT CAUSE:



SUGGESTIONS:

create the file with a different name and then 'mv' it

PROCESS SUGGESTIONS:



Resolution: See request.mps.170357
