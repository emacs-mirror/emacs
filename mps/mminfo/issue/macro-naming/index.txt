DESCRIPTION:

We have many macros that break naming conventions, especially by being all 
upper case when they have no special macroid behaviour (see 
guide.impl.c.naming.macro.*).  The example found here is ARCH_ALIGN which is a 
constant.  There are two many instances/uses to fix in the context of a 
review.  There are also problems with enum constants, such as Res* in 
impl.h.misc.
