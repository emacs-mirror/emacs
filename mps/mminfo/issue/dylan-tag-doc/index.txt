DESCRIPTION:

DylanWorks doesn't currently (1995-08) separate pointers, integers, and chars, 
so a fixable slot may contain any of these.  However, integers and chars are 
tagged 0b01 and 0b10 respectively, so we can ignore them.  Items tagged 0b00 
must be valid references.

1. We don't have a definition of valid references (issue.reference).
2. We haven't documented the tagging conventions.

ROOT CAUSE:



SUGGESTIONS:

1. Check the current tagging situtation with the Dylan group.
2. Update the container doc.
3. Get doc approved by Dylan group.
