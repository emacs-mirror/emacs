Discovery process: looking at Dylan implementation with Nosa and worrying about it
Locaction: dylan interface


DESCRIPTION:

If DylanWorks doesn't fill in an object properly we aren't likely to detect 
it.  We check the wrapper, but not the validity of the object contents.

ROOT CAUSE:



SUGGESTIONS:

Splat memory to some recognizable illegal value on reserve, then check the 
container contents on commit.
This is tied up with the lack of definition of what a reference is (see 
issue.reference).

PROCESS SUGGESTIONS:



Resolution: See request.dylan.170329
