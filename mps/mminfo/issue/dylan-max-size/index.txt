DESCRIPTION:

We have a made-up figure for the size of the Arena, and for other limitations.

Underspecified requirements due to lack of maturity in requirements analysis 
process and lack of requirements in Dylan project.

SUGGESTIONS:

We need to ask the Dylan team to define the maximum sizes of objects they want 
us to manage.
