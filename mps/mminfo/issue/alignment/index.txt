DESCRIPTION:

We have various alignment parameters scattered throughout the system, with no 
really good idea of what they mean or how they interact.  For example, should 
68000 default alignment really be 8?

ROOT CAUSE:

Lack of design.

SUGGESTIONS:

richard: Need to schedule a task to give this some thought and produce a 
design/policy document for alignments.  Changes to the code should follow.

PROCESS SUGGESTIONS:

Write designs and review them before implementation.

Resolution: See request.mps.170328
