DESCRIPTION:

rule.universal.readership requires that the intended readership of our MPS 
source code be clear to anyone.  We have three sorts of code, with three 
intended readerships:
  .int: Internal MPS code, the default readership is any MM developer.
  .ext: External interface headers, the default readership is any competent 
[C?] programmer.
  .glue: Glue code for EP-Core [others?], the default readership is any MM or 
EP developer.

ROOT CAUSE:



SUGGESTIONS:

.explicit: Mark all source files with an explicit readership.

.implicit: Document the implicit readerships of all source code and how to 
determine the category of given code.

.medium: Mark .glue and .ext explicitly and leave .int implicit.

PROCESS SUGGESTIONS:



Resolution: See request.mps.170345
