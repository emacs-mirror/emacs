DESCRIPTION:

Our code is not as repeatable as it could be which may cause problems in 
tracking down bugs.  Not being able to repeat our behaviour means that a 
problem may occur but the information to isolate the cause may be lost and 
unreproducible.

1. Signatures are only included in debug version of code.  [This also means we 
cannot link debug and release code.]  This means debug and release code have 
quite different behaviour, in particular they allocate different amounts of 
memory for structures.

2. Working with threads will make repeatability difficult also.

3. It is hard to be repeatable if our clients do not behave repeatably.


ROOT CAUSE:



SUGGESTIONS:

Possibly compile sigs into release code, or produce debugging versions w/o sigs.
Event logging and backtrace to capture as much information as possible when a 
problem occurs.


PROCESS SUGGESTIONS:



Resolution: See request.mps.170374
