DESCRIPTION:

There are 7 or 8 uses of Ring's in the MPS, and 6 of them (Space/Pool, 
Pool/Buffer, Space/Format, Space/Thread, Space/Root, global/Space) also use 
serials.  The serials currently break modularity, and duplicate code.  An 
initialisation bug in serials was recently found.

ROOT CAUSE:



SUGGESTIONS:

We could have a SerialRing which held a Serial and a Ring and whose Init and 
Append methods did the appropriate thing.  The master serial could be held in a 
ring member distinguished by the client, or could have extra encoding.

PROCESS SUGGESTIONS:



Resolution: See request.mps.170354
