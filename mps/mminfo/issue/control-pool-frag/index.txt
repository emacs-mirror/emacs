DESCRIPTION:

ptw: Should Trace's be manged as a resource (i.e., kept on a free list and 
recycled, rather than potentially fragmenting the control pool).  This may 
actually be a general design problem.  I worry that our free use of the control 
pool will lead to fragmentation and that we should have a layer ontop of that 
that manages particular object classes with some hysteresis.
