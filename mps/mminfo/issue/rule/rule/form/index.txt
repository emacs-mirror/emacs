DESCRIPTION:

There should be a rule which says what the form of a rule is, i.e. how the rule 
is stated.

ROOT CAUSE:

Inexperience.

SUGGESTIONS:

Specify it, but don't be too restrictive.  I believe rules can be discursive, 
but checklists derived from them must be concise in order to expedite review.

PROCESS SUGGESTIONS:

All document types should have rules which state the form of the documents of 
that type.
This rule should be added to rule.type!
