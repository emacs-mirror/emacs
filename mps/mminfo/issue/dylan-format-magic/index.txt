DESCRIPTION:

Containers are constructed in the code directly, using the numbers defined in 
design.dylan.container.  These should be lifted out and given symbolic names.  
At the moment, they violate guide.impl.c.

ROOT CAUSE:



SUGGESTIONS:

richard: Create a header file which defines symbolic names for the magic 
numbers, and use this throughout the code.

PROCESS SUGGESTIONS:



Resolution: See request.dylan.170338
