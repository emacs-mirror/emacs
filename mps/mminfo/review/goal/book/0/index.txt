1. PTW - M rule.goal refers to "the parties involved"; I can't find who they 
are.  Whose goals are these?
2. AndrewS - M Have we made it explicit that we're trying to improve the image 
of memory management.
3. GavinM - M What about making the superiority of our MM Product clearer?
4. AndrewS - M Did we ever accept that we should add Common Lisp and SML to the 
list of languages?
5. DRJ - M From Sonya's mail.skeene.1997-03-21.15-56 the following two things 
might be goals:
  .readership: Obtain as many readers as possible
  .educate: Share our knowledeg techniques and ways of doing things
6. AndrewS H m The majority of document in database have definite article in 
title
7. NickB H mN Consistency: Goal documents and other have title in all upper 
case.
8. NickB .intro m line break confusion
9. DRJ .source m Should mention mm-book discussion
10. AndrewS .source m Should mention all sources
11. AndrewS GOALS m Remove comment and put in .source
12. PTW .image m .market and .revenue are subgoals of this
13. NickB .image M goal.general.image doesn't say "to attract business", but 
"to enhance Harlequin's image as MM experts".  We're falling into the trap of 
being too general.
14. DRJ .mm M Unclear: I couldn't work out what was intended
15. PTW .mm m Is it intended to be a part of the MM product?
16. AndrewS .mm m There is possibly a reason to add tags from goal.general as 
justification, e.g. goal.general.central for collaboration with Product 
documentation, goal.general.quality, goal.general.revenue
17. DRJ .mm mN It's suggesting solutions -- uses "by"
18. PTW .mm m Is it intended to be a part of any of these products or simply to 
enhance their image?
19. AndrewS .mm m Should we make it explicit that we enhance the languages that 
Harlequin supports
20. NickB .mm m Two spaces after "ML"
21. GavinM .mm q How does this relate to .image and .market?
22. GavinM .mm q What about PostScript?
23. GavinM .mm q How flexible is this to new languages Harlequin might support, 
e.g. Java?
24. PTW .mm,.lang m These are related sub-goals, ought to be under a single 
more general goal
25. NickB .andrews.* m Consistency: Don't begin with "To"
26. PTW .andrews.*,.ptw.* m Are these relevant?
27. AndrewS .andrews.* m I'm not happy with the wording, although the core 
intent expressed is satisfactory.
28. NickB .andrews.publish m Has solution, "through"
29. DRJ - I process: I can't tell what goals should be here and should not; 
perhaps this is becauase you just can't do that with goals
30. AndrewS - I roles, could add example scenarios, and how you might react
31. NickB - I guide.tag, tags inside this are confusing
32. NickB - I project.book.req: This refers to a document that doesn't yet exist
33. DRJ - I We need a place that dicusses the reletive importance of the goals 
and the trade-offs.



Brainstorm start: 14:55
Brainstorm end: 15:52
Brainstorm length: 47


BRAINSTORM:

1. PTW: Goals need to identify who the parties are, like a contract with EP or 
Dylan.
GavinM: Rule about goal sets or in a guide to writing them?  rule.goal.identify
PTW: One of the reasons we have this issue is because of the way the book 
project came about.  It's a solution looking for a problem.  In the other cases 
we've had customer's approach us.  The closest we have here to a customer is 
Sonya's announcement that Jo wants more books.

2. NickB: Missing goal
AndrewS: .mm goal talks only about MM product, only other mention is in .market
NickB: Analogous to .lang
DRJ: I couldn't tell what should be there and what shouldn't.
NickB: What's happenned is that we've had meetings, and it's hard to be sure 
that you're complete.
DRJ: Richard said that, if we ever take any action, then it must be specified 
as a goal.

3. GavinM: Informed basis for choice
PTW: Complete oversight.  It's been discussed, in market analysis stuff.  
Written in a mail that wasn't logged.
GavinM: Perhaps all mail should be logged, on mm-book.
NickB: Outside people don't copy lists.
DRJ: Managers seem to have a fear of things being archived.

4. DRJ: Incompleteness again.
GavinM: Or over-specificity.
PTW: Raise while Andrew was on vacation.
AndrewS: Dave Berry reviewed the prospectus and said we should include all the 
languages Harlequin supports.
PTW: Gavin's comment about generalising it too all present and future Harlequin 
products.
NickB: Is this about improving Harlequin sales, or encouraging people to use 
better languages.
PTW: .market says "make world better place for GC languages"
AndrewS: Perhaps I should have mentioned the issue explicitly in my RFC.
GavinM: What was special about it?
AndrewS: I had doubts about it and I didn't express them.  It happenned when I 
went on holiday.
GavinM: What about issue tracking; flaw in RFCs
NickB: Flaw in whole review that writing goals is hard and anyone writing a 
goal set is going to make mistakes.  Part of the solution is the email 
discussions is part is fixed by reviewing document.  
GavinM: We shouldn't be using review to do this.
NickB: Have more meetings when writing goal documents.
GavinM: We we supporting Andrew enough?
AndrewS: I don't feel I'm really the author.  I didn't come up with the goals 
by myself.  I didn't know how responsible I was for coming up with the goals.  
PTW: Again customer not clear.
NickB: goal.epcore has six goals that came from EP.  Then we had an MM goal.  
Then there's a Harlequin one.
AndrewS: LFCS goals include personal goals
NickB: Suggest when writing new document, if unclear about construction, 
consult any similar document which has passed review for comparison and 
guidance.  
GavinM: Andrew, was your communication with MM group poor?
AndrewS: Should be more guidance in writing goal documents.

5. PTW: We didn't identify customer
GavinM: Identify customers in goal documents.
NickB: What are customers?
PTW: Person driving goal.

13. NickB: Richard said we should be more general.  It'd not clear that this 
goal is too general, but tag and reference are undeserved.
Tags in goal documents are important.
AndrewS: Isn't there a precedent for requirements that tags are derived from 
goals.
NickB: This one is failing to be mnemonic.  Goal tags are important.
GavinM: Additional rule

14. DRJ: Related to "is this going with the product?".  Someone had a good 
idea, viz. let's ship the book with the product, and then drived a goal.
PTW: Tucker tried to justify working on the book.
NickB: "enhance"
GavinM: We're allowed words like this in goals.
PTW: Two parts of this goal: promote mm and go with product.
NickB: Three scenarios: buy book then product, buy book then product much 
later, bundle book with product.
GavinM: How about: To produce a book which, if bundled, would enhance the 
product.
PTW: Could be generalised for all Harlequin products.
NickB: PS is different.
PTW: I found Web pages about writing PS for good GC.
NickB: The author of this goal might think it is clear.  Need copy editing or 
brainstorm meetings.

NickB: It's a good document.
DRJ: I thought so too.
AndrewS: Gavin did warn me.

DRJ: The number of pieces of paper has improved slightly.
NickB: It worked for me.  I wouldn't mind having my source documents 2-up 
duplex.
DRJ: I agree.  Simplex is only necessary for the target document.

AndrewS: As a first-time reviewer, I was seduced by the fact that I was going 
to come and have everything put in front of me, then I found I didn't remember 
everything.  
GavinM: With hindsight I'd have given you process.review.ref.
AndrewS: First-time reviewer should be reminded to look at Spring documents 
again in advance.
