ISSUES:

DRJ: 1m
NickB: 1m
PTW: 2M 1m
GavinM: 1m 1q

PTW:
1. - M Inconsistency with meeting.epcore.1995-09-13; no reliability goal
2. - M Do these goals reflect the ordering of meeting.epcore.1995-09-13
3. .compete m This is not clear to me

DRJ: 
4. .compete m Need "in ScriptWorks"

NickB:
5. .improve m General MM system should be clarified or rephrased

GavinM:
6. .relate m rule.universal.element
7. .downsize-.improve q Should we have goals that talk vaguely of assisting and 
changing without targets?

BRAINSTORM:

1. Oversight.  Not much impact in practice.  Trans?  Is reliability a 
requirement?  Take more care with important documents.  These documents were 
discussed with client managers in meeting that should have been reviews, but 
their defects weren't dealt with properly.  Process works, but didn't review it 
soon enough.  Process is perfect beyond improvement.

2. Ordering is implicit in requirement levels.  How do you derive requirements 
from goals?  Use the meetings to derive the reqirements.  Having an ordering on 
the goals would be useful.  Or classify as requirements?  Shouldn't drop the 
client's requirements on th floor, but it's not clear how goal priorities fit 
into goal structure.  

Mail messages are becoming more and more helpful.  Would be helpful to have one 
document.  Happy with doling roles out.  Problem with printing all documents 
out.

Time OK.

Checklists.  How about printing checklists 2 UP.  Checkers handbook.


Number of major issues: 2
Number of minor issues: 4
Number of issues: 7
Major defects remaining: 2

Edit manpower: 1.5


Edit notes:

1. Reliability is not a goal of the project. It is a requirement on the project 
(see req.epcore.attr.rel). Improving the reliability of ScriptWorks is not a 
goal, because ScriptWorks is already very reliable. "To not decrease the 
reliability of ScriptWorks" is not a good goal, because negative goals are no 
goals at all (they can be met by doing nothing, and are not motivations for a 
project). So I'm not doing anything about this issue.

2. Our process has not in the past accounted for ordering of goals. We have 
priority in requirements. I have restructured the document to show motivation 
and ordering of goals.

3. clarified (added "in ScriptWorks").
4. added.
5. rephrased.
6. removed "communication" as it is redundant.
7. Answered in mail.nickb.1996-09-19.16-17.

Approval received from dtb (mail.dtb.1996-10-23.18-10).

Exit manpower: 0.25


Exit notes:

Estimate of remaining major defects equals major defects per page. Manpower 
saved estimated as 10% risk of 300 hour cost (geometric mean of 100 and 1000) 
due to mistaken priorities of goals and lack of knowledge of the nanoRip 
"project".


Manpowerused: 4.5
