5. 10 M This paragraphs is over-technical
6. 19 M This paragraph says almost nothing
7. 32 M Should mention reachability and link to it
8. 44 M Should explcitly mention bigsurv and allocsrv
9. F M No navigation bar at bottom

RIT:
10. H M Can't tell what this document is, what the navbar applies to, that 
there are two other documents
11. 18 M I don't understand this at all; what sorts of assumptions are these?  
Should have example.

26. 8 m First sentence is clumsy.  Second "from" is unclear.
27. 22 m e/it is/it can be/ to destress advantage
28. 23 m This is silly
29. 24 m Deemphasise advantage
30. 24 m I'm not sure this is true
31. 29 m Should add that sub-allocators may be less efficient and less reliable 
if not written by an expert

RIT:
32. 3 m For some reason I found it confusing that os and app were singular
33. 5 m "reused for" -> "reused by"?

36. 10 m I don't understand the indentation on this paragraph

allocation in turn
39. 30 m a/implementation/s/
40. 42 m Does BASIC mainly use AMM?
41. 42 m Why not just PostScript

NickB:
42. 8 mN Not about receiving, but about satisfying
43. 9 m I don't think we need to talk about "smart enough"
44. 10 m "dynamically" is redundant
45. 10 m Parenthetical notes appear to be defining, and first is incorrect

53. 32 m Second sentence is ugly
54. 37 m e/typically/often
55. 42 m Would omit "although ... requirement"; not true that it's rare

GavinM:
56. 4 I Glossary entry for SIMM
57. 7 m This is clumsy
58. 8 m Should mention "allocator"
59. 12-19 m Poorly organised
60. 12 m a/so/that/
61. b16 m Should mention the effect on interface complexity here
62. 20 m heap/malloc/free/C/stack could be linked to the Glossary

64. 29 IN Should have glossary entry for sub-allocator
65. 30 m C++ before COBOL

NickB;
66. 30 Nm Should add a couple more languages such as Fortran

BRAINSTORM:

NAV: Restructuring late at night.  New process, and new type of document.  
Should have guide.html.external.  Ought to write down my personal rules.  
Trying to simplify structure.  This will resolve itself as we develop a process 
for writing articles like this.  How did the division occur?  Could we decide 
the chunking before the writing?  Probably not, because we don't know how much 
we'll write.  

FALSE: Tried to avoid defining "root set".  Could talk about "program 
variables".  Need to be written by someone who's an expert/familiar with subtle 
aspects.  Should have input with by education or existing expert.

MISSING: Same problem.

Logging: Hard to justify time spent.  Should experiment with logging reports.  
Not in a position to measure.  New defects.  Generally about 5%.  Could save 3 
man-hours.
