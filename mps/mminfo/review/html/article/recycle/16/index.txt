ISSUES:

DRJ: 5M 6m 12mins
NickB: 3M 2m 12mins
RIT: 1M 5m 11mins
LMB: 14m 16mins
GavinM: 10m 9mins

DRJ:
1. 11 M second clause is not true
2. 27 M Should add after 1sent that this is known as "incr coll" or otherwise 
define it
3. 42 M "don't win in performance" is hackish terminology
4. 43 M "ref ... situations" is also ht
5. a43 M Document ends with no navigation; should be mroe friendly

NickB:
6. 8 M "root set" is not another name for the program data
7. 13 M I flatly disagree with the last clause
8. - M This document should define colector/collection probably in first 
paragraph

RIT:
9. 30-34 M This gave me the impression that this was all I needed to know, and 
didn't mention that I need to know the size of an object, or where objects start

DRJ:
10. 9 m last sentence: I bet this is false
11. 26 m last sentence: The criticism is not undue if the GC is obtrusive
12. 26 Nm What is the subject of undue criticism?
13. 30 M This is not the only motivation behind cons GC: portability and 
flexibility
14. 38 m Needs a diagram
15. 39 m Comment in brackets, should explain why, mention synchonization
16. 40 I disadv of MMM corresponding drawback; memory overhead on every object

NickB: 
17. - m This is the weakest of these three sections
18. 8-25 C Need to split off tracing from reference counting
19. 15-25 m Need to say about time being proportional to live data
20. 35-43 m Some of these points might be well presented as lists of advs and 
disadvs

RIT:
21. 1 m 1sent talks of "an", second uses "they"; suggets change first to plural
22. 18 m e/adjusts/adjust/
23. 27 m Seemed odd to define "mutator" for this little section; would be 
better integrated if tracer, etc, were defined
24. 42 m "but ... performers" should be collectors
25. 41 C SHould one bit be hyphenated?

LMB:
26. 6 m e/Counts/counts/
27. 8 m 1sent; rewrite to avoid "to to"
28. 8 m Should put mark immediately after flag
29. 8 m 2last send e/which/that/
30. 13 m "are some refinement ... technique" could be worded better
31. 16-17 m Link "locality of reference" and external fragmentation"
32. 19 m Don't list any possible combinations
33. 27 m Link mutator
34. 28 m Extra space before full stop
35. 33 m e/lots/a lot of/
36. 35 m Link object and reference
37. 39 m e/an/a/

GavinM:
38. 16 m Should link memory cache and virtual memory
39. 33 m w/to/that/
40. 40 m clumsy
41. 41 m Should explain the other transitions
42. 42 m "collections" should mention combinations

NickB:
43. 13 Nm Number: Most algorithms, some refinement
44. 41 Nm This omits to say that the reason why one-bit is a good idea is that 
you can keep them in the pointer, could say "such a flag on a pointer means it 
is unique"

LMB:
45. Overview NI Shoudl link recycling under recycling para

GavinM:
46. H Nm Should say that it's automatic recycling
