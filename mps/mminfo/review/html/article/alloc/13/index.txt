GavinM: 9m 6mins
NickB: 3m 6mins

DRJ:
1. 11 m Should add that this reduces fragmentation according to Wilson
2. 12 m The words "roving pointer" belong in here
3. 14 m This is in desparate need of a diagram
4. 17 m Should add that typically the rounding leads to a significant amount of 
wasted memory
5. 20 m Last sentence, last clause, not sure it's true or what point is being 
made

RIT: 
6. 13 m e/the/a
7. 19,20 m Is pool a standard term

LMB:
8. 7 m 2sent, last clause, comma should be a semi-colon or em-dash
9. 8-11 m Don't know if you want more vertical space
10. * m Still not clear what the difference between Buddy and FSP is
11. 10 m "fast at adding"
12. 12 m Last sentence -- why not
13. 20 m "actual" redundant

NickB:
14. 7 Nm e/should be/is/
15. 8 m Last sentence could be rephrased "This generates lots of unusably small 
remainders"
16. 11 m Mention good locality
17. 12 Nm Last sentence isn't stricly true; needs rephrasing

GavinM:
18. 1 m a/memory/from the OS/
19. 8 m "split remainders" is unclear
20. 10 m Should explain locality of reference here
21. 12 m Clarify "size ordering"
22. 13 m a/Fibonacci sequence/(see below for example)
23. 15 m "returned" sounds clumsy here
24. 16 m last senetence, shoudl explain Fibonacci property
25. 16 mN Should mention internal fragmentation
26. 19 m b/fragmentation/external/ and linked

DRJ:
27. 10 Nm Should add that this can lead to bad fragmentation

RIT:
28. 10 mN Title of paragraph doesn't make it clear whether list is reversed or 
not
