Was this review worthwhile? Our estimate of manpower saved suggests not, 
because it is based solely on the major defects. We have, however, gained the 
following in exchange for 2 man-hours work:

- confidence in this key document.
- more experience reviewing documents like this one (e.g. short documents, 
project documents).
- knowledge of how to do DocLinks in Notes (nickb only).
- a decrement in the number of un-reviewed documents
