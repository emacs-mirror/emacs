Brainstorm length: 29 minutes


BRAINSTORM:

1. NickB: Bunch of defects that relate to purpose and readership.  E.g. 
duplication.  
GavinM: EPCORE can understand this, but not all of MM can.  But it's a summary 
of stuff in req.epcore.fun. Also, tags broadly inconsistent with specific 
documents.
NickB: It was believed that it had to stand alone.
GavinM: Breaks tagging principle of saying things once.  Also underlinked.  
Overview doesn't come from anywhere, define anything, or go anywhere.
NickB: Should be more like .over.attr.  Overview appeared in .hist.4.  It's an 
executive summary.  
GavinM: Overview should have separate readership and purpose.

2. NickB: Another overview problem.  Need to keep executive summary up to date 
with rest.  Need tags in both directions.

3. GavinM: Suggest form button shortcut to increment version and add history 
comment
NickB: Why are dates important
GavinM: To make it easier to check what meetings were included, to examine 
second differentials of edit.
NickB: What are requirements of history?

4. GavinM: In changing 4.1, EP didn't change MM-EPCORE requirments.
NickB: EP have a strong convention to avoid this problem; we didn't bother 
using it.

-. GavinM: This document has not counter-requirements.
NickB: req.epcore.plan.int  covers this.  Our CounterReq terminology is 
immature; cf req.dylan.
GavinM: CounterReqs and AntiReqs should be part of req procedure.

-. NickB: Documents should be single-sided
GavinM: I told Notes to do the Product Documents single-sided; it disobeyed me.

-. DRJ: We all forgot our roles.  Hard to concentrate on more than role.
GavinM: Could select N most relevant checklists
DRJ: Could increase number of participants.
GavinM: Could reduce checking rate
NickB: Eight roles, eight people, 8 lines/minute, review proceeds at 1 line per 
reviewer-minute.  More checkers would increase costs to about 1 pound/line.
GavinM: Shortenend checklists and added subsections.
