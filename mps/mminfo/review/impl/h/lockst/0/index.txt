1. drj, 15, q, Does it really need to include "std.h"?  Do other similar ones?
2. richard, 9, m, Could mention that this selects header according to OS.

Edit (dsm, 1995-10-18)

1. Answer: It doesn't need to include "std.h" to work.  But our policy is to 
include "std.h" in all source files.
2. Comment added as suggested.
