ISSUES:

NickB: 2M Design (design.mps.exec-env), Cons (standard.ansic)
PTW: Didn't start
GavinM: 1q 1I 

NickB: 
1. 6-7 M Should refer client developers to some documentation
2. 13-15 M These unnecessary includes may break in a free-standing 
implementation [Won't break, ANSI 7.1.6 stddef]

GavinM:
3. 13-15 q Why are these needed
4. - I "Library" and "Interface" are bad names for the upward and downward 
interfaces to the MPS library.

BRAINSTORM:

2. Looks as thought Richard went though several iterations.  This set is the 
allowed set (except float.h).  Should avoid .h files that include .h files.
