Loggin Start: 16:55 Finish 17:03, Major 2, Minor 7, questions 2, unknown 5

1. drj, 7, M, no doc
2. drj, 12, m, #include "std.h" should come before ADTs (guide.impl.c.adt)
3. drj, 14, M, size_t is a really bad idea
4. drj, 21, m, don't need root.h
5. drj, 94, m, th should be the
6. drj, 96, q, is this really right for the marked set?  surely it shoudl say 
"assumed or proved to be alive"?
7. drj, 113, m, The semantics of TraceCondemn are unclear.  In particular what 
the refsig parm is for.
8. drj, 121, q, Presumably this will have a different interface when we go 
incremental?
9. drj, 134, m, you're right.
10. dsm, 8, m, lack of comments.
11. dsm, 134, m, "Need explanation" needs explanation.
12. ptw, 67, ?, Should Trace's be manged as a resource (i.e., kept on a free 
list and recycled, rather than potentially fragmenting the control pool).  This 
may actually be a general design problem.  I worry that our free use of the 
control pool will lead to fragmentation and that we should have a layer on top 
of that that manages particular object classes with some hysteresis.
13. ptw, 92, ?, "trying to kill" -> "will potentially recycle"
14. ptw, 96-103, ?,  white/gray/black  Should these terms be explained or at 
least an explanatory document referenced?
15. ptw, 109, ?, reference rank.  Define or document.
16. ptw, 121, ?, Note phase limitation -- not incremental.  Should any thought 
be given to whether incremental is an easy extension to this?

Edit (dsm, 1995-10-27)

1. Some comments added.
2. include moved.
3. Changed to unsigned int.
4. include deleted.
5. s/th/the
6. Depends on how you define alive.  I think the suggested change is just as 
confusing
7. I have modified the comment slightly.
8. Yes, this has not been designed yet.
9. Replaced with some comments
10. Added some comments
11. see 9.
12. Don't know.  Raised issue.control-pool-frag.
13. Comment changed as suggested
14. Yes.  But no action taken
15. I will documented this in ref.h.  See idea.rank for now.
16. Noted in comments.  It has.  The work TraceRun does, could be done 
piecewise.
