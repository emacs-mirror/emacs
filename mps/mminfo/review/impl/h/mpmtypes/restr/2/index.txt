mpmtypes.h(MMdevel_restr.2)
  dsm
    Where does MPS_T_WORD come from?  Reference?
    Is AddrStruct * compatible with void *?  We have an assumption here.
    There are tabs in the file.
    Enums are guaranteed to go up from zero.
    Link types to their documentation (or at least implementation).
  drj
    ApStruct / LDStruct inconsistent naming (uppercasing).
    Sort out types for TraceSet / TraceId.
    Inconsistent use of "unsigned int" and "unsigned".
    ProtMode is really an AccessMode.

    Could do with more explanation in the leader comment.
    Group types into some groups with a bit of documentation, esp.
      Word, Bytes, Addr, etc.
    Incomplete types should reference their structures and/or impl.
    Rank should be unsigned.
    PoolMethodX is inconsistent with BufferXMethod.
    PoolMethodScan has parameter at the end.
    RingNone is unused.  Use it or remove it.  Use a magic value?
    TraceIdNone will become deprecated.
    Rank enum could do with a tag linking to rank.
    Rank enum should be linked to mps.h (or commented) it must be in sync.
    Root enum could be linked to the root structure.

Edit (richard)

1. Corrected "Ap" to "AP" everywhere.
2. Added documentation to Word, Byte, Addr, etc.
3. Changed Rank to unsigned.
4. Changed PoolMethodX to PoolXMethod everywhere.
5. Changed TraceId and TraceSet to unsigned, and added range checks at 
impl.c.mpm.check.ti and impl.c.mpm.check.ts.
6. Added tag to RootVar enum pointing to RootStruct declaration.
7. Added references from incomplete types to implementations.
8. Changed ProtMode to AccessSet, ProtNONE to AccessSetEMPTY, Prot(READ|WRITE) 
to Access(READ|WRITE) everywhere.
9. Changed RingNone to RingNONE, TraceIdNone to TraceIdNONE, TraceSetEmpty to 
TraceSetEMPTY.
