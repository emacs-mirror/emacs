1. 9-13 M If this description is accurate, it isn't consistent with MM's end 
goals
2. 7 m Copyright out of date
3. 21 m note 2
4. 15-27 I Do we have a standard format for documenting Pool interfaces

DRJ: 
5. 9-11 m Some of this is design and should not be menioned here

NickB:
6. 7 m What is the readership; is it intended for clients?
7. 9-27 m Should have pointer to design/should be in design doc
8. 9-27 m Should have pointer to client doc/should be in client doc
9. 19 q When is this default defaulted to
10. 25 m e/with/wish/
11. 40 m Redundant parenthesis on MFSPool
12. 39,40 m These parameters should be unnamed

GavinM:

BRAINSTORM:

1. Could do better.  Thought end goal was to not have such restrictions.  
extendBy not required to be multiple of unitSize.  Oversight.  Education?  Not 
a client pool.  Need adequate documentation.
