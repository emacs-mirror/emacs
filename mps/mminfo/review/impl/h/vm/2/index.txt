1. m, drj, 1, New leader comment convention.  This needs documenting (or in 
fact, deciding).
2. m, richard, 1, Do we include the status in the document itself?
3. m, drj, 9, Comment doesn't make it clear that you reserve one area then map 
in subranges.
4. m, drj, 52, VMIsValid is in a funny place, tucked under the "Reserve Address 
Space" comment.
5. m, drj, 32, VMGrain is non-negative, otherwise a grain of 1 is impossible.
6. m, drj, 68, Specify what happens when you map mapped pages or unmap unmapped 
pages, or overlap, or whatever.
7. m, dsm, 50, No indication of what resources are consumed or what the failure 
conditions are.
8. m, dsm, 50, No documentation of limitations on reserving or mapping memory.
9. M, richard, 7, List source documents, including the design placeholder.
10. m, richard, 9, Need a diagram showing reserved space and mapped areas 
somewhere, perhaps in the design.
11. q, drj, 51, VMDestroy is not symmetrical -- should it unmap everything 
implicitly?
12. m, richard, 22, Missing documentation conventions for abstract types: 
incomplete pointers to structures, etc.
13. m, richard, 33, "address range units" is unclear.  This is the alignment of 
requests.
14. M, richard, 41, Failure codes and their meanings are not documented.
15. m, richard, 46, Explanation of VMDestroy is backwards.
16. M, richard, 68, Should explain that you can only map things in the reserved 
area.
17. M, richard, 72, Unmap doesn't explain how it interacts with map -- 
overlaps, etc?
18. m, richard, 72, Should document the limitations of mapping.
19. m, richard, 72, Should document the resource consumption is -- what are 
consequences.
20. M, richard, 68, Document failure conditions, codes, and meanings.
21. m, richard, 1, No mention of cost of doing anything.
