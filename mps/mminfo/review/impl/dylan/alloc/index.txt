Look at results of two-phase allocation implementation.

Who    Location        Type    Description
r      dw.c:leader     m       New header format to conform to guide.text?
r      ?               M       Wrappers managed in separate pool?
dsm    dw.c:CARDSIZE   m       Magic numbers?
dsm    dw.c            M       Limitations must be explicit.  Missing 
requirements?
                               Size of object maximum?  Needs to be defined.
dsm    mm.h:MMError    m       Need better documentation of error codes.
r      mm.h:Note.1     m       This note should be an issue and be planned for.
r      mm.h:leader     m       New header format to conform to guide.text?
drj    mm.h            m       Nothing is said about thread or interrupt safety.
r      alloc design    m       Allocation error handlers useful elsewhere.
dsm    ?               M       Need to doc assumptions about "unsigned" etc.
r      doc             M       Document location dependency interface
r      req             m       MTBF requirement for DylanWorks?
dsm    req             m       Integrity against attack requirement?
r      mm.h            m       Document purpose: changing interfaces, safety, 
etc.
drj    mm.h:roots      m       Mis-documentation of what is a reference
drj    mm.h:roots      m       Shared roots betweem MMs should be valid
r      doc             m       What is a valid reference?
r      tests           M       Need better tests
dsm    ?               m       Need random failure to test clients
r      buildsys        m       More varieties of allocation needed
drj    contiainer      Q       Do we fix the user word in the wrapper?
r      format.h        m       IsNot -> Maybe
dsm    dw.c            m       Static data -- this is an exception?  Why?  
Policy?
r      pervasive       m       Set of properties of implements: static, thread, 
re-entrant, etc.
dsm    "               m       Add this to the limitations exported from the 
module.
