Brainstorm start: 15:23


BRAINSTORM:

1. Many parts are unclear, misleading, inaccurate, or untrue.
Not everyone has seen everything.  gavin didn't mail all his entries round.  
PTW suggests a documentation person to work with GavinM.  Feels like a document 
with several authors.  PTW suggests drafts and review deadlines.  Important to 
distinguish technical and doc review roles.  A single source would be nice.  
Need more design and requirements.

Stages: Content/Proof-reading; legal; visual design.

Richard: The intended readership has a major effect on design.

Print and bind?

2. Legal issues
Can't summarise trademarks.  DRJ: Different sort of file, contributor, user 
from normal review documents.

3. Links:
Bib refs should be title.  Not unhelpful, but inconsistent.
definition, synonyms, & antonyms; detail; memory management relevance; 
historical; see also other entries & bib, etc.

4. Criteria unclear:
Define them and employ them.   Need non-trivial "mm-relation" paragraph.    
Don't need entry for every term used.

5. Style, terminology, relationships:
Write down what we've learnt.  Documentor help?  Leah?

6. Format and criteria quoting and citing:
Bibbing everything devalues the bibliography.  Split bibliography.  

7. Emphasise MM

Documents not tagged clearly.  

Proofing issue; should have been proofed before internal review.  All this 
information must go to marketing.  

Should have made it clearer that web browsers should have been used.

Is this the appropriate time for the review?  How about after second proof?
