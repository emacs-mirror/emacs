ISSUES:

DRJ:
1. scan M This definition is more like "tracing"
2. scavenge m Also has use synonymous with GC
3. stack M This is incomplete?
4. static m Horrible explorer bug; fixed in 3.0
5. strong M Independent of roots; property of references
6. sub-graph m Link to graph, edge and node, reword for non-mathmos

Richard:
7. - I Need to be consistent about term for transport/tenured/fixed
8. Scheme m Write this one
9. segmentation violation M SIGSEGV is unclear out of context; name of signal
10. " M "access not permitted"; why not?
11. " m Add type 11 error/Mac equivalent
12. Smalltalk m b/which/language/
13. " m incomplete; what relevence to mm?
14. snap-out m First clause ugly
15. " M "condemned data" is inaccurate
16. " M Whole text is unclear
17. " m Use of colour in GIF doesn;t translate well; do we care?
18. - M Check root/reference confusion everywhere
19. sub-graph q Is this correct/useful definition
20. swapped in/swapped out m Should add usually entire image
21. swapping M add reference to "virtual memory"
22. - C Kent sent some standards references; these are completely useless
23. - M Completeness unclear

AndiH:
24. - q Who's going ot be responsible for the upkeep of these pages?
25. scavenge M What?
26. snap-out m "transported to point to" is bad style
27. stack m a/Usually/the/
28. stack m e/functions/function/
29. stack m compare/cf
30. static M Static "can" refer to; either it does or it doesn't
31. static q "Can't be linked to by extern declaration elsewhere" TT
32. static m e/objects/Objects
33. static M Please finish writing this
34. strong m about "strong root"
35. strong,- m data is plural
36. sub-graph m b/G/in/

PTW:
37. scan,scavenge M Should be synonyms
38. " MN Richard calls for consistent language; self-consistent entries are of 
historical entries; archaic defintions.
39. snap-out m "borken heart" should be "forwarding pointer"
40. " m What is our name for snap-out?  Part of fix?
41. " m GIF: broken heart: referent unclear
42. " m GIF: Printed quality sucks
43. stack M This be more generally termed "LIFO storgage"
44. " M Should be an entry for "spaghetti stack"
45. " M Should be a cross-ref for "continuation" and entry
46. static M Should be "static variable", "static memory", etc.
47. " M Should be cross-ref to "extent", "scope", "lifetime" and entries
48. " m static variable should be contrasted with dynamic
49. " M static memory hardware; major distinction is that it does not require 
refresh
50. strong,- m Adjective defined as noun phrase.

NickB: 
51. SmallTalk C "standardisation" is better than "official"
52. transport I e/condemn/condemned/
53. static m "In the context.."shoudl be contrasted with manual/malloc/heap
54. sub-graph m e2/also/all/

GavinM:
55. scavenge m Should link to garbage collection
56. snap-out m Should link to collector
57. stack M Should mention operand stacks
58. static mN C-specifics should be clearer

DRJ:
59. - m "disc" is spelt inconsistently

Richard:
60. - MN e/data/object/ where appropriate
61. strong mN "assumed to be live" is false

AnsiH:
62. sub-graph Nm should read "such that all of the nodes in S are also in G and 
that all of the ..."
63. - qN Some of these defnitions are extrememly full and specific; others 
aren't.  Do we need a policy?

PTW:
64. stack MN data-stack, control-stack, stack allocation, and lexical 
variables, cactus stack
