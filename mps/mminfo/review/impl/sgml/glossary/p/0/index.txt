Richard:
9. design IN document link/anchor of glossary
10. page M inaccurate (see Richard)

link. E.g. paged in, paged out, paging
12. paged out m Strike "but must be fetched from storage"
13. Pascal m In or around; which?
14. Perl M Emphasis the contribution of automatic mm to Perl's success

27. - I Focus of glossary: Some aren't stricly MM.  E.g. Pascal
28. paged in,paged out M Are these nouns or verbs?
29. paged out m e/in/out
30. Pascal m Paragraph style is crap
31. ",- M Policy for use of brackets
32. Perl M "The object-oriented support is a light dusting of syntactic sugar": 
What does this mean?
33. - m Quotations: Should they be bibbed, attributed
34. Perl m "undef"-ing; yuck!
35. precise,- m Style: "compare with" should be "cf"
36. Prolog m Style of book title; check
37. " q "See [dec96]"; what is this

45. PostScript m document or page description
46. " m Should there more history?
47. prolog M Is GC required or not?  Why is Prolog here?
48. promote m Does promotion always involve moving?
49. tenuring I Is there a link for this?
50. Copyright MN Where there is so much information behind link, should be 
directive
51. - M Is there a way to get printed output to have header and footer; BANNER?
52. - m Shoudl this be composed in Framemaker?
53. - MN Diagrams shoudl be something other than GIFs, e.g. PostScript

NickB:

55. - I "grain size" unclear
56. - I "virtual memory" should use "page out"
57. - M "physical memory" entry
58. padding m "data-structure" should be _object_
59. " m Should "bytes" be "memory"?
60. paging m b/memory/physical/ and link
61. Pascal m "manual memory management" should be a link/ have entry
62. " m b/type system/static/
63. " M What does "official" mean.

GavinM:
64. paging m e/technique/act/
65. Pascal m Third sentence; note-style
