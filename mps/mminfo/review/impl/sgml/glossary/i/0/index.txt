ISSUES:

DRJ:
1. in-band headers m cf out-of-band
2. incremental m See also tri-colour marking
3. inverted page-table m link "paged in"
4. " m Secord-last sentence: binding of last "it" is unclear

Richard:
5. IBM 704 m == is a C-ism
6. in-band headers M Should this be just "headers"?
7. " m Frame: never heard of this one
8. incremental M unclear to readership
9. " M Emphasise advantage more clearly; use work parallel
10. inverted-page table q Is it typically hardware supported?
11. " M Move entire parenthesis to "page table"
12. - M completeness not stated

AndiH:
13. IBM704 M Extra-ordinary bad style in "Each word..."

PTW:
14. IBM704 m 2! looks like factorial
15. in-band headers m Shoudl be be a cross-reference to trailer?
16. incremental m "parallel" is a preferred synonym of "concurrent"
17. infant mortality M Complete definitions, even if repetitions
18. inverted-page table m Do we mean "big bag of pages" as opposed to BIBOP?

NickB: 
19. in-band headers m Link to tag
20. inverted-page table M Link to "virtual memory" and mention term
21. in-band headers m Shouldn't be plural

GavinM:
22. GLOSSBAR m These are very small targets
23. IBM704 m We should avoid obscure abbreviation like "ca"
24. " q Last sentence; do we mean "assembler mnemomics"?
25. in-band headers m Link "block" and "freed"
26. inverted page-table I define hash
27. " I define address space
28. " m link to has, address space, address
29. " q What does this have to do with BIBOP?

PTW (again):
30. in-band headers MN This implies that the information  is only useful for 
free

NickB (again):
31. IBM704 mN Consistency: Capitalisation of Lisp (universal?)
32. - qN Is this glossary turning into a dictionary and is this aa good thing?
