Richard: 1M 4m 3I
NickB: 3m
PTW: 1M 2m
GavinM: 1M 11m 

Richard:
1. - M Missing design, source, readship, purpose, requirements

PTW:
2. - M Justify why we discarded distinguished ring head

GavinM:
3. 131-133 M RING_FOR omits first element; this is not documented

DRJ:
4. - m Misplaced design
5. 55 C It would be sufficient here to check ring!=NULL
6. - C RingAppend/RING_FOR easy to misuse; both arguments have same type
7. 69,80,93,106,114 m Tags do not exist

Richard: 
8. - I courier font; hyphen is too small
9. - I RING_FOR not used much
10. - I RING_FOR could be safer against node changes
11. 22 m e/the/they
12. 62 m e/Ringinit/RingInit/
13. 120-122 m _type, _type, _ring inconsistent with RING_ELT

NickB: 
14. 118-144 m What is this stuff doing in this file?

PTW:
15. 50 m Full ring integrity check?
16. 126 m Justify this statement

GavinM:
17. 4 m File editted in 1996
18. 75,86,99,etc m Should be tagged
19. 131 m _var is wrong
20. 132 m Shoudl document variable should already be declared
21. 139 m FooRing breaks naming convention
22. 144 m Tag could be better

PTW: 
23. - I Should write tool to update Copyright before ship

BRAINSTORM:

2. Justified in Richard's mail.  Optimised bulk of source code by factor of 
five?  Sacrifice of debugability?  Count field missing, and 
same-type-arguments.  Should we re-introduce separate type?  Could still find 
out.  maybe.  Three flaws: change sig resemblance; offset outside object; 
broken rings.  No design doc; no consultation and no justification of change.  
Nothing to base discussion around.  Evaluation of trade-off.  Requirements on 
Ring's.  Signatures are generally indistinguishable.  Signatures could be odd.
