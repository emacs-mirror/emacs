Kickoff start: 1996-09-11 14:00 BST Byre, Longstanton (see review.impl.c.root.15)


ISSUES:

NickB: 1M, 1m, 1q Design (design.mps.exec-env), Cons (standard.ansic, 
impl.h.mpslib)
PTW: Did start it
GavinM: 1m Cons (impl.h.mpslib)

NickB: 
1. 6-22 M No indication to MPS client application developers where they might 
find documentation
2. 28 m This #include is unnecessary
3. 44,49,54,59 q These casts between FILE * and mps_lib_file * rely on 
implementation defined behaviour

GavinM:
4. 19-22 m Need action
5. - C Quite a good file really

BRAINSTORM:

1. We don't have any rules for client C.  Should be review role for client 
documents?
