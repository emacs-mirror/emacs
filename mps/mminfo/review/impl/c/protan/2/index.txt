Richard:
3. - M Missing sources, design, requirements, purposes, readership

PTW:
4. 31-37 M Undocumented dependency; needs justification

DRJ:
5. 23-24 m These declarations are not made in the minimal block
6. 32 m modularity violation seg->pm
7. 44 m Names of formal arguments to f are not necessary

Richard: 
8. 13,18 m Justify NOOP
9. 21 m Explain what this acheives
10. 43 m r_o breaks naming conventions

NickB:
11. 18 m Shoudl state UNUSED arguments
12. 24 m This variable name is unwise (notsynced)

PTW: 
13. 30-40 m Why is this not using RING_FOR?

BRAINSTORM:

1. We assume that empty bodies can get away without checking.  Also, when 
there's no obvious way of checking, we skip it.  Never let it slip.  Insert 
comment as you go past.  Polishing checklist - common things you forget to do.

3. Missing sdrpr.  See 1.

4. All a bit subtle; need writing down.  LCLint would have found this.

Edit notes:

1. Fix: Added check for base and limit, added note for AccessSet
2. Fix: Both of these are checked.  also added note for remaining parms
3. Fix: added reference to design.mps.protan, added readership.  Rest should go 
in design.
4. Fix: added reference to design.mps.protan.fun.sync.
5. Fix: moved decl of seg, synced stays where it is.
6. Fix: as for 4
7. Fix: removed names of formals
8. Fix: design.mps.fun.protsetup
9. Fix: design.mps.protan.fun.sync.what
10 Fix: now called rReturn
11 Fix: UNUSED
12 Fix: kept synced, changed sense of its use.
13 Reject: It Uses the correct Seg iterator.
14 Reject: guide.impl.c.naming.cnc
