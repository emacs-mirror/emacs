1. PTW 18 M iso96a does not appear to explicitly allow replacment of 
set_new_handler
2. PTW - q Do we have to worry about namespace std?
3. PTW paper.iso96a I iso96a C++ already must know the size of an object, yet 
the interface to ::delete and ::delete[] do not utilize that knowledge, hence 
the size of each object must be stored twice.  I realize it is \"too late\", 
but we should be trying to create a standard, as we proposed in our MM workshop 
paper
4. PTW - q  Does the standard say anthing about how new/delete etc. interact 
with threads?
5. Sheep 8 m Should the header file contain information about redistribution ? 
This is going to be handed out to non HQ people
6. Sheep 103 m new[] is that compiler version specfic 
7. Sheep 55,84 m again this looks C++ version dependant 
8. Sheep 127 m odd usage (again ) 
9. Pekka proc.review I Is there nothing we can do to get it to print more 
widely?
10. Pekka 131 C Could reference the appropriate section of the standard.
11. PTW - NM Presumably the file that is shipped externally needs to be 
massaged to hide detail such as Hope, .readership, .sources, etc. and simply 
have a copyright at the top?
12. Sheep 43 q I thought the newHandler might be called more than once while 
loop not if

Edit notes:

1. Comment: This is so unlikely to be a problem that I won't try to fix it.
2. Mail: mail.pekka.1997-10-31.18-20(0)
3. Forget: No point in trying to get this changed.
4. Mail: mail.pekka.1997-10-31.18-20(0)
5. Reject: No, it's got the copyright.  The rest can be put in the license 
agreement.
6. Reject: Irrelevant, this is for the proposed standard.
7. Reject: As 6.
8. Reject: Standard C++ idiom.
9. Pass: GavinM
10. Fix: Added references.
11. Reject: No such requirement.  (Note: I don't see how this would be a major 
defect.)
