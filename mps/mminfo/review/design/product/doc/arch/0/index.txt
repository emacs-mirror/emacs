GavinM: 42 minutes, 5M 19m, meeting.doc.1997-01-16.docissues

Richard:
1. - C Generally good and thorough; have great confidence that doc will come 
out well if this is covered
2. .purpose M Consistency: haven't thrashed goals out between us as a group; 
needs doing
3. - M rule.design.doc.arch.readership is not met
4. .usp.tool M This isn't a selling point; got to be some benefit in itself
5. .doc-set.ref-man,.req.* M Incomplete: analysis.product.prod.sw.ref.jump not 
dealt with
6. .doc-set.user-guide M "probably": A decision needs to be made an justified
7. .doc-set.tool-ref M Inconsistent with overview.mps.usage: at what levels is 
tool used?
8. .doc-set.installation,.doc-set.relnotes M Need to be more complete: purpose 
and scope
9. - mN Bob Matthews produced a release notes questionnaire
10. USER_ANALYSIS M Lots of statements of fact with no source: Where did they 
come from?
11. .analysis.user.task M Where did these come from?  analysis.task?  Don't 
think right ones
12. .review.other,.review.usability-testing M How will these be arranged; who's 
responsible
13. .resources.other M Not complete; important
14. .schedule M No dates
15. - M Need approval for plan; no mention of this
16. .production.software,.production.binding M Unjustified decision not to use 
colour
17. .production.*,- M A lot of untagged decisions and statements (bunched 
together)
18. .issues.other M Need to state how these issues are going to be addressed
19. .schedule M What is the relationship to the software and other schedules?
20. - M Contingencies and risks not covered
21. - M Scope of documentation is not clearly stated, although it is implied
22. - M General completeness problem
23. - M How does the doc meet the goals of the OEM product 
analysis.product.prod.oem
24. .req.* M Completeness: not enough detail about how reqs of internal 
customers is to be met
25. .analysis.user M Justification: Refer to market segments in 
analysis.product.market.segs

RIT:
26. .analysis.user.key-cocepts,- M Surely more important to write new programs 
which couldn't have been written before; focussed at solving existing problems 
with software -- less appropriate as you move to higher use levels
27. - M There's nothing about legal issues.  Should the doc tell the user about 
rights to products which incorporate the MM; what liabilities are there for 
safety-critical uses
28. .usp.* M Suggest: What about the fact that the MM runs on many platforms
29. - M Should be something in guide about previous
30. .usp.* M What about extensibility, meeting.doc.1996-06-04.set.cat "up to 12 
pool classes but maybe will ship more ..."
31. .doc-set.user-guide M "first part similar to tutorial", 
meeting.doc.1996-06-04.set.guide says first part must be a quick start
32. .scope.cat M "12" can't be that definite, see meeting.doc.1996-06-04.set.cat
33. - M? surprised that two pages per pool will be enough; for some pools you 
might need quite a lot more
34. .doc-set.ol-help M "HTML" seems different from 
meeting.doc.1996-06-04.fmt.help which says Windows NT/95 and balloon help
35. .schedule.tasks M Gantt chart missing
36. .resources.people M Doesn't who will develop example code, 
meeting.doc.1996-06-04.effort.eg says by software engineers not writer
37. .review M Testing of example code should be in there
38. - M Have people considered making longer example programs that can be run, 
including them, and using extracts from them; might be useful, especially for 
formats at usage level 2; how might that tie in with CD ROM in 
meeting.doc.1996-06-04.set.quick
39. .analysis.user.task M Important that the user should be able to write 
reliable software using the MM; worth stressing how to use it in a robust way

LMB:
40. PRODUCT_PROFILE M Should mention functional specification
41. - M No explicit requirement that doc explains how to use pool classes and 
protocols in combination
42. - M No explicit req to say how the MPS will interact with client programs
43. - M No explicit req that the user be instructed to proceed through the doc 
in a certain order
44. - M No explicit req that doc teach user about GC in or not in conjunction 
with MM Book
45. - M Doc plan says "various electronic formats"; should take a stab at 
listing them

GavinM:
46. .req.explain.code M "sufficient" is under-specific
47. .schedule M Nothing about evolutionary delivery of doc, 
meeting.doc.1997-01-16.docissues.review.evolution
48. .resources.people M Usability tests: nothing about HCI
49. " M Nothing about: user analysis, a-e matrix, formal review, manufacturing, 
Tucker's competitive analysis (see 
meeting.doc.1997-01-16.docissue.guide.competitive-analysis) and generally might 
be better as a formal counter-reqs specification
50. " M Nothing about time or man-power (effort) here

Richard: 
51. - MN Example code must be explicitly tested and reviewed separately
52. - MN No mention of tie-in to MM Book
53. .req.* MN Most of these requirements aren't measurable
54. .intro m Can't tell what sort of information
55. .readership m Concept of readership not userstood here
56. rule.universal.readership I Define readership
57. .purpose m Goals should be elsewhere (goal.product.doc, perhaps)
58. .goal.* m Goals aren't quite at the right level, in my opinion, too 
specific, need shifting up
59. .req.* m Need to discuss these online, but generally OK
60. - m Incompletness: Should mention analysis.product.prod.sw.coord
61. .doc-set.ol-man m Justification: Unjustified decision with respect to 
WebMaker, etc.
62. .doc-set.* m Little discussion of why this particular doc-set is chosen
63. .scope.cat m  Where does the 12 come from?
64. .schedule.stage m Clarity: The planning stage also includes the design 
stage; should they be seperate? Should design be reviewed?
65. .schedule m Justification: Where does this schedule come from?  Is it 
standard practice?
66. .resources.information.existing m Link to or tag documents referred to here
67. .resources.information.updates m How will this be done?  Do you propose to 
attend the quartet?
68. .resources.education m Completeness: Refer to these resources properly; we 
have tags for many of them
69. .production.template m Clarify template; see previous MM doc mail
70. - m Clarity: structure of document unclear; could do with overview

RIT:
71. .analysis.user.task.ez-if m Is one developed?  When will we find out?  Will 
it delay the doc?
72. - m Example code: Are all the examples in C?  Have we considered other 
languages?
73. - m meeting.doc.1996-06-04.effort.draft: Bob estimated that the effort 
required ... is about 6 person-months.  I don't know if this agrees and I don't 
know what a "shippable first draft" is.

LMB:
74. - m Bold faced tags would make it easier to read.
75. .source m Not all sources are listed
76. - m No actual description of the levels referred to; not sure consistent 
with overview.mps.usage
77. .doc-set.ref-man q It says that it is designed for users at all levels; 
perhaps this should be levels 2 and up.
78. .doc-set.cat m Should explicitly state level of use
79. .doc-set.ol-man m Should delete word "two" because it's not yet clear how 
many ref manuals there'll be
80. .analysis.user.bckgrnd m Should specify which decision-making
81. .analysis.user.a-e-matrix m This section needs to be fleshed out; in 
particular, I need to explain how writers use the matrix
82. PROBLEM_SOLVING m Needs a note describing necessary information
83. .schedule.tasks m Needs a note that the Gantt chart is a rough estimation, 
etc, and a pointer to meeting.doc.1997-02-??
84. .schedule.stage.planning m Needs note that level of detail of outline 
depends on availability of functional specification
85. .schedule.stage.alpha m Delete parenthetical expression
86. .schedule.stage.production m Possibly PDF files should be "and other 
required electronic formats"
87. .review.usability-testing m And on outlines as well

Richard:
88. - mN Perhaps document should be split along lines of: plan; schedule; 
design; requirements; goals

GavinM:
89. .goal.internal.use m Not sure what the ML group is doing in here.
90. - m No leading dot on local tags.
91. .req.product.success.components m Could we have a reference for the 
standard components please.
92. .req.internal-use.accessibility m Clarity: I didn't understand it.
93. .req.internal-use.schedule m Vague
94. .req.explain.doc-style m Could we have a reference for the doc group style 
guidelines.
95. - m Confusion between "MM" and "MM Product"
96. .analysis.user.experience m Perhaps mention experience users have at 
reading manuals written in English.
97. .analysis.user.task m Last line beginning "problem solving" -- don't know 
what line is doing here or what it means.
98. .analysis.user.task.ez-if m What's the EZ interface?  Can we have a 
reference?
99. .schedule.stage.beta and others m Clarity: "Including comments" isn't clear.
100. .schedule.stage m There's nothing about change tracking as mentiong in 
meeting.doc.1997-01-16.docissues.review.change-tracking.
101. .review.formal m What's the difference between design and outline?
102. .review.formal m Define template.
103. .review.other m What are technical, editorial, and marketing reviews?



Brainstorm start: 16:36
Brainstorm end: 17:27


BRAINSTORM:

3. GavinM: I thought .analysis.user.bkgrnd and .analysis.user.experience met 
this well.  
Richard: Should state it explicitly.  Should it be clear that rules are met?
GavinM: Reviewability adds the attribute that consistency and compliance should 
be clear, not just true.

10. LMB: This is one of the major categories of defect.  Lots of statements 
were made that weren't justified or had source.  This was an education 
problem.  I wasn't aware until last week that things must be justified 
explicitly.
Richard: PI?  Better training?  Something to read?  Some policy document?
LMB: That would be useful for AndrewS and myself.
Richard: Should have "Bizarre customs and practices of the MM Group: An 
anthropological study for outsiders (with lithograph)"
LMB: Documents in MM InfoSys about review process might be a place to start.  
I'm not convinced that they're comprehensive.  Gilb?
Richard: Gilb doesn't go on about justification as much.
GavinM: Developing documents for people bringing documents to review; hard.
Richard: It's hard for us to describe things which are odd to outsiders.
LMB: Someone said I should look at analysis.task, and I wasn't aware that it 
existed.  It should list major documents.
Richard: The problem is that we don't have a product description for you to 
work on.  We need to create a "functional spec" -- a top-level description of 
the product and its design.  With that you could write this document much 
better.  
GavinM: Guide on how to find documents on a particular subject.
LMB: Searching in Notes comes up with too many.
GavinM: Categorised by keyword

12. Richard: New rule: It's not enough to wish for something.  You have to set 
the wheels in motion to make it happen.  This document expressed your need for 
information and for other people to do work, but doesn't make it happen.  I've 
found it good to write down how I'm going to make it happen.  Suppose you had 
to give the document to someone else?  For example, do you want to come into 
quartet meetings?

22. Richard: Document doesn't cover all the things it needs to.  How did you 
know what to put in this document?  Have you seen one before?
LMB: Not exactly.  Most of the ones I've seen before are far less complete.  I 
worked from a textbook.  Technical writing classes weren't this complete.  Will 
bring over books.
Richard: The general way to solve completeness problems is to have a procedure 
or a template.  We're not likely to produce many more documentation plans for 
products, but the Doc Group is.  It would be useful to create a general 
procedure or template/outline to record best practice.  Checklist.  Starting 
with book was good.
LMB: Surprised it didn't have contingincies and legal issues.
Richard: Leah needs to work out how worthwhile this is.
LMB: Before the textbook, I used the HSIS doc plan, which was structured around 
the information from a meeting.  There is an evolution going on and it would be 
worthwhile to record it.  
GavinM: Falls between us.

37,51. GavinM: Hidden technical requirement of documentation
Richard: Need rule for example code.  Is it a special case of examples?
GavinM: Examples must be correct, part of document.
Richard: Thoroughly checked and QA-ed.
GavinM: QA needs to track interface changes for this.
RIT: Also needs to be exemplary code
LMB: What is this about interface changes?
Richard: Interface changes are particularly upsetting for interface changes.  
We need procedure for interface changes to allow for all the consequences.  We 
can no longer just go ahead.  action

53. Richard: Goal is what you want to acheive; requirements are set of 
statements which, if all true, are sufficient to do it.  They have to be "yes 
or no".  Can't be "quite small".  Need to decide whether you can meet all reqs 
without meeting goals, inwhich case  you are missing reqs.  Or, if you can meet 
goals without meeting all rews, in which case some are superfluous.  Need 
guide.goal and guide.req.

Minor. Richard: Not convinced that all minor issues were worthwhile.  Probably 
swept away by major changes.  
GavinM: Decided to bear cost in view of two newcomers.
Richard: Could ask people to log half, and bear in mind the weeping away.

Question. LMB: You said you chose six, but they fell into categories.  Are 
there always categories?  
GavinM: Not entirely, sometimes mail round, some categories on 
process.review.ref
Richard: Classification not useful in general.  Might highlight phase, but 
doesn't acheive things in general.
GavinM: Completeness is major, but not generally helpful.

-> RIT: What's the optimum length of document.
GavinM: <1 hour checking.  Different documents in same session.
RIT: What about defects found from two documents.
GavinM: Don't tend to do related documents, e..g design and impl.
Richard: Should stand alone.  Oughtened to use for finding out.  Design should 
be reviewable in itself.  Mustn't use group knowledge.  
GavinM: Difficult to avoid skipping unclarity.
Richard: Same with justification.  Should be able to get anyone to review; 
that's why readership is important.
GavinM: Suggest swapping checkers with ML group.
LMB: Potential problem might be that I showed this document to Ken Jackson at 
an early stage.  He gave a few comments, but they were nowhere as detailed.

-> LMB: What is the future of this document.  
Richard: You need to meet Gavin, also guide.edit.
GavinM: To many major defects
Richard: Needs to be edited and re-reviewed in this case.  Same for code.  
GavinM: Numbers are changeable.
Richard: Some defects can be let through.  We need to be quite strict with this 
document.
GavinM: A major defect could be said to be a defect that causes a defect in a 
downstream product.
LMB: Want to discuss goals and requirements while in England.
GavinM: What about e-mail?
LMB: Could make a start.
Richard: It's up to you.
