DRJ:
8. header m check.rule.accept

13. check.text.format.emphasis I change underscore for low-line
14. - IN All documents for review should have line numbers

PTW: 
15. - q Square brackets?

documentation
33. .cons m check.text.format.list.short.inline; short list is not inlined.

BRAINSTORM:

1. What's the difference between truth and consistency?  Need to define truth.  
Example in source comment was inconsistent with source.  Richard often wants to 
write false statements.  NickB cites meeting minutes as an example; Richard 
replies that we should have a rule that meeting minutes should reflect the 
meeting.  In what way would rule.universal.true benefit the project?  
Inconsistency is a better defect to isolate.

2. What does .risk say about the absence of risk?  Need to clarify phrasing?  
Risk role?

3. Tucker suggested that Gavin treat him as a new employee.  Could we get a 
real conference phone?  Tucker can't get a word in edgeways.

4. Richard suggests review process discussion as separate.


Number of major issues: 2
Number of minor issues: 22
Number of issues: 36
Major defects remaining: 2

Edit manpower: 8


Edit notes:

1. Rejected because consistency is more important.
2. Fixed
3. Rephrased
4. Fixed.
5. .cons.guide added
6. rule.rule rephrased slightly
7. Comment added to rule.rule
8. Will be fixed retrospectively.
9. added to .scope
10. Will be alright when approved.
11. Read as "shouldn't"; made non-comment
12. Partly covered by .once, partly dependent on document type.
13. Little benefit; reject
14. No.  True for implementations. Added to type.impl
15. See guide.text.comment
16. Reference to guide.text.comment added.
17. Comment clarified
18. Comment added to .risk
19. Rephrased.
20. Reference to design.infosys added
21. Reference to design.infosys added
22. Covered by .cons
23. Added to .scope
24. check.universal updated
25. check.text.format is long enough.  Perhaps we should have a check.tag, but 
tags are well covered in, e.g., check.impl.*. Reject for now.
26. Changed to "it"
27. Split into .head.*
28. Changed to comment
29. See 28
30. Readership now in double quotes
31. Merged as .clear
32. Rephrased

34. Tags act as bullets.
35. No known risk, therefore no .risk
36. True, but not worth fixing.
