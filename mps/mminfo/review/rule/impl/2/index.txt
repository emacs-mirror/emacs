ISSUES:

NickB: 1M 1m 1I  10 minutes
PTW: 3m  9 minutes
GavinM: 1M 2m 1I  5 minutes
DRJ: 1m  9 minutes

1. NickB - M rule.rule.page 10 lines too long
2. NickB - m Consistency: Some rules have justifications, some do not
3. GavinM - m Clarity: "may" throughout, might be better as "must"
4. GavinM - m Clarity: Better if the rule statements and justifications were 
distinguishable
5. GavinM - I Should be rule about previous
6. DRJ .scope m No readership
7. PTW .simple,.adapt m Sub-clauses of min; should be one rule
8. PTW .min "assert out" is unclear
9. PTW .mod Unclear: I think this means "Don't peek inside other modules", not 
"put you assumptions in your interface"
10. NickB rule.rule.sc I Letter "e" missing
11. NickB rule.universal I Fails to meet rule.rule.page

BRAINSTORM:

1. GavinM: General problem with rules and procedures, because the statements 
are mixed with justification, discussion, and examples.  Want implementation 
and rule to enable skimming your eye down rule statements.
NickB: Could have rules at top, and rest at bottom.  
GavinM: Weakens link between rule and justification.  Could have line break 
between rule and follow on.
NickB: That would just make the document longer.
PTW: Could make Notes truncate rulesets at one page.
GavinM: Could have rulesets with two text fields on form, for rules and 
discussion
DRJ: General separation of documents from meta-information.  Same thing came up 
in design documents.
GavinM: Discussion is design for rulesets.
GavinM: Rulesets are absolute, unarguable, and divorced from detail.  
Guidelines are arbitrary rules because they're a good idea.
DRJ: No, because guidelines guide.

NickB: I felt that we should have had design.mps.prot.
GavinM: It's author wouldn't let me use it.
DRJ: If they were both complete, they would be wonderful source documents.
