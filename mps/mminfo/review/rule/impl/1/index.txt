ISSUES:

Richard: 2M, 14m, 2C, 1I
DRJ: 2M, 3m, 1q
NickB: 6m, 3q
GavinM: 1M, 8m

Richard: 
1. .scope m readership?
2. .scope m purpose?
3. .trans m clarity; what is transition
4. .trans m typo; applied should be applies
5. .trans m typography, no comma after ie
6. .quality m "other rules", inconsistent with .trans
7. .req C The design must make it clear how
8. .simple C But no simpler
9. .simple m Change parenthesis to "meet .req"
10. .platform m Delete the word implementation
11. .open m clairty: define open-ended
12. .confine M wrong; should be minimal to meet requirements
13. .symbolic m consistency; constraint = limitation?
14. .regress M unclear; does it mean deltas to implementations; what is a 
regression
15. .guide m probably proc.impl.*.guide
16. .dep m change "requires" to "would require"
17. .design m insert "of" after "doc...n"
18. .justify m ambiguous; what is statement?
19. rule.rule I What is the form of a rule?

DRJ: 
20. .trans m This should be broken up according ot rule.universal.tag
21. .open q Does this justification belong here?
22. top M Quality and trick should be defined
23. .guide m type should be language
24. .guide mN proc.impl.*.guide should be guide.impl.*
25. .design m grammar/typo in first sentence

NickB:
26. .trans,.quality m The relationship between the "all transgressions" 
sentences is unclear
27 .platform m "the" should read "there"
28. .confine m What is a module leader?
29. .symbolic q Does this apply to constants which are not constraints?
30. .open q Does this cover scaleability?

GavinM:
31. .trans m incomplete, transitional status shoudl be indicated
32. .quality m clarity, unclear precedence with .trans
33. .symbolic M this is either very unclear or wrong
34. .mod m erm, phrasing is ambiguous. erm, "that"'s antecedent is unclear
35. .justify m I don't believe the author meant justification

NickB (again):
36. .justify mN clarity: What does "from the code" mean?



Brainstorm start: 16:15
Brainstorm end: 16:34
Brainstorm length: 19


BRAINSTORM:

12. Could be redundant, not wrong.  Aim was to avoid gumph and code which does 
things that's outside its responsibility.  Possibly there should be a rule 
about redundancy, at least in rules.  Maybe.  .confine is good in its placement 
immediately after .open.

14. Copied from Gilb in a blind fashion.  New rule: Don't copy without thinking.

22. .trick does define "tricks".  rule to say that terms must be defined.  
rule.rule?  Wider rule not to use longer words for new concepts.  Glossary?

33. This document is higher-level than concrete C examples.  Three terms which 
need definition.

No reference sheets.  Reference sheet could be visually more accesible.

rule.check: If you have to scan a question more than once, it is unclear.

Process brainstorm discusses solutions, not process.

Lots of fiddling about during kick off.
