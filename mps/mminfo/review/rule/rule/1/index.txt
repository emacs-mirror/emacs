CHECKING

Start: 13:00
End:   13:15
15 work minutes each
Issues: drj 0/4, dsm 1/2, richard 2/1

1. drj: Shouldn't the first revision be 0?
2. dsm: Didn't mention guide.text in review form.
3. drj: Doesn't rule.tag imply rule.new?
4. richard: Scope of rules should be stated.
5. dsm: Content of rules isn't addressed by rule.rule. (relevance, 
completeness, consistency, etc.)
6. richard: rule.universal doesn't mention consistency
7. dsm: What does 60 lines of plain text mean?
8, 9. drj: Rule scope isn't tagged itself. (rule.universal.hier, .tag)
10. drj: rule.universal.note: "They therefore..." should be in square brackets.
11. richard: There's a risk over messing about with rules so much that we don't 
get any real work done.  (rule.universal.risk)

PROCESS BRAINSTORM

1. The rule set for rules doesn't guarantee relevance of rules.
2. What is the purpose of rules?
3. Shouldn't all documents include a statement of purpose?
4. Checklists are needed!

Rules are defined for every doc type.
Req's for rules: They should contribute to meeting requirements.
Rules strive to be complete, in that, if applied perfectly, they would ensure 
that the document met requirements.  Do we reject rule sets for which this is 
not true?


EDIT

Issues dealt with as follows:
1. This is not an issue for rule.rule, but an issue to be cleared up with the 
tagging scheme.  I've made a note about this on my desktop.
2. This was a mistake on the review form.
3. rule.rule.new was ambiguously stated.  Now restated.
4. Added a new rule, rule.sc, requiring scope to be stated.
5. Added rule.universal.complete.
6. Added rule.universal.cons.
7. Qualified rule.rule.page.
8. See 4.
9. Done.
10. Done.
11. Added comment to scope.
12. Added rule.universal.purpose.
13. See 5.


FOLLOW-UP

Richard notes that Richard has dealt with all issues.

The estimated number of major defects remaining is 3, according to Gilb's 
initial rule of thumb (book.gilb93, p106).

No exit criteria are defined.  Using Gilb's initial ones (3 majors) then 
rule.rule passes and is accepted.
