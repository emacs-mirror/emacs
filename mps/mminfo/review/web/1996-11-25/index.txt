ISSUES:

Lost AndiH

DRJ:
1. C/HN m Memory Management ... in different paragraph
2. C++ m Probably irrelevant
3. cache policy m Should come after entry for cache
4. cache policy m Not useful; examples and references
5. cahce(3) m Too vague to be useful
6. CAML m Useless
7. car/cdr m Not opposites
8. glossary I Separate section for languages
9. MACLISP m Interesting, but not relevant or useful
10. main memory m Gloss and link RAM and ROM
11. mapped m Plural of UNIX is horrible
12. mark-compact m Doesn't mention that mark-compact prevents fragmentation 
problems
13. faq.gc.lang m BASIC (mostly) is clumsy
14. " m This whole question is quite important and deserves more advocacy and 
attention
15. faq.lib.grow,faq.x.reset m Although interesting, hard to believe anyone 
coming to the site would ask these
16. faq.gc.adv m Should be added that it's often faster than man mem man
17. faq.gc.adv m Second paragraph should be expanded; add note that GC reduces 
copying
18. html.glossary.full.leader m We should state in first sentence, or as new 
second sentence, why we have this as one document and refer to copyright
19. html.copyright m Printout and copy?
only got that far

NickB:
20. c m K&R1 should be in Bib/link
21. C++ M This word "usually" should be sometimes, because it's incorrect
22. C++ m Should get rid of or add something about mem man
23. calloc m Should mention returning NULL
24. calloc q Why do we talk about ANSI C and not ISO?
25. manual memory management m First sentence is ugly
26. " m Second sentence: "does not scale" is untrue; qualify
27. "/HN m fifties->1950s
28. "/HN m Second sentence; strike "nowadays"
29. mapped/mapping m UNIX spelling
30. mapping/diagram q Which way up do we draw memory maps, and do we draw them 
all the same way?
31. faq.gc.lang m e/use/require/
32. " m Add sentence about use in C/C++
33. " m Java should be nearer head of list
34. " m ML could be be added
35. faq.lib.grow m Second last para, word missing
36. faq.gc.adv m First sentence could profitably be shortened; and example
37. html.glossary.full.leader m Should say why we are providing this and why 
entries are different
38. html.copyright/trademarks q Why is HARLEQUIN from upper case
39. html.news/History m Jones book "dedicated ... collection", "concerned soley 
with ..."
40. " c Could put MM history here 1959 -- GC invented
41. html.news/Future m Add two June conferences ICFP and PLDI

LMB:
42. C m Explain "portable assembler"
43. C/HN m last sentence -- punctuation makes it a little confusing
44. C++ m Why "partly"
45. cache policy m Second sentence e/;/,/
46. cache(1) m Why so much faster
47. cache(2) m second sentence: "there" what does it refer to?
48. calloc m Second paragraph, point out noe and es as arguments, noe poor 
phrase
49. " m 2para,2sen make more explicit 
50. " m 2para,3-4sen Why would you want to do this?
51. car/cdr m Could break down
52. cdr m "From Lisp" out of place
53. cdr m "Also known as tail" wrong antecedent
54. cdr/HN m menomic
55. MACLISP m Too many parenthetical expressions; first antecedent isn't clear
56. " m last sent: comma after later
57. main memory m "for instance" doesn't mean a lot to me at that point.  First 
sentence is confusing by itself.
58. mapped m Didn't understand definition; could we have a diagram?
59. mapping m Didn't understand "to trap"; diagram could have a little more 
information
60. mark-compact m What is address ordering?
61. faq.x.reset m Why wasn't it written with GC in the first place
62. html.copyright m First sentence: copyright in
63. html.news c Could break out changes and news

GavinM:
64. C m "systems" is slightly inaccurate
65. C/HN m e/-/--/
66. C/HN m _lifetimes_
67. C/HN m last sentence, errors should be linked to use after free and memory 
leak
68. C++ Nm See also: new, delete
69. cache(1) m First clause in unclear, suggest "computer's memory cache"
70. " m 3para; Suggest see storage level
71. calloc m 2para Should reference standard for setting zero values
72. CAML m Should say what it stands for
73. car/cdr m last car 1para not italics, second car 2para should be in CODE
74. MACLISP m 2sent HN
75. " m e/--/ -- /
76. " m LCS has web site
77. " q Why BIBOP
78. " m Bib: Greenberg77
79. manual memory management m Bib: Boehn collector
80. mapped m RMM: third line of first sent pooly phrased
81. mark-compact m DIAGRAMS: Should have links in captions
82. " m See also compaction

systematically

DRJ:
100. cache(1) Nm e/computer's/processor's/
101. calloc Nm I'm dubious as to the usefulness of this and it's quite complex
102. main memory m  Could add examples W4W 16M

NickB:
103. cache(1) m e/piece of small fast memory/small piece of fast memory/

BRAINSTORM:

LMB: Very interesting; liked not commenting -- more comfotable.  Wished doc 
group used it.

21. C++ usually into C.  GavinM's knowledge of C++ is 3 years' out of date.  
Mail entries round.  Initial ones weren't tracked.  Could mail round now -- any 
proft?  A bit.  Some work and a flood.

95. News track update register.  Idea which got lost.  Information in too many 
places.  Have process improvements.  Need to go back and check that I've got 
everything.  

DRJ: Found hard to review.  Unaccustomed to review, and lack of rules and 
guidelines.
NickB: Lots of aesthetic decisions.  Phrasing and selection.  How much do you 
want to say?  Definition, not exposition, but small exposition useful.  
Articles.  Caches?

NickB: Much better than previous attempt to review HTML.

LMB: Will we be reviewing all of it?  Not necessarily.  Defects, process, known 
quality.
