INTRODUCTION

.intro: This document is an analysis of the design decision made in PoolLO 
(reflected in design.mps.poollo).  It serves as background for, justification 
of, and discussion about the design (design.mps.poollo).  In particular 
alternate designs are mentioned and the justification for choosing one design 
over another.

MISC

.scan.ambig: see review.impl.c.lo.29 issue 19.  One way to avoid having to 
protect the objects in this pool is to scan all of their references atomically 
during flip.  At the moment poollo doesn't do _any_ scanning at all, so this 
would introduce extra complication into it.
