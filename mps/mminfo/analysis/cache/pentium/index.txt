INTRODUCTION

.intro: This is a summary of the cache on an Intel Pentium Processor.  It 
describes the on-chip instruction and data caches.

Architecture and Programming Manual") Chapter 18.

DEFINITIONS

.def.byte: With regard to Pentium processors, a byte is 8 bits.

.def.line: A line is a unit used when discussing caches.  Typically it is the 
unit of transfer to and from external memory (although read and write policy 
may affect this).  [this definition should be somewhere else and referred to 
from here]


DESCRIPTION

.split: The pentium has separate on-chip instruction and data caches.

.size: The instruction and data caches hold 8Kb each.

.line.size: A single cache line is 32 bytes (256 bits).

.line.fill:  Filling a cache line takes 4 bus cycles (4 64-bit transfers) in 
burst mode, taking at least 5 clocks.

.transfer.unit: The cache is filled from external memory devices with a series 
of transfers.  Transfers take place in units of 64 bits (the memory bus to 
external memory devices is 64 bits wide).
