.meaning: An "accepted" document has been completed by the author, and has 
passed review and been accepted (see proc.review).  Since the document has 
passed the exit criteria for review of a document of its type, it has a fairly 
accurate prediction of the number of defects remaining.  Its contents may be 
considered reliable.

process successfully.

information.

.rule.quote: The tag of an accepted can be quoted, because the tag shouldn't 
change.

.rule.tag: The tag of an accepted document should not be changed without 
informing everyone who might know about the document and searching for cross 
references in other documents.
