.meaning: The "incomplete" status indicates that the creator of the document 
does not consider it to be finished.

.use.create: The incomplete status is useful if you want to _create_ a document 
(in order to bind a tag to it) but don't have time to finish writing it yet.  
For example, when starting a procedure which creates a document foo.bar, it is 
useful to create foo.bar as an incomplete document and make some brief notes in 
it.

.rule.source: An incomplete document should not be used as a source of 
information without first contacting the creator to ascertain the veracity of 
its contents.

.rule.quote: The tag of an incomplete document can be quoted elsewhere, since 
the status indicates that the creator intends to complete the document at some 
point (cf. with status.temporary.rule.tag).

.rule.tag: The tag of an incomplete document should not be changed without 
informing everyone who might know about the document and searching for cross 
references in other documents.
