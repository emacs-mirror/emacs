Scope: These rules are to be applied to requirement statements (documents of type 
"fun" and "attr"), and accompany the process of requirements analysis.


.result: State requirements in terms of final needs, not means.

.scale: The requirement statement must define a scale on which the product's 
satisfaction of the requirement can be measured.

.test: The requirement statement must define a test which can be applied to 
determine whether the requirements is satisfied.

.source: Indicate whence the requirement came in such a way that the source can 
be traced unquestionably and unambiguously.  [Include attributions, meeting 
reference, relevant mail messages, etc.]

.sep: Clearly separate functional requirements (without scale) from attribute 
requirements (with scale).  [Should be about whether satsfaction is boolean, 
not about whether a scale is involved.  gavinm 1998-04-14]
