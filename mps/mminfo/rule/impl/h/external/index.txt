Scope: This rule set applies to C header files which are part of an MM deliverable, 
and are therefore visible to MM clients.


.doc.ref: Every declaration must be accompanied by a reference to the relevant 
section of the client documentation.

.doc.no.client: The interface file should not document the interface for the 
client directly (see .doc.ref).

.doc.no.internal: The interface file may not contain any internal 
documentation.  All internal documentation that would be included in the file 
under normal rules should be shifted into the corresponding design document 
with a tag in the interface.

.doc.usage: The interface may contain comments documenting usage restrictions, 
such as "/* DIRECT USE OF THIS WILL NOT BE SUPPORTED */".

.param: Function prototypes must not name their parameters.  See 
guide.impl.c.misc.prototype.parameters for details.

.identifiers: All identifiers (functions, variables, types, struct/union tags, 
enum/struct/union members, macros, macro parameters) should begin with one of: 
"MPS_", "mps_", "_mps_".  See design.mps.interface.c(0).naming.
