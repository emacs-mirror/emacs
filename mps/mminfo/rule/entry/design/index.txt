Scope: These entry criteria are to be used for reviews of design documents.  Our aim 
is for failure to prevent entry.  In the meantime, failure of one of these 
criteria must be documented in the review document and entry prevention is at 
the leader's discretion.


.rfc: Any design document entering formal review must have previously been 
reviewed informally, e.g. by e-mail RFC, or design brainstorm.
