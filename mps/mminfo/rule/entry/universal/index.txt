Scope: These entry criteria are to be used for all reviews.  Our aim is for failure to 
prevent entry.  In the meantime, failure of these must be documented in the 
review record and entry prevention is at the leader's discretion.


.author: The author of the document agrees to the review.

.source-available: The source documents are available in writing.

.source-approved: The source documents will have exited review.  Failing this, 
they should be mini-reviewed and the fact noted.  Failing this, they should be 
marked as "UNREVIEWED".

.rules-available: The relevant rules are available in writing.

.rules-approved: The rule documents have exited review.  Failing this, see 
.source-approved.

.brief-check: The leader has performed a cursory examination and has found no 
more than one major defect (see guide.review.class.major) per page.

.plan: There is a procedure for the review, including checking rates for this 
type of document.

.training: The leader has been formally trained and certified in Inspection.

.auto-check: All automatic checks have been performed on the product document, 
and it has passed.
