Scope: These are additional entry criteria for the review of code.  See 
entry.universal.


.author: In the case of code there is often not a clear author.  In this case, 
the leader may select one or more people who have edited the file recently, at 
his discretion.

.auto-check: Source code should compile without errors.  Lint should have been 
run where available.
