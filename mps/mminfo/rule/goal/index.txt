Scope: This document specifies rules with which goals and goal sets should comply, 
whether in a goal.* document, or in some other document such as an analysis.


Goals

.aim: Goals must give a clear direction which can be worked towards.

.sol: Goals must not mandate particular solutions.

.version: Goals must be independent of specific product versions.

.nec: It must be necessary to achieve a goal in order to satisfy the parties 
involved.

.tag: Goal tags should be highly mnemonic.  [This is more important than for 
other documents.]


Goal Sets

.min: In a goal set, there must be no goal which is a subset of another.  It is 
permissible to break a goal down into sub-goals, but this structure must be 
clear.

.max: In a goal set, there should be no way of achieving all the goals which 
leaves the parties involved unsatisfied.  In particular, goals are used to 
justify decisions and work.  If we want to do things which aren't justified by 
the goals, then the goal set is incomplete, or we are wrong.

.identify: Goal sets must include an identification of who the "parties 
involved" are who are driving the goals, or a reference to where this is 
defined.

[ These rules contain nothing about how finely goals should be divided. --
