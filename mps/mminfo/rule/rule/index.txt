Scope: These rules apply to documents of type "rule" (known as "rules" or "rule 
sets").  [They therefore apply to themselves.]

[RISK: This document is two-removed from actual work.  Messing around with it 
is risky because it could detract from getting the actual documents written. --

.accept: Review and accept rules against these rules (rule.rule) and the 
universal rules (rule.universal) before using them. [This isn't a rule for 
rules, it's a procedure for using them.  See also 
review.rule.universal.3.issue.7 - GavinM]

.page: The rules document mustn't exceed 60 lines of plain text, when formatted 
according to guide.text with each rule in a separate paragraph.

.tag: Every rule should be tagged with a unique name.

.new: Tags that have been used for a different rule in the past should not be 
reused.

.sc: The scope (domain) of rule sets should be stated, and tagged as ".scope".
