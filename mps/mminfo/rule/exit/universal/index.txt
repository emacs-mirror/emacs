Scope: These criteria should be used for the exit from review of all documents.  See 
book.gilb93, page 202.


.edit: The editor has taken written action on all issues, recorded in the 
review record; these may include rejecting the issue.

.quest: All questions to the author (q) should have been answered in mail to 
mm, and possibly in documentation.
 
.imp: All improvement suggestions (I) should have resulted in one of the 
following:
  .imp.edit: Edit of another document; not if it is already approved.
  .imp.mail: Passed on to someone responsible for the other document, and 
accepted.
  .imp.issue: Escalated to an InfoSys issue.
  .imp.reject: Rejected by the editor for a documented reason.

.record: All fields have been filled in in the review record, including 
metrics, and estimated defects remaining.

.defects: The estimated defects remaining is less than the acceptable level for 
the document type.  In the absence of a more specific level, use 2 major 
defects (see guide.review.class.major) per page.

.rates: The checking and logging rates did not exceed the optimum rates by more 
that 20% on average. [Being too slow is ok.]

.veto.author: The author does not wish to veto exit.

.veto.leader: The leader does not wish to veto exit.
