ARCHITECTURE:

.aver: The AVER macro takes a Bool (condition) and may or may not call ASSERT, 
raising an assertion, depending on the target (see impl.h.target).

.avert: The AVERT macro takes a type and a value and invokes type-specific 
checking on that type, raising an assertion (depending on target).
