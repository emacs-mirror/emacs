.intro: This document describes the use of serial numbers in the MPM.

.overview: Serial numbers are used to uniquely name all possible client 
creatable objects and structures (spaces, pools, roots, formats, threads, 
buffers).  They have little use at present, but are intended to be used in 
logging and dumping.
