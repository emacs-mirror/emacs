.variants: variants are particular combinations of format methods and values.  
Each variant is a structure type and has a pure name.  The names are simply 
'variant A', 'variant B' and so on.  Not very evocative, but at least it makes 
naming them easy.  The corresponding types are called mps_fmt_A_s, mps_fmt_B_s, 
and so on.

These methods [the ones in a format] are provided by clients in order to 
describe to
a pool class how to manage objects in client-specific formats.  They
are part of the Format object (see impl.h.mpmst.format).

There are some more notes about format methods in meeting.qa.1996-10-16.
