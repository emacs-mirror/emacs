.intro: The ANSI fake VM is an implementation of the MPS VM interface (see 
design.mps.vm) using services provided by the ANSI C Library (standard.ansic.7) 
(malloc and free as it happens).

.align: The VM is aligned to VMAN_ALIGN (defined in impl.h.mpmconf) by adding 
VMAN_ALIGN to the reqested size, mallocing a block that large, then rounding 
the pointer to the base of the block.  vm->base is the aligned pointer, 
vm->block is the pointer returned by malloc (used when during VMDestroy).
