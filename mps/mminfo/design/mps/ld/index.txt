INTRODUCTION

.intro: This is the design of the location dependency module in the MPS.  
Location dependencies are datastructures which represent (compactly and 
efficiently of course) a set of objects whose location the client has depended 
on.  They are intended to be used by the client to manage the rehashing of 
address based hash tables.  See also guide.mps.ld(2) for more user oriented 
documentation.


IMPLEMENTATION

.correspond: a version of LDStruct is exported to the client (in the C 
interface as mps_ld_s).  The two versions should correspond.

[some of this design (nor written down, *sigh*) is really quite subtle.  take 
care.  drj 1999-06-22]

(A very small amount of the design is covered in design.mps.arena(2).ld.*)
