OVERVIEW:

NSEG stands for "Non-allocating SEGments".  The MNSEG Pool Class manages 
segments for the benefit of the arena reservoir.  It refuses all allocation 
requests and as such is not a useful pool any purpose other than the reservoir. 
It exists as a pool class so that segments in the reservoir can belong to a 
pool, like all other committed segments.
