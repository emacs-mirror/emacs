.req.client.minimum: Clients of the MPS may want certain objects or sets of 
objects to be allocated with a certain minimum alignment.  Either for 
efficiency reasons (alignment with cache lines; some architecture impose a 
performance penalty for misaligned access), to use certain instruction which 
may require a particular alignment (some architecture will fault on misaligned 
access), or to steal bits from the address (for low order bits of an aligned 
address can be used for tagging for example), or perhaps for some other reason.

.req.client.maximum: Clients may require that internal fragmentation be below a 
certain threshold which may imply requirements on the maximum alignment of 
certain objects (aligning objects too strictly will increase internal 
fragmentation).

.req.platform.abi: Certain platform ABIs may require that C compilers and other 
parts of the system which interoperate give objects particular (usually 
minimum) alignments and dictate other aspects such as structure layout.  This 
has implication if you want to allocate memory for storing C objects in.

.req.platform.no-abi: Even if there is no well defined ABI for a platform the C 
compilers (say) on that platform may make certain assumptions about the 
alignment of objects.  A memory manager for C will have to worry about this.
