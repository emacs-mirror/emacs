INTRODUCTION

.intro: This is the design of the support in the MPS for describing and 
inspecting versions.

OVERVIEW

.overview: There different sorts of version under consideration: Versions of 
the (MPS) library used (linked with), versions of the interface used (header 
files in C) when compiling the client's program, versions of the documentation 
used when the client was writing the program.  There are issues of programmatic 
and human access to these versions.

.overview.split: The design is split accordingly.  See 
design.mps.version-library for the design of a system for determining the 
version of the library one is using.  And other non-existant documents for the 
others.
