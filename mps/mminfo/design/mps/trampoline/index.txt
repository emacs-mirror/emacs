OVERVIEW
  - catching and handling memory protection faults

    - under Win32, using Structured Exception Handling (SEH)

    - on other architectures by signal handler installation? [don't know yet]

CONTEXT
Fault handling is required in order to implement the "hard" barrier without 
support from the mutator.  [Link?] 

i/f:
- Trampoline
  Calls a function which may access "automatically managed memory".  Used to 
install fault handler.  Whether this needs to be used must be defined on a per 
pool basis.  (Depends on whether pool may protect memory.)

nt:
- trampoline
  - wraps a structured exception handler around the function
  - filter function calls the fault handler
  - exception handler block is not reached
