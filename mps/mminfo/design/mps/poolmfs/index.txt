OVERVIEW:

MFS stands for "Manual Fixed Small".  The MFS Pool Class manages objects that 
are of a fixed size.  It is intended to only manage small objects efficiently.  
Storage is recycled manually by the client programmer.

A particular instance of an MFS Pool can manage objects only of a single size, 
but different instances can manage objects of different sizes.  The size of 
object that an instance can manage is declared when the instance is created.
