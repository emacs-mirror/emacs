REQUIREMENTS:

req: The requirements are not fully known. They are inherited from req.epcore, 
and from other requirements on the MPS. They include:

.req.client: Manage memory provided by the client.  .req.client.only: Operate 
entirely within client-provided memory.

.req.extend: Allow extension by the client providing additional chunks of 
memory.  .req.extend.few: Normal operation will be in one chunk; "a few" chunks 
is unusual; "many" chunks is very unlikely.

.req.extend.slow: Speed may degrade proportionally to the number of chunks of 
memory.

.req.place: Allow preferential placement of segments, particularly offer a 
atrategy that has a high probability of returning successive segments 
(upwards).


TEXT:

 - client arena 

.improve.remember: One possible performance improvement is to remember (a 
conservative approximation to) the indices of the first and last free pages in 
each chunk, and start searching from these in ChunkSegAlloc. See 
request.epcore.170534.
