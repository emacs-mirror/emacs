INTRODUCTION:

This document is the design of the MPS meter mechanism.  Meters can be used to 
gather simple statistical information in MPS code.

OVERVIEW:

The MPS meter system is a set of routines for gathering limited statistical 
information at run time when telemetry (design.mps.telemetry(1)) is not 
enabled.


TEXT:

This is a placeholder for a design for a system for metering MPS code.  A 
prototype implementation exists as MMsrc!meter.h and MMsrc!meter.c.  Tony has 
created something similar called STATISTIC.  The design needs to integrate the 
requirements of both.  Meters (and statistics) are more correctly a part of the 
telemetry system, as anything that is a candidate for metering is just as well 
a candidate for telemetry.  Meters are more limited than telemetry as they only 
permit monitoring of a single value.  They obviate the need for telemetry by 
accumulating 0th - 2nd moments of the population on line rather than emitting 
the population for off-line analysis.  These moments are used to compute the 
mean and standard deviation of the population.  Unfortunately, the on-line 
method of computing the standard deviation is numerically unstable.  (Higher 
moments are more unstable, so are not accumulated at all.  To calclutate 
average deviation, skewness and kurtosis, telemetry should be used to emit the 
entire population for off-line analysis.
