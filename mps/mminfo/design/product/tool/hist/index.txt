INTRODUCTION:

This document is intended as a way of thinking about possible ways that the 
tool might present information. The drawings are intended to be indicative of 
how the view might look in a window.


OVERVIEW:

This view displays a histogram of allocated object size against time. The 
histogram is cut into 4 to 10 bins. Each histogram is represented with a flat 
plane cut-out. The histogram plane is shaded to represent 'depth', the bottom 
axis (time) is marked with horizonal lines representing garbage collection 
periods.  This axis also displays user message events.

Each histogram plane has 'subplanes' associated with it. Each subplane 
represents a user colour band (shown in the legend). 

.interaction 

Clicking on a histogram plane shows (possibly replacing the legend if there is 
not enough space) allocation points and types for those items making up the 
histogram. As time passes the histogram moves from left to right. 

zooming - may show more detailed histogram (not in diagram due to problems with 
polygons in Visio). For example, this might show up more sub-bands, so a 
10kbyte band may divided into 1- 4, 4-6, 6- 8, 8-10 sub-bands. 

.Options:  Again the problem is whether to show the vertical axis by total 
memory or memory * allocations.  Should the vertical axis be compressed using 
(log(x)) to underplay the allocation of certain points?


TESTING:

One way of testing these diagrams is to ask your self if the function of the 
chart was immediately obvious after looking at the diagram ? Could you think of 
a use for the view might you find this view useful. If you think of ways of 
improving the chart and adding more elements too it them again it might be more 
useful than one you cannot think of adding to
