INTRODUCTION:

this is another attempt at makeing a suitable tool to help understand the 
segmentation stuff in Dylan.


OVERVIEW:

This view has 3 dependant subviews. The larger view is the bitmap view. This 
view represents each segment as a pixel with an associated colour representing 
the activity of the segment (black,white,gray,red). Note it might be necessary 
to change colours to allow the viewer to see the difference between checked and 
condemned software.

The Bar chard represents the current state of the memory segments accumulated 
together and the line chart shows how memory consumption has changed over time. 
Time in this context is considered to be beats driven by tracebegin/trace end 
events.


.problems. 

I'm told that it is possible to get multiple taces simultaneously. Harder to 
decode and assumed not to exist (for the moment).




TESTING:

This is what the system looks like currently.
