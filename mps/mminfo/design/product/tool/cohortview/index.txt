INTRODUCTION:

This is a more direct design response to meeting.general.1997-06-05(0). Which 
discussed the design of  tool's requirements as they relate to
improving the performance of the DylanWorks MM for the Sunflower release
(release.dylan.sunflower) see 


OVERVIEW:

'Scatter-diagram with Zone on the abscissa and Cohort on the ordinate'. Notice 
this will not 
inform the tool-user about how the MPS system is working over time just how it 
is working over the current frame (generational collection ????).

Each block represents an allocated segment in the arena, and  is coloured and 
put in the
appropriate box.

"Using this diagram, it might be possible to instantly see what the
condemned set is and how the remembered sets are working....Zone and Cohort 
will correlate strongly if the MM is doing its job well." to quote the meeting 
meeting.general.1997-06-05(0).

Judging from the meeting notes, I hadn't exactly envisaged a scatter diagram.  
More like an n x m lattice of boxes (where there are n Zones and m Cohorts 
say).  Each box would have a number of differently coloured segments in.  drj

REQUIREMENTS:

To do this the tool will need to be sent a number of events which described the 
state of each zone and Cohort.


IMPLEMENTATION:

Probably in Java.
