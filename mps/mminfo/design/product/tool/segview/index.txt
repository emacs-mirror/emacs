INTRODUCTION:

This is a special view dedicated to help MM internal programmers (David and 
Nick) to view the function of one of the generational collectors in Dylan. This 
view is not intended for external users (currently).


OVERVIEW:

This view displays segment location vertically ( with implicit segment size 
vertically too), against time. In this view time is generational time (with the 
pulse being sent from the MPS). The objective is to see how many segments are 
scanned and how many are eliminated.  Each segment is coloured by is't 
state,(live, scanned condemted see orginal meeting -> 
(meeting.general.1997-06-05(0)). 


Perhaps an overlay shows graphically the cumulative number of segments 
allocated/scanned/condemned etc.

This view should scale and scroll correctly in both directions.

.options.

Eliminating the size and allocation address might make the view more compact. 
The vertical axis would still be order correct (a about b means address of a > 
address of b).

.needs.

I need to have a guess for the number of segments - help me lay them out order 
of magnitude is enough.

There need to be some special segment events transmitted to the tool. see the 
meeting report.-> (meeting.general.1997-06-05(0)

NEW_SEGMENT_GENERATION -- used by timeing signal
SEGMENT_CONDEMEND      ADDRESS
SEGMENT_SCANNED        ADDRESS
SEGMENT_ALLOCATED      *ALREADY DONE*
SEGMENT_NOT_SCANNED    ADDRESS 
WIRED_DOWN     ADDRESS // don't know what this means 

possibly just have a 2 argument format.
SEGMENT_STATE          ADDRESS    enum{ SCANNED,CONDEMEND } 

is it reasonable to expect the negatives(if not scanned the == not scanned ) ?
