should look like data sheet
must tell which type of allocation protocol to use

(from RIT) properties that pool classes either have or don't have:

scanned
collected
objects may move
alloc + free interface
allocation point interface

From mail.drj.1997-10-10.09-12:

We should document the fact that not all pools usefully support
finalization of objects in that pool.

For starters only Automatic (ie garbage collected) pools have a chance,
and then it's up to the designer of the Pool Class to implement this
functionality (due to a restriction in the tracer design).  Pool
Classes AMC, LO, AWL all support finalization of their objects.

For other pools we should document the behaviour as being undefined for
now.  In future we should arrange to return an error if the client
attempts to finalize an object and the pool doesn't support it.  (The
actual behaviour of the MM, if say you registered an object allocated
from Pool Class MV for finalization, will be mostly harmless except
occasionally when it cause the MM to abort).
