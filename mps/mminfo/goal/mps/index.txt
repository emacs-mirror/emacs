individual projects: goal.epcore, goal.dylan, and goal.java.

and company management and MM developers.


History

.hist.0: Recorded by Pekka 2000-06-28, but implicit long before that.


GOALS

.support: Provide a framework to support (most of) the projects of the group.

.synergy: Provide a vehicle for utilizing improvements designed and implemented 
for one project into the others.

.promote: Promote the use of advanced MM techniques in all projects of the 
group, by making them cheaply available.

.extend: Provide a career path for the technology, by designing it to be 
generally useful and not just oriented towards the short-term needs of one 
client.  By extension, provide a career path for the people in the group.
