[Initial list written to provide focus for discussion -- GavinM 1996-11-04]

.waste: Reduce duplicate or wasted effort in the MM group.

.induct: Reduce cost of taking on new people in the MM group.

.global: Reduce costs of global development in the MM group. ["global 
development" probably means "truly distributed global development" (see a mouse 
mat).  drj 1998-10-01]

.scale: Enable growth of the MM group to result in corresponding increase in 
productivity.  [I'm still not sure this is sufficiently factored out from 
.induct and .global.  How about "Reduce the management resource require per 
capita"?]

.quality: Improve the quality of MM products.

.export: Improve process throughout Harlequin.

.risk: Reduce risk of other MM projects not meeting requirements. [How does 
this differ from .quality?]
