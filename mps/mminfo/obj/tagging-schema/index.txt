Tags are too long, and the tagging schemes in type.* are verbose.  There is 
also a risk of namespace clutter as time goes on.  We will be producing more 
and more tags for objectives, issues, etc. and the naming of these must deal 
with this.  Future issues, for example, may apply to the same areas of the 
project, and therefore demand similar tags.

1. Create a schema for tagging, which gives a way of working out a tagging 
scheme for any document type.  This can be part of proc.type, or perhaps form 
proc.tag and rule.tag.
2. Write up conventions for using tags.  When is it OK to use wildcards in 
references, and what do they mean?
3. Change the tags of existing documents if necessary during the following 
weekend.


REPORT:

.cover: A tagging scheme must be able to name all things in a certain domain.

.domain: The scheme must specify the domain of objects which it can name.

.dup: If part of the name is derivable from another part, omit one.

.word: Short, evocative, unambiguous English words should be used as name 
elements.

.canon: Two people provided with the scheme should produce the same name for 
the same thing in the scheme domain.

.relate: Names for related things should be related, and the relationship 
should be deducible from the names.

.ident: You should be able to tell what something is from its name.

.short: Names should be as short as possible (so that people are encouraged to 
use them).

.mem: Names must be memorable.

.retain: A thing should retain the same name over time.
