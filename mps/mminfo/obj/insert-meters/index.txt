1. Determine good places for initial metering points.  (Ask around.  Guess.)
2. Write up what you're going to meter.
3. Insert meters into code at these points.
4. Test.
5. Review results.

Issues
- How do you use a metered library?
- How are meters controlled?
- How do we use Explorer to view some results?


REPORT:

richard: We had a meeting to discuss this (meeting.general.1995-08-15).  We 
decided not to put meters in the actual release to the Dylan group, but instead 
to take their working code and link it with metered versions ourselves in order 
to do analysis.
