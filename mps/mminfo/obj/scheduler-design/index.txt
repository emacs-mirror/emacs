The scheduler will be reponsible for actually making collections happen once we 
go incremental.  At the moment, a collection happens within a call to the 
allocator.  The allocator should just allocate, and the scheduler should call 
the collection state-machine to make the collection happen.

The scheduler is part of the MPM, and should be independent of any particular 
pool implementation.  Having said that, it will be exclusively supporting the 
AMC pool as an incremental collector at first.  The design of the scheduler 
will therefore be closely tied in to the design of the AMC pool 
(obj.poolamc-design) and the tracing interface (obj.tracer-design).
