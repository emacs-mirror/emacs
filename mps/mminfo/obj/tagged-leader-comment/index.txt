> Subject: Leader comment conventions
>
> I've changed the convention for the formatting of the leader comment of
> source files to be more similar to the header style in the information
> system.
>
> Leader comments should now be of the form:
>
>   /*  <tag>
>    *
>    *              <TITLE IN UPPER CASE>
>    *
>    *  $HopeName$
>    *
>    *  Copyright (C) 1995 Harlequin Group, all rights reserved
>    *
>    *  <description, etc.>
>    */
>
> This is a minor change, but it makes sure that each file is marked with its
> tag, which is important.
>
> Note that the document type and status are _not_ included in the leader
> comment for the moment.  I have an idea to use the HOPE status keyword to
> do this.  For now, just leave them out.
>
> Implementation files are tagged impl.<type>.<name>, e.g. impl.h.vm (vm.h).
