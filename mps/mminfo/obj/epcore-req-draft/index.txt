We need a base requirements document reviewed and approvide by the relevant 
people in EP in order to start the design of the EP replacement memory manager 
and facilitate communication between MM and EP.  This document will change and 
evolve as the product is put together, but it will mean that the relationship 
and position is always fairly clear.

Using Gilb's suggested framework for attribute requirements (book.gilb88, 
book.gilb88.attr), put together a document which describes the requirements 
gathered during our meetings with Andy Cave and Luke Tumner 
(meeting.epcore.1995-07-18, etc.) and also taking into account the priorites 
and approved goals by Yoryos (meeting.epcore.1995-09-13).  The document should 
stand alone, so that it can be read and approved efficiently by various people 
in EP who will not know about the product.  No solutions should be implied.  
We'll review the document internally before releasing it.

A first draft should be ready in two weeks, although it would be good to review 
earlier drafts even sooner if you want.  (We could, for example, review the 
outline headings.)  This will be circulated between us, Andy, and Luke.  The 
next draft will go to a wider list of EP people, decided by Yoryos.

If you're feeling enthusiastic, an account of _how_ you produced the document 
would be useful.  Ideally, I'd like a procedure (proc.req) for generating 
requirements.
