We've been conducting informal review for some time.  Now we have an 
Information System, let's write down how they work and produce supporting 
stuff.  Then we should evolve towards the most effective method we can find, 
starting with Inspection.


REPORT:

There's a provisional review procedure in proc.review, and review notes are 
gradually going into review.*.  It's fairly rough at the moment, but it will 
do, and it's an improvement on our old system.
