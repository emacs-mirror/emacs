The merging of the Dylan groups and the installation of Andy Sizer as manger 
has thrown up a load of new requirements from the Dylan group.  Andy is 
attempting to get things together and prioritize tasks within the group, and 
this will affect our requirements.

Conduct a full review of the Dylan requirements document and attempt to:

  1. check functional requirements, add and delete if necessary
  2. place priorities and dates on functional requirement delivery
  3. check attribute requirements, add necessary requirements currently missing
  4. produce Dylan goals (goal.dylan)

Before meeting to discuss requirements, produce a list of questions that we 
need answered about requirements.  Read the book "Exploring Requirements: 
Quality before Design".
