Need to generate and analyse requirements.  Need to review current system.  
Design new one if need.  Document it.  Make sure group understands and agrees 
with it.


REPORT:

I had the idea that objectives could be determined at the weekly planning 
meeting, and could then be entered into the system.  Someone other than the 
person responsible for the objective could do this (such as the Librarian) 
which would reduce the overall burden.
