Our interface to the outside world (SpaceInit, PoolAllocP, etc.) isn't very 
well designed (or even defined).  We can't wait much longer before putting some 
thought into this interface, as it is becoming more and more exposed to 
DylanWorks.  I intend to expose it completely, and it is therefore important 
that it is considered carefully.

I've had some ideas about "generic allocation interfaces" which try to give an 
interface to a wider range of services from a pool: protection, useful 
mappings, etc. (idea.interface.alloc).

1. Investigate interface requirements and document in design.mps.interface.

2. Refine the ideas in idea.interface.alloc.

3. Design a schema for interfaces to memory managers, including generic 
prototypes for allocation, freeing, etc.

4. Use this schema to redesign the external interface of the memory manager.
