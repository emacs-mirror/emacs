WHAT ARE OUTSIDERS?
drj, 1995-10-27


A document to write down my thoughts on what outsiders will want out of the 
memory management information system.

Types of outsiders:

casual:  This person has heard about the Memory Management Group, is perhaps on 
mm-discussion, and wants to satisfy their curiosity about us.  They might want 
to know what sort of stuff we are doing and how we are going about doing it.  
They probably don't want lots of junk about what documents we reviewed and when 
and detailed analyses of of our code and so on.

heat-seeker:  This person has some specific problem or query and is approaching 
us with regards to a solution.  This might range from "have you read Moon's 
paper on generational GC?" to "Do you know anything about the ATOM toolkit?" to 
"Can you suggest a way to annotate stack frames to make them traceable".

client:  Clients are engaged in a constant discussion with us, in order that we 
can provide solutions for (some or all of) their memory management needs.  
Clients will want to have convenient access to documents relating to them.  
They may also fall into the casual class.

lead:  Someone who is assessing the group with regards to becoming a client.  
They will want to know how we can help them, how much it cost, and how quickly.

Their requirements:

casual: Will want an overview of the group and its projects, and an overview of 
the structure of the InfoSys, particular documents that have a low MM technical 
content.
req.group.overview
req.infosys.cattlefeed.overview

heat-seeker:  req.heat-seeker.resource: convenient access to those of the 
group's resources that are useful to outsiders (whatever they are).


client:  Will require some way of getting at all documents relevant to them.
req.client.pertain

lead:  Will require advertising.

Solutions:

client:
View>client>{epcore, dylan, etc} perhaps.
