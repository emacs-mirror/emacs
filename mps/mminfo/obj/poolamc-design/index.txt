The current AMC pool is clunky and difficult to adapt to incremental collection 
(or even something as simple as allocation buffers).  There are many 
requirements on the AMC pool from the Dylan project, but these have not been 
listed out carefully or analysed.

1. Analyse the requirements on the AMC pool.  Explicitly list the functional 
requirements and their derivations in particular: gray sets, incrementality, 
allocation, thread safety, etc.

2. Refine the solution ideas (smaller blocks, no generations, etc.)  I have 
some ideas which will significantly simplify it, which providing allocation 
buffers and a gray set implementation.  These have been pasted into 
design.mps.poolamc.

3. Analyse the solution ideas carefully w.r.t. the requirements.  Review this 
analysis with the team.

4. Produce a detailed design of the accepted and refined ideas.  Review this 
design.
