> This is how the Lisp team's daily HOPE checkin and checkout summary

> Our crontab is in:

>         colville:~misc/admin/admin/crontab
>
> * CHECKIN
>
> The checkin summary is created by:
>
>         colville:~misc/admin/admin/shells/report-all.sh # csh
>         (csh)
>
> This calls the basic checkin summarizer which is in:
>
>         colville:~misc/admin/hope/report.sh
>         (perl)
>
> The checkin summarizer does different work on different sites
> depending on the mastery of the compounds. It mails a daily summary to
> "lisp-hopers" and archives a monthly summary to a file.

> * CHECKOUT
>
> The checkout (or claim) summary is created by:
>
>         colville:~misc/admin/admin/shells/find-claims-all.sh
>         (csh)
>
> This calls the basic checkout summarizer which is in:
>
>         colville:~misc/admin/hope/find-claims.sh
>         (perl)
>
> It also does different work at different sites. It mails a daily
> summary to the group manager, to anyone who has a claim, and to a
> file. The claim reason is only displayed for recent claims.
