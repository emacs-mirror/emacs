Detailed design:
  - the collection process
  - general MM interface, including software barrier
  - software barrier, interaction with scheduling
  - MPM incremental support
    - scheduling
      - instrumentation of cost?
      - cost/benefit analysis?
      - simple?
    - Collection objects
    - collection IDs
    - greyness and grey set interface
  - new AMC pool
    - block-based structure
    - generations
    - requirements on Arena Manager
    - gray set implementation
    - weak/final reference implementation (general pointer ranks?)
    - buffered allocation
  - new Arena Manager to support AMC pool (not critical)
  - OS-specific hard-to-soft barrier conversion (fault handling)
  - thread safety policy

Implementation:
  - scheduler
  - collection objects
  - gray set interface
  - new AMC pool
  - new Arena Manager (if performance requires it)
  - fault handling for Windows NT and SunOS at least
  - software barrier

Acceptance tests:
  - pause times
  - space overheads
