During the tracing phase of collection (tag?) the state of the collection 
process consists mainly of the set of gray objects -- the object which have yet 
to be scanned.  With multiple concurrent collections, one collection might move 
an object which is in another collection's gray set.  It is important that this 
is done carefully so that all collections remain safe, and can terminate.

Each pool knows how best to represent a set of the objects is manages, so each 
pool must provide an abstract tracer interface which obeys certain properties.  
(By limiting the number of concurrent collections, the gray set can be 
efficiently stored adjacent to the object.  See tag?.)  This interface must 
obey certain properties.

This part of the system is very important to get right, and so deserves its own 
design documentation, with each property investigated and tagged.

1. Investigate the requirements (in particular the properties) that the tracer 
must meet.

2. List these, with analysis, in design.mps.tracer.req.

3. Generate ideas for an interface to the tracer suitable for any level of 
aggregation of objects, but in particular suitable for pools.

4. Evaluate the design ideas, choose the best one.  Review this decision with 
the team.

5. Produce detailed design of the chosen interface.
