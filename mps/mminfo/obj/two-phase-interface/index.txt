1. Produce design document tagged design.general.alloc.reserve "Two-phase 
allocation interface" describing the two-phase interface, Reserve/Commit etc.  
Go through mini-review.
2. Modify impl.dw.include.h.mm to export Reserve and Commit methods.
3. Modify impl.dw.src.c.dw to implement Reserve and Commit, and to check the 
object format on commit using the existing validation code.
4. Test the changes.  Review the modified code.
