Analyse the existing sources for three main purposes:

  1. Getting David to understand the system.
  2. Working out procedures for maintaining quality in future:
     a. support consistency by developing process and other conventions
     b. reduce defects by relating implementation to source documentation 
(design)
     c. ditto procedures
  3. Improve delegation in the project
     a. Document conventions and justify.
     b. Start process of improvement of conventions.
     c. Empowerment of project staff.

Produce notes on the analysis below.

Subject: Our source code and documentation

I have actually been introduced to the source code this week and I am
going to produce a report on it next week.  Does anyone have know of
any problems we have that I should examine, or have any comments to
make?

I am likely to say:

There are a lot of assumed conventions in the code.  We should
document them.

Too much is in the heads of the people who have written the code so far.  
We should write 'how-to' documentation.  For example on how to:
  Create a new source file
  Define a new function
  Port to a new architecture
  Create a new Pool
This might be as lightweight as a list of things to do.  This list
could also be used in inspections.

We should use tagging in the code to note:
  links to design/idea documentation
  dependencies on other bits of code
  assumptions
  use of particular conventions
  exceptions to a global convention

We should use tagging or some other mechanism to note incompleteness
or more generally that 'this' is not up to date with respect to 'that'.
