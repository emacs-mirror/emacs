We need a disk for deja-vu.  Deja-Vu is old rocannon.
Things to bear in mind:
Users home dirs: dsm, richard, drj, nickb, mm
software: gcc, lynx (for drj), gzip, gnumake, gas?, ctags, emacs.
will need to store traces and dumps (could be very large). 


REPORT:

Khalid has found a 600Mb disk.
The OS takes up about 350Mb (including "standard" software?).
jamesb is investingating prices of 1,2,4 Gb disks.
deja-vu is now sitting in the office at the House with an external 600Mb SCSI 
disk.  The disk is not terminated (funny connector); jamesb has ordered a 
terminator.  Neither deja-vu nor the disk have been switched on.
There is a slow 1Gb disk sitting in new rocannon at the moment.  Khalid wants 
to upgrade it to a newer bigger disk, and we will get the 1Gb disk.  This is 
fine for now.
