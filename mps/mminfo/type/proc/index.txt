Tag template: proc.<doctype>(.<name>)*


Tagging:

Procedures are tagged "proc.<doctype>.<name>" where <doctype> is the document 
type which is produced by the procedure, and <name> is a mnemonic name if 
necessary.
[Guidelines (which are not as rigid a procedures) are called 
proc.<doctype>.guide. This is obsolete. drj]


Purpose:

A procedure document describes a method for doing something;  it is a 
step-by-step form which can be followed by "running your finger down the page" 
in order to accomplish the task.  Procedure documents are improved over time so 
that they record the best known methods of achieving something.


Content:

The content of a procedure document is plain text.  The text should document 
the procedure step-by-step, and each step should be tagged (see 
guide.text.head.tag).


Procedures:

guide.text;proc.text.template
