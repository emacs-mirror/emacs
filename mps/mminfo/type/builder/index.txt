Rules: rule.universal

Tag template: builder.<code>


Tagging:

An builder document must be tagged using "builder.<code>" where <code> is a 
two-character "target code" as used by the build system (see 
guide.impl.c.naming, and [build system  doc]).


Purpose:

A document of type "builder" defines the "target code" of a "build environemtn" 
used in the build system [reference?] and stores information about the 
environment which is relevant to the project.

A build environment is a set of tool used to build memory management products 
on and for a particular platform.  An environment usually consists of a 
compiler, make tools, perhaps a debugger, profiler, etc.


Content:

The builder form contains these fields:

  PPSymbol: This is the preprocessor symbol which is defined on the compiler 
command
            line as part of the build function [reference?].  It is used in the
            source in conjunction with #ifdef to select code which is specific 
to
            the build environment (but, see guide.impl.c.pp.ifdef).

  NOTES: A place for general notes about the build environment.


Procedures:

proc.builder;proc.port
