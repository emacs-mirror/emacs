Tag template: obj.<area>.<type>.<deliv>(.<name>)*


Tagging:

Tags for objectives are determined hierarchically to fit in to the project
plan.  The form of the tag is "obj.<area>.<type>.<deliv>.<task>.<task>...",
where:
  area: of the project such as "dylan", "epcore", or "general",
  type: of requirement, such as "soft" for software or "support" for support,
  deliv: is the deliverable name, e.g. "alloc", "debug", "incr",
  task: hierarchically named task tags.


Purpose:

An objective is the end result of a task, and might be described as a
milestone.  Objectives are phrased in terms of end results, not activities.
For example, "Complete implementation of allocation buffers" is an
objective, whereas "Work on allocation buffers" is not.


Content:

The objective form describes who is responsible for the objective, and when
it is due to be completed.  There is also space for notes.  [In future, it
will contain other information -- richard]
