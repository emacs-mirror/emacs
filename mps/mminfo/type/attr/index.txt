Purpose:

An attribute requirement is a description of a constraint on the functionality 
that we must provide.  A constraint might be on resources, or a need for 
certain qualities in the product (speed, throughput, etc.).

The attr document type records an attribute requirement.

All attribute requirements are stated on measurable scales, with methods for 
testing satisfaction.  Attribute requirements are determined by negotiation 
with our clients.


Content:

Like functional requirements, attributes must be traceable, and they must be 
analysed.  The attr form has fields to help this.  [More detail required --
