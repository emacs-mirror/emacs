Tag template: urgency.<n>


Tagging:

Urgency levels are single digit codes.  Urgency documents must be tagged 
"urgency.<n>" where <n> is the digit.  Higher digits must define levels which 
are more urgent than lower ones.


Purpose:

An urgency definition document defines the meaning of an urgency level.  
Urgencies are used in objectives, issues, and elsewhere to define how soon the 
matter must be dealt with.


Content:

The urgency document should contain short description of what it means for 
something to be this urgent, and guidelines on when to use the level.
