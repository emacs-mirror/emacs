Rules: rule.universal

Tag template: platform.<os-code><arch-code><builder-code>


Tagging:

Platform documents must be tagged 
"platform.<os-code><arch-code><builder-code>", where these codes are the 
"target codes" of used by the build system (see guide.impl.c.naming, and 
design.buildsys).  Documents tagged os.<os-code>, arch.<arch-code>, and 
builder.<builder-code> should also exist to record information about the 
operating system, architecture, and build environment respectively.


Purpose:

A document of type platform defines a particular operating system/architecture/
build environment combination for which products are built.


Content:

The platform form is free-form text at the moment.  [Perhaps is should contain 
cross references to the releases produced for the platform, the clients for 
whom this platform is important, and other notes and experiences.  richard
