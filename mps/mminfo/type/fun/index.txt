Tag template: req.<client>.fun.<type>(.<name>)+


Tagging:

Functional requirements are tagged "req.<client>.fun.<type>.<name>....", where:
  client: is who we are supplying, such as "dylan", "epcore",
  type: sort of requirement, e.g. "soft", "support",
  name: er, there's not much of a scheme for these yet.


Purpose:

A functional requirement is a description of some functionality that the 
project must provide.  This could be software functionality, such as garbage 
collection, or group functionality, such as support.  Functional requirements 
are determined by negotiation with clients.


Content:

It is very important the the functional requirements are traceable.  We must 
know where they come from, and what their status is.  We also need to analyse 
them to determine unambiguously what they mean.  Each requirement should also 
have an analysis of its consequences.  The fun form includes fields to assist 
with this.
