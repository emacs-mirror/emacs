Tag template: importance.<n>


Tagging:

Importance levels are single digit codes.  Importance documents must be tagged 
"importance.<n>" where <n> is the digit.  Higher digits must define levels 
which are more important than lower ones.


Purpose:

An importance definition document defines the meaning of an importance level.  
Importance is used to categorize objectives, issues, and other documents.  
Importance is a measure of the total effect the document has, or potentially 
could have, on the project.


Content:

An importance definition should contain a short description of what it means 
for something to be this important, and guidelines on when to use the 
importance level.
