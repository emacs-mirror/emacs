Rules: rule.universal

Tag template: issue.<name>


Tagging:

Issue names should be mnemonic, unique, and resonably short.  The name 
shouldn't contain the entire description.  Choose something that we can use as 
a memorable hook for the problem.


Purpose:

A document of type "issue" records a problem or potential problem in the 
project.  Issues could be defects in requirements, solution ideas, design, or 
implementation.  Issues can also point out omissions or problems of a more 
vague nature.  The existence of an issue does not imply that the problem is 
real, or that any action is being taken about it, but issues _are_ processed as 
part of the development process.
