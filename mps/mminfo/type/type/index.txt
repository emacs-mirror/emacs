Tagging:

Document types are tagged "type.<code>", where code is the short string for the 
type.  It is important that this convention is used, because the implementation 
of the Information System may depend on it.


Purpose:

The "type" document type describes the purpose of a particular type of 
document.  [_This_ document is of type "type", since it describes the purpose 
of the document type "type".]

  Rules: The rules which apply to documents of the type.

  Procs: Procedures used to produce documents of the type.

               of the type.
