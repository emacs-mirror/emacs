Tagging:

A variety document must be tagged using "variety.<code>" where <code> is a 
two-character "target code" as used by the build system (see 
guide.impl.c.naming, and [build system doc]).


Purpose:

The "variety" document type describes a "target variety" for the build system.  
A target variety is a set of build parameters which control things such as 
source code annotations.  See design.mps.variety.
