Rules: rule.universal

Tag template: arch.<code>


Tagging:

An arch document must be tagged using "arch.<code>" where <code> is a 
two-character "target code" as used by the build system (see 
guide.impl.c.naming, and [build system doc]).


Purpose:

A document of type "arch" defines the "target code" of a processor architecture 
used in the build system [reference?] and stores information about the 
architecture which is relevant to the project.


Content:

The arch form contains these fields:

  PPSymbol: This is the preprocessor symbol which is defined on the compiler 
command
            line as part of the build function [reference?].  It is used in the
            source in conjunction with #ifdef to select code which is specific 
to
            the architecture (but, see guide.impl.c.pp.ifdef).

  ADDRWIDTH: This is the width of the address type for the architecture in bits.
             (e.g. 32 for SPARC, 64 for Alpha).

  ALIGNMOD: The minimum alignment of an address to allow access by any processor
            instruction.  This is expressed as a non-zero power of two.  (e.g. 8
            for a SPARC to allow access by the ldd instructions.)

  NOTES: A place for general notes about the architecture.


Procedures:

proc.arch;proc.port
