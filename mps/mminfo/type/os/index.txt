Rules: rule.universal

Tag template: os.<code>


Tagging:

An os document must be tagged using "os.<code>" where <code> is a two-character 
"target code" as used by the build system (see guide.impl.c.naming, and [build 
system doc]).


Purpose:

A document of type "os" defines the "target code" of an operating system or API 
used in the build system [reference?] and stores information about the OS which 
is relevant to the project.


Content:

The arch form contains these fields:

  PPSymbol: This is the preprocessor symbol which is defined on the compiler 
command
            line as part of the build function [reference?].  It is used in the
            source in conjunction with #ifdef to select code which is specific 
to
            the operating system (but, see guide.impl.c.pp.ifdef).

  NOTES: A place for general notes about the OS.


Procedures:

proc.os;proc.port
