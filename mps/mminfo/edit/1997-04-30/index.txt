PROCESS BRAINSTORM

.bs.start: 16:04

.bs: PTW: Trivial point.  Why is the tag of review.design.product.tool.0.  
GavinM: That's the revision of the product document.
PTW: Made it hard to find document using "[tag] =".  Are there manuals for 
Notes?
LMB: I'm sure mathew has some.

PTW: Another trivial one.  review document says "actio" in the help text.
[Fixed.  GavinM 1997-05-01]

Richard: PTW said last time that edit sessions worked by guilt and that wore 
off.
PTW: Guilt wore off first time for me.

LMB: Does any of your software engineering or product management reading talk 
about doing things about at certain times of day.
GavinM: [ A-Time and B-Time ... ]
Richard: That's why I don't do mail first thing.
