PROCESS BRAINSTORM

.process.start: 16:09

.process.notes: 

NickB: I deleted my working file.  File in edit for a long time.
GavinM: Because it was on the trunk.  Could have been branched.
NickB: If I could branch a unit, I would have done that.
GavinM: Would it ever be worth having a review branch?
DRJ: Sometimes.
NickB: Yeah.  Not worthwhile in this case.  Need to know that it was going to 
take this long.  Don't get around to edits often.  Edit sessions help to some 
extent.

DRJ: I always get surprised by 11 o'clock edit sessions.
GavinM: Would it help if I gave ten minutes warning?
DRJ: Maybe.
GavinM: Maybe I should send a timed v-mail.
DRJ: Female?
GavinM: _V_-mail.

AndrewS: Edit session seems to be about editting review document.  When I 
looked at the issue log, the notation used too a minute to figure out.  Perhaps 
they should have doc-links.
GavinM: It would be easy to add doc-links to the form.  These process documents 
are out of date; I should be able to make a plan for this in the next ten days.
AndrewS: I often get lost in the InfoSys.  It's almost perfect, much better 
than any other database.
DRJ: Try using view by keyword.

AndrewS: The fact that the edit section is in the same document means that I'm 
forced to print the document.
GavinM: Notes can open two windows on the same document.  We find printing much 
easier.
