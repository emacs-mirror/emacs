Brainstorm:
  DRJ: 
    - messing about with Hope
    - helping NickB
    - more done previously
  Richard:
    - Worked with GavinM
    - Distracted by RIT
    - First issue takes a lot of time
  NickB:
    - Don't know enough about MPS code to go ahead and edit it; need person 
looking over shoulder; lack of doc?
    - Distracted by RIT
  GavinM: 
    - Need to make changes after resolution
    - Too long since start of edit

  1. Underestimated consultation.  Wasn't unnecesssary.  Started late because 
fo GavinM and RIT.  Should start in morning.
  2. RIT's presence is bad for editing.  Avoid in future.
  3. Hope and Notes: getting more disk would help
  4. First issue takes long time: Decided a good design document was needed, 
and recusively.  After that progress will be more rapid.  Be careful with 
metrics.  Global shortage of design.  Don't know how to do it.  Not good to 
generate design from review of implementation.  Could stop code checkin or 
review without design.  Entry criterion of at least one source document?  Quite 
a good idea; try it.  No point in reviewing before more exits.  Edit sessions 
are good.  What about design sessions?  Explain and document.  Try this.
  5. Too long since start: Backlog; cost to edit increases with time.  Next day 
is best time.  Could have edit session the day after review.
