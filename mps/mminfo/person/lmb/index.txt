GOALS

To develop professionally
   Req: Improve technical knowledge
   Req: Expand writing experience
   Sol: Develop and publish process for documentation

To gain a sense of accomplishment
   Sol: Master highly technical information
   Sol: See the documentation through from start to release
   Sol: Win awards


ACTIONS

Finish documentation plan.

Learn C.

Obtain necessary software: latest version of MS Visual C++. 
(meeting.doc.1997-03-06)

Obtain necessary hardware: a CD-ROM drive. (meeting.doc.1997-03-06)

Obtain necessary books: Gilb, annotated ANSI C standard, thesaurus. 
(meeting.doc.1997-01-16.docissues, meeting.doc.1997-03-06, 
meeting.doc.1997-03-07.doc-proc)

Create time estimate and schedule, especially for counter-requirements. 
(meeting.doc.1997-03-10)

Sift through minutes and refine outlines.

Analyze stakeholders; refine goals; refine requirements and determine tests; 
determine anti-requirements. (meeting.doc.1997-02-06, 
meeting.doc.1997-03-11.goals)

Create low-level (chapter) designs for documentation (i.e., goals, 
requirements, and justifications).  (meeting.doc.1997-03-07.doc-proc)

Determine a process for writing, reviewing, and testing indexes. 
(meeting.doc.1997-03-07.doc-proc)

Determine a process for using Darwin and for evolutionary development 
(meeting.doc.1997-01-16.docissues, meeting.doc.1997-03-07.doc-proc)

Make plan of action based on March meetings.  (meeting.doc.1997-03-10)

Make list of counter-requirements. (meeting.doc.1997-03-10)

Develop templates for concepts, protocols, symbols, and the pool class 
catalog.  (meeting.doc.1997-01-16.docissues)

Determine fine points of text->Spring->Frame->people process. 
(meeting.doc.1997-03-12.doc-proc, meeting.doc.1997-03-12.doc.process)

Talk to Quartet about internationalization, legal issues, badging, binding.  
(meeting.doc.1997-03-06, meeting.doc.1997-03-06.prod-def)

Determine risks, esp. knock-on effects from interface and protocol changes, 
specialized documentation for internal customers. 
(meeting.doc.1997-03-07.doc-proc)

Determine a process for ensuring that the figures change when the software 
does.  (meeting.doc.1997-03-12.doc.figures.change)

Determine terminology.  (meeting.doc.1997-03-10)

Do competitive analysis of documentation.

Create policies for 
(a) documenting an interface in abstract vs. documenting how that interface 
actually appears in a specific language 
(protocol.mps.format.overview.capsule.comment) 
(b) documenting abstract/opaque/transparent/immediate/whatever types
(mail.gavinm.1997-10-10.12-42.1) and 
(c) documenting error codes (mail.gavinm.1997-10-10.12-42).

Put doc.ref-man.active-functions in alphabetical order 
(mail.drj.1997-10-14.09-04).

Make it clear what category each symbol falls into (see 
mail.drj.1997-10-10.11-22).

Determine how to set off symbols, variables, etc. in text (probably using 
display or single quotes).

Tidy up existing symbols.

Discuss responsibility for integrating comments into symbol/protocol docs, and 
whether I own them now, or MM does.


CONTINUING ACTIONS

Work on reference material.

Apply time tracking to my own work. (meeting.doc.1997-02-06)

Monitor MM Book.  (meeting.doc.1997-01-16.docissues)

Do background reading, especially design.mps.interface, meeting.qa.*, Richard 
Tucker's notes, and the procedure documentation for reviews and edits.

Comment on the design of the MPS, especially the user interface. 
(meeting.doc.1997-01-16.docissues)

Determine areas that need example code and estimate the effort involved.  
(meeting.doc.1997-01-16.doc-issues)

Read Quartet minutes.  (1997-03-06)

Write weekly plan.  (meeting.doc.1997-03-10)

Attend group meetings (?) and reviews.  (meeting.doc.1997-03-10)

Monitor the MM newsgroup.  (meeting.doc.1997-03-10)
