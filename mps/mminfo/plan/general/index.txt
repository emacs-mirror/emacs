GENERAL

.question: Is this useful? Would time ordering convey more information than 
grouping by product? 

.key: History (release in QA, or closed or abandoned) is shaded. Current work 
(release in development) filled. Vapourware (release waiting) outline.

.timescales: Where I really hadn't a clue, I ran end-dates to 1997-12-31.
