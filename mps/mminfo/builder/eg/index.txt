INTRODUCTION

.intro: This document describes the "eg" builder, which is based around the 
EGCS compiler.

.what: egcs is derived from gcc and is maintained by cygnus.  The website is 
http://egcs.cygnus.com/

.why: Apparently we need to use for an EP/Core release on the Linux OS.  See 
mail.dtb.1999-03-22.16-50(0).

.status: drj added eg.gmk and lii3eg.gmk (copied from the gcc files) on 
1999-03-23 and everything seemed to work, but I didn't modify mpstd.h.  I 
assume that egcs looks sufficiently like gcc that mpstd.h was fooled.  Still, 
we ought to look at this.
