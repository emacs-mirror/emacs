Pre-processor symbol: MPS_BUILD_AC


.what: This is used to mean some version of MrC when targetting PowerPCs and 
some version of SC when targetting 68ks.  Both of these are ANSI C compilers 
available from Apple.

.what.sc: SC is Symantec C.  It replaced MPW C on ETO #16 apparently (source, 
"Release Notes SC and SCpp v. 8.1.02", 
http://developer.apple.com/dev/tools/mpw-tools/relnotes/sc_8102_relnote.pdf).

.doc: Some information is available from the Apple compilers website:  <URL: 
http://developer.apple.com/dev/tools/mpw-tools/compilers/index.html>

.exact: Because this compiler is used mostly from an EP like development 
environment we're a bit more careful about what version of the compiler we're 
talking about.  .exact.mrc: Currently (1998-11-24) we use MrC version 2.0.2d1 
(see hope MMsrc!s7ppac:Makefile) (version 3 is available and various 
pre-releases of version 4 are available).  .exact.sc: We're not so precise with 
SC (see hope MMsrc!s760ac:Makefile).  The Makefiles just say "SC", so I guess 
it could be any version.

.environment: Both of these compilers form part of the MPW environment on the 
Macintosh.  SC is a 68K compiler but runs on PowerPC Macs (so you have to use a 
PowerPC mac to use it and cross-target).
