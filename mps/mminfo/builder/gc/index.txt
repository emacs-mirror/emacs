INTRODUCTION

.intro: This document describes the "gc" builder.


OVERVIEW

.components: GNU gcc (also used to drive the assembler) (traditionally we are 
loose about which version we mean.  As I write, 1998-11-06, we use 2.7.2 
mostly), GNU g++, GDB.

.doc: The "documentation" for the compiler is in texinfo format.  Best browsed 
using the info mode of emacs (M-x info); you'll want the gcc node (M-x 
Info-goto-node (gcc.info)).


FLAGS

.flags.debug: -ggdb3 means level 3 debugging info (most comprehensive) in gdb 
format.  This can be used even with optimization (but with less effect).  -g0 
means no debugging information.




WARNINGS

.warn.comma: GCC 2.7.2 warns if the LHS of a comma has no side-effect. Casting 
the LHS to void avoids this warning.
