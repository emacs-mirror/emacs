ABSTRACT:

It is difficult to achieve high performance while programming in the large.  In 
particular, maintaining locality hinders portability and modularity.  Existing 
methodologies are not sufficient: explicit communication and coding for 
locality require the programmer to violate encapsulation and compositionality 
of software modules, while automated compiler analysis remains unreliable. 

This thesis presents a performance model that makes thread and object locality 
explicit.  Zones form a runtime hierarchy that reflects the intended clustering 
of threads and objects, which are dynamically mapped onto hardware units such 
as processor clusters, pages, or cache lines.  This conceptual indirection 
allows programmers to reason in the abstract about locality without committing 
to the hardware of a specific memory system.  Zones complement conventional 
coding for locality and may be added to existing code to improve performance 
without affecting correctness. 

The integration of zones into the Sather language is described, including an 
implementation of memory management customized to parameters of the memory 
system.
