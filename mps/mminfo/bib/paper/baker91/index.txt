ABSTRACT:

Garbage collectors must minimize the scarce resources of cache space and 
off-chip communications bandwidth to optimize performance on modern single-chip 
computer architectures. Strategies for achieving these goals in the context of 
copying garbage collection are discussed. A multi-processor mutator/collector 
system is analyzed. Finally, the Intel 80860XP architecture is studied.
