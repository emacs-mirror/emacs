ABSTRACT:

[Not the abstract but clause 1]

1. Scope

This International Standard specifies the form and establishes the 
interpretation of programs written in the C programming language.  It specifies
- the representation of C programs;
- the syntax and constraints of the C language;
- the semantic rules for interpreting C programs;
- the representation of input data to be processed by C programs;
- the representation of output data produced by C programs;
- the restrictions and limits imposed by a conforming implementation of C.

This International Standard does not specify
- the mechanism by which C programs are transformed for use by a 
data-processing system;
- the mechanism by which C programs are invoked for use by a data-processing 
system;
- the mechanism by which input data are transformed for use by a C program;
- the mechanism by which output data are transformed after being produced by a 
C program;
- the size or complexity of a program and its data that will exceed the 
capacity of any specific data-processing system or the capacity of a particular 
processor;
- all minimal requirements of a data-processing system that is capable of 
supporting a conforming implementation.

REVIEWS:

As of writing (1999-03-03) this is the most recent complete committee draft of 
the standard.  The Portland meeting mades changes to this draft.  See also:
