ABSTRACT:

Garbage collector performance in LISP systems on custom hardware has been 
substantially improved by the adoption of lifetime-based garbage collection 
techniques.  To date, however, successful lifetime-based garbage collectors 
have required special-purpose hardware, or at least privileged access to data 
structures maintained by the virtual memory system.  I present here a 
lifetime-based garbage collector requiring no special-purpose hardware or 
virtual memory system support, and discuss its performance.
