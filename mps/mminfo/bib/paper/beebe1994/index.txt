ABSTRACT:

These notes for Mathematics computing courses describe the impact of memory and 
architecture on numerical performance on modern computers.

The memory hierarchy of registers, cache, main memory, and virtual memory is 
first described, and an excursion is made into RISC/CISC instruction set issues.

Performance bottlenecks arising at each of these memory levels are discussed 
and illustrated with numerical programming examples.

The text is augmented with numerous drawings and tables relevant to recent 
computers, from desktop microcomputers to the most advanced supercomputers.

I would recommend these notes to anyone who wants an introduction to the memory 
hierarchy of typical computers, related terminology, and related issues.  It 
also includes some comparison of RISC and CISC.

The notes are well written with lots of often informative diagrams and tables.  
The bulk of the notes are presented in Chapters 3 and 4.

Chapter 3 is a survey of the computer memory hierarchy (including the RISC/CISC 
discussion mentioned above).  This chapter is the best part of the notes, it's 
informative and well backed up with actual data and references.  It's thin on 
implementation details but that's fine for a survey.

Chapter 4 is an analysis of some memory bottlenecks and how you might avoid.  
The issues considered are narrowly confined to matrix operations (in fortran) 
which are covered fairly well.  There is nothing said about the problems you 
might encounter in other algorithms or systems or how to solve them.
