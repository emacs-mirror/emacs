ABSTRACT:

We present an algorithm that detects cycles of garbage in reference-based 
distributed systems. It is derived from Hughes' algorithm, in a simplified form 
that makes far fewer assumptions about the system. A local garbage collector 
marks incoming and outgoing references with timestamps that are propagated 
asynchronously between spaces. A central site computes the minimum reachable 
timestamp, allowing stale references to be identified and deleted. The 
coexistence of non-participating spaces, and spaces participating in 
collections controlled by more than one central site, is allowed.
