ABSTRACT:

We describe and prove the correctness of a new concurrent mark-and-sweep 
garbage collection algorithm.  This algorithm derives from the classical 
on-the-fly algorithm from Dijkstra et al.  A distinguishing feature of our 
algorithm is that it supports multiprocessor environments where the registers 
of running processes are not readily accessible, without imposing any overhead 
on the elementary operations of loading a register or reading or initializing a 
field.  Furthermore our collector never blocks running mutator processes except 
possibly on requests for free memory; in particular, updating a field or 
creating or marking or sweeping a heap object does not involve system-dependent 
synchronization primitives such as locks.  We also provide support for process 
creation and deletion, and for managing an extensible heap of variable-sized 
objects.
