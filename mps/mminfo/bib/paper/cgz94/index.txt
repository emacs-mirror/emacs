ABSTRACT:

Improving the performance of C programs has been a topic of great interest for 
many years.  Both hardware technology and compiler optimization research has 
been applied in an effort to make C programs execute faster.  In many 
application domains, the C++ language is replacing C as the programming 
language of choice.  In this paper, we measure the empirical behavior of a 
group of significant C and C++ programs and attempt to identify and quantify 
behavioral differences between them.  Our goal is to determine whether 
optimization technology that has been successful for C programs will also be 
successful in C++ programs.  We furthermore identify behavioral characteristics 
of C++ programs that suggest optimizations that should be applied in those 
programs.  Our results show that C++ programs exhibit behavior that is 
significantly different than C programs.  These results should be of interest 
to compiler writers and architecture designers who are designing systems to 
execute object-oriented programs.
