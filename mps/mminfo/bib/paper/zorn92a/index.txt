ABSTRACT:

Because dynamic memory management is an important part of a large class of 
computer programs, high-performance algorithms for dynamic memory management 
have been, and will continue to be, of considerable interest. We evaluate and 
compare models of the memory allocation behavior in actual programs and 
investigate how these models can be used to explore the performance of memory 
management algorithms. These models, if accurate enough, provide an attractive 
alternative to algorithm evaluation based on trace-driven simulation using 
actual traces. We explore a range of models of increasing complexity including 
models that have been used by other researchers. Based on our analysis, we draw 
three important conclusions. First, a very simple model, which generates a 
uniform distribution around the mean of observed values, is often quite 
accurate. Second, two new models we propose show greater accuracy than those 
previously described in the literature. Finally, none of the models 
investigated appear adequate for generating an operating system workload.
