ABSTRACT:

This report describes the the Second Annual Graph Drawing Contest, held in 
conjunction with the 1995 Graph Drawing Symposium in Passau, Germany. The 
purpose of the contest is to both monitor and challenge the current state of 
the art in graph-drawing technology. 

REVIEWS:

drj: This paper is a very brief summary of the 1995 Graph Drawing Contest
(held during Graph Drawing '95).  It says nothing about techniques, but
does have pretty pictures of the winning graphs.  I note the following:

Even graphs with just a few nodes can be hideously complicated.

The layout algorithm influences my impression of what the shape of the
graph is like.

Some of these graphs look really useful (in particular, there is a def
use graph for declarations in an X program).
