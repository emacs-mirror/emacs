ABSTRACT:

What is the Purpose of This Paper?

This paper provides a technical overview of the Capability Maturity Model for 
Software and reflects Version 1.1.  Specifically, this paper describes the 
process maturity framework of five maturity levels, the structural components 
that comprise the CMM, how the CMM is used in practice, and future directions 
of the CMM. This paper serves as one of the best sources for understanding the 
CMM, and it should clear up some of the misconceptions associated with software 
process maturity as advocated by the SEI.

The SEI has worked with industry and government to refine and expand the model, 
and software organizations are encouraged to focus on the CMM rather than on 
the maturity questionnaire. The SEI has developed, and is developing, a suite 
of process products to encourage this focus. This paper [Paulk93a], in 
combination with the "Key Practices of the Capability Maturity Model, Version 
1.1" [Paulk93b], comprises CMM v1.1. The "Key Practices of the Capability 
Maturity Model, Version 1.1" describes the key practices for each level of the 
CMM. This paper describes the principles underlying software process maturity 
and is intended to help software organizations use CMM v1.1 as a guide to 
improve the maturity of their software processes.
