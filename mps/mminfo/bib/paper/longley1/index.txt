ABSTRACT:

We will describe a general abstract framework for specifying and studying 
garbage collection strategies.  One of our aims is to make our framework as 
general as possible, in the hope that it might inspire the development of new 
GC strategies.  Our framework consists essentially of two parts: a 
_specification_ of the kind of behaviour a memory management system should 
deliver to the user, and a notion of implementation or _realization_ for such a 
specification.  We hope to show how several known GC strategies fit into our 
framework, and consider the kinds of questions that our framework allows us to 
address.
