ABSTRACT:

Exact garbage collection for the strongly-typed Java language may seem 
straightforward. Unfortunately, a single pair of bytecodes in the Java Virtual 
Machine instruction set presents an obstacle that has thus far not been 
discussed in the literature. We explain the problem, outline the space of 
possible solutions, and present a solution utilizing bytecode-preprocessing to 
enable exact garbage collection while maintaining compatibility with existing 
compiled Java class files.

REVIEWS:

Describes how to do stack maps for exact scanning of JVM stacks.  The only 
interesting part is how the get around the JSR/RET problem referred to in the 
abstract.  This problem is an idiosyncracy of the JVM.  pekka 1999-08-17
