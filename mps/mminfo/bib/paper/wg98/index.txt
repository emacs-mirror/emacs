ABSTRACT:

This document describes how to write a garbage collector (GC) for the EVM. It 
assumes that the reader
has a good understanding of garbage collection issues and some familiarity with 
the Java ™ language.

The EVM is part of a research project at Sun Labs. The interfaces described in 
this document are under
development and are guaranteed to change. In fact, the purpose of this document 
is to solicit feedback to
improve the interfaces described herein. As a result, specific product plans 
should not be based on this
document; everything is expected to change.

EVM, the Java virtual machine known previously as ExactVM, is embedded in Sun’s 
Java 2 SDK
Produc-tion Release for Solaris™, available at http://www.sun.com/solaris/java/.
