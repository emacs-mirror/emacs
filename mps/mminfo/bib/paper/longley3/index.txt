ABSTRACT:

This document describes an exercise in the use of the ML modules system to 
explain and clarify certain aspects of garbage collection algorithms.  The idea 
of this exercise is as follows: by examining a variety of existing GC 
algorithms, we identify features common to more than one of these algorithms, 
and to separate out aspects of GC that may be meaningfully considered in 
isolation from one another.  We then try to write ML "prototype 
implementations" of our algorithms, using the ML Modules system to express in a 
precise way these common features and these separated concerns. We thus obtain 
ML programs built out of modular pieces, which we can then recombine in 
different ways to obtain new "garbage collectors". In this way we can give some 
formal justification for the claim that the concerns we have separated out are 
indeed "independent".
