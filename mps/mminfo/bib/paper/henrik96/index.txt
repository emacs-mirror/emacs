ABSTRACT:

Incremental algorithms are often used to interleave the work of a garbage 
collector with the execution of an application program, the intention being to 
avoid long pauses. However, overestimating the worst-case storage needs of the 
program often causes all the garbage collection work to be performed in the 
beginning of the garbage collection cycles, slowing down the application 
program to an unwanted degree. This paper explores an approach to distributing 
the work more evenly over the garbage collection cycle.
