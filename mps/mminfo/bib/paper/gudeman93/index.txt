ABSTRACT:

This report is a discussion of various techniques for representing type 
information in dynamically typed languages, as implemented on general-purpose 
machines (and costs are discussed in terms of modern RISC machines). It is 
intended to make readily available a large body of knowledge that currently has 
to be absorbed piecemeal from the literature or re-invented by each language 
implementor. This discussion covers not only tagging schemes but other forms of 
representation as well, although the discussion is strictly limited to the 
representation of type information. It should also be noted that this report 
does not purport to contain a survey of the relevant literature. Instead, this 
report gathers together a body of folklore, organizes it into a logical 
structure, makes some generalizations, and then discusses the results in terms 
of modern hardware.
