ABSTRACT:

We describe the design, implementation, and use of a new kind of profiling tool 
that yields valuable information about the memory use of lazy functional 
programs.  The tool has two parts: a modified functional language 
implementation which generated profiling implementation during the execution of 
programs, and a separate program which converts this information to graphical 
form.  With the aid of profile graphs, one can make alterations to a functional 
program which dramatically reduce its space consumption.  We demonstrate that 
this is the case of a genuine example -- the first to which the tool has been 
applied -- for which the results are strikingly successful.
