ABSTRACT:

Dynamic storage allocation is an important part of a large class of computer 
programs written in C and C++. High-performance algorithms for dynamic storage 
allocation have been, and will continue to be, of considerable interest. This 
paper presents detailed measurements of the cost of dynamic storage allocation 
in 11 diverse C and C++ programs using five very different dynamic storage 
allocation implementations, including a conservative garbage collection 
algorithm. Four of the allocator implementations measured are 
publicly-available on the Internet. A number of the programs used in these 
measurements are also available on the Internet to facilitate further research 
in dynamic storage allocation. Finally, the data presented in this paper is an 
abbreviated version of more extensive statistics that are also 
publicly-available on the Internet.
