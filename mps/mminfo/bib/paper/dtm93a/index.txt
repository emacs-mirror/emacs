ABSTRACT:

Heap allocation with copying garbage collection is believed to have poor memory 
subsystem performance. We conducted a study of the memory subsystem performance 
of heap allocation for memory subsystems found on many machines. We found that 
many machines support heap allocation poorly. However, with the appropriate 
memory subsystem organization, heap allocation can have good memory subsystem 
performance.
