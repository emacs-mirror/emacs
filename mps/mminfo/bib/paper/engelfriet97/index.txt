ABSTRACT:

According to some of the search engines, there are now over thirty million 
documents on the Web.  This means that almost every topic is covered in many 
locations.  If a document is hard to read, or the information therein is hard 
to find, chances are your reader will go elsewhere instead.  That's why it is 
important to make documents accessible to everyone.  This style guide will 
hopefully help you write easy to read documents.
