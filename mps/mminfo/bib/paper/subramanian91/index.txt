ABSTRACT:

We have designed and implemented an external pager that: (1) received 
information regarding discardability of pages from the client such as a garbage 
collector for functional programming languages, (2) saves and restores only 
non-discardable pages and (3) influences page-replacement by pre-flushing 
discardable pages. In a general purpose operating system dirty pages are 
typically saved to disk and then restored from disk even when the application 
may not care about the contents of those pages. For example, copying garbage 
collection used in functional programming languages generates many pages that 
are dirty but discardable. Using the external pager to manage the discardable 
pages we observed that elapsed times for some applications decreased by as much 
as a factor of 6.
