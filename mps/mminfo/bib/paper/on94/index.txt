ABSTRACT:

We have implemented a concurrent copying garbage collector that uses 
replicating garbage collection. In our design, the client can continuously 
access the heap during garbage collection. No low-level synchronization between 
the client and the garbage collector is required on individual object 
operations. The garbage collector replicates live heap objects and periodically 
synchronizes with the client to obtain the client's current root set and 
mutation log. An experimental implementation using the Standard ML of New 
Jersey system on a shared-memory multiprocessor demonstrates excellent pause 
time performance and moderate execution time speedups.

REVIEWS:

nickb: This is (finally) what replication is really good for: doing GC 
concurrently with no VM support.
