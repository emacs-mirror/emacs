ABSTRACT:

Generation-based garbage collection has been advocated by appealing to the 
intuitive but vague notion that "young objects are more likely to die than old 
objects".  The intuition is, that if a generation-based garbage collection 
scheme focuses its effort on scanning recently created objects, then its 
scanning efforts will pay off more in the form of more recovered garbage, than 
if it scanned older objects.  In this note, we show a counterexample of a 
system in which "infant mortality" is as high as you please, but for which 
generational garbage collection is ineffective for improving the average 
mark/cons ratio.  Other benefits, such as better locality and a smaller number 
of large delays, may still make generational garbage collection attractive for 
such a system, however.
