ABSTRACT:

We present an implementation of the Train Algorithm, an incremental collection 
scheme for reclamation of mature garbage in generation-based memory management 
systems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first Train Algorithm 
implementation ever. Using the algorithm, the traditional mark-sweep garbage 
collector employed by the Mjølner run-time system for the object-oriented BETA 
programming language was replaced by a non-disruptive one, with only negligible 
time and storage overheads.
