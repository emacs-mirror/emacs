ABSTRACT:

This paper presents the results of a simulation-based study of various
translation lookaside buffer (TLB) architectures, in the context of a
modern VLSI RISC processor.  The simulators used address traces,
generated by instrumented versions of the SPECmarks and several other
programs running on a DECstation 5000.  The performance of two-level
TLBs and fully-associative TLBs were investigated.  The amount of
memory mapped was found to be the dominant factor in TLB performance.
Small first-level FIFO instruction TLBs can be effective in two level
TLB configurations.  For some applications, the cycles-per-instruction
(CPI) loss due to TLB misses can be reduced from as much as 5 CPI to
negligible levels with typical TLB parameters through the use of
variable-sized pages.
