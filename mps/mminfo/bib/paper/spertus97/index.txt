ABSTRACT:

C++ and Garbage Collection 

Dr. Dobb's Journal December 1997 

Not your father's garbage collection

By Mike Spertus

Mike is the author and chief designer of the commercial Great Circle garbage 
collector for C/C++. He can be reached at mps@geodesic.com. 


Memory management in C/C++ is both time consuming and error prone. Typically, 
about one-third of development time is spent on memory management, and most 
commercially available programs ship
with memory leaks or premature frees. Even worse, no matter how well written 
your own code is, third-party libraries and DLLs used by your program may leak, 
leaving you with no way to deliver
leak-free applications.

Imagine what would happen if memory just freed itself when it was no longer in 
use. Programs that freed memory in the wrong place would automatically be 
fixed, and new code wouldn't need to free
memory at all. Such automatic garbage collection is the standard in Java and 
Smalltalk. In this article, I'll lift the hood on the commercially available 
Great Circle garbage collector (from Geodesic Systems,
the company I work for), focusing on the details that make it practical, 
transparent, and scalable.
