ABSTRACT:

Stop-and-copy garbage collection has been preferred to mark-and-sweep 
collection in the last decade because its collection time is proportional to 
the size of reachable data and not to the memory size. This paper compares the 
CPU overhead and the memory requirements of the two collection algorithms 
extended with generations, and finds that mark-and-sweep collection requires at 
most a small amount of additional CPU overhead (3-6%) but requires an average 
of 20% (and up to 40%) less memory to achieve the same page fault rate. The 
comparison is based on results obtained using trace-driven simulation with 
large Common Lisp programs.
