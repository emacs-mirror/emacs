ABSTRACT:

[from the introduction]

Search trees are an efficient method for representing a set of elements (each 
with a key from a totally ordered universe) such that many operations dealing 
with the order of the keuys in the set can be carried out efficiently. These 
are operations such as: insert, delete, predecessor, successor, rank, findmax, 
findmin, deletemax, deletemin, searchrange, and many others. This note 
describes a very simple and efficient way to do these things.
