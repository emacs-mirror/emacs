ABSTRACT:

We present static and dynamic semantics for an abstract machine that evaluates 
expressions of a polymorphic programming language.  Unlike traditional 
semantics, our abstract machine exposes many important issues of memory 
management, such as value sharing and control representation.  We prove the 
soundness of the static semantics with respect to the dynamic semantics using 
traditional techniques.  We then show how these same techniques may be used to 
establish the soundness of various memory management strategies, including 
type-based, tag-free garbage collection; tail-call elimination; and environment 
strengthening.
