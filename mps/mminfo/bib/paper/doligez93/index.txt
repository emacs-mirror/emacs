ABSTRACT:

This paper presents the design and implementation of a "quasi real-time" 
garbage collector for Concurrent Caml Light, an implementation of ML with 
threads.  This two-generation system combines a fast, asynchronous copying 
collector on the young generation with a non-disruptive concurrent marking 
collector on the old generation.  This design crucially relies on the ML 
compile-time distinction between mutable and immutable objects.
