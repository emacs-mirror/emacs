ABSTRACT:

We study the cost of storage management for garbage-collected programs compiled 
with the Standard ML of New Jersey compiler. We show that the cost of storage 
management is not the same as the time spent garbage collecting. For many of 
the programs, the time spent garbage collecting is less than the time spent 
doing other storage-management tasks.

REVIEWS:

nickb: Using QPT and Tycho, they count the cost of instructions executed for a 
set of operations related to memory management: GC phases, allocation, tagging, 
write barrier, using position independent code. The total cost is  20-50% of 
runtime, where GC time is 6-30% of runtime. They also measure a bunch of 
related things, like the change in cache miss rates after a GC (when things 
have moved).
