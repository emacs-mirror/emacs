ABSTRACT:

Overview

This package contains a copy of the software process maturity questionnaire. It 
is intended for those interested in performing and learning about software 
process appraisals. This version differs in several important ways from its 
predecessor, A Method for Assessing the Software Capability of Contractors 
(CMU/SEI-87-TR-23). The most important difference is that this questionnaire is 
not an appraisal method itself; rather, it is one component that is used in 
different appraisal methods.
