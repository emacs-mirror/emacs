REVIEWS:

This early paper presents a sort of an copying collector, in that it builds a 
representation of all the live data in secondary storage (a drum, in those 
days), and then reads it in, achieving compaction and implicit freeing.  This 
makes sense if the system is short of primary storage and the speed difference 
is not large -- neither of which is true today.

The algorithm is presented in Lisp, using the justly forgotten M-expression 
notation, and an archaic style.
