ABSTRACT:

We propose adding safe, efficient garbage collection to C++, eliminating the 
possibility of storage-management bugs and making the design of complex, 
object-oriented systems much easier. This can be accomplished with almost no 
change to the language itself and only small changes to existing 
implementations, while retaining compatibility with existing class libraries.
