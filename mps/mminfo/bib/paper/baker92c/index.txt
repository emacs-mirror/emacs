ABSTRACT:

A simple real-time garbage collection algorithm is presented which does not 
copy, thereby avoiding some of the problems caused by the asynchronous motion 
of objects.  This in-place "treadmill" garbage collection scheme has 
approximately the same complexity as other non-moving garbage collectors, thus 
making it usable in a high-level language implementation where some pointers 
cannot be traced.  The treadmill is currently being used in a Lisp system built 
in Ada.
