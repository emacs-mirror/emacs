ABSTRACT:

This paper investigates the performance of 35 dynamic memory allocation 
algorithms when used to service simulation programs as represented by 18 test 
cases.  Algorithm performance was measured in terms of processing time, memory 
usage, and external memory fragmentation.  Algorithms maintaining separate free 
space lists for each size of memory block used tended to perform quite well 
compared with other algorithms.  Simple algorithms operating on memory ordered 
lists (without any free list) performed surprisingly well.  Algorithms 
employing power-of-two block sizes
had favorable processing requirements but generally unfavorable memory usage.  
Algorithms employing LIFO, FIFO, or memory ordered free lists generally 
performed poorly compared with others.

REVIEWS:

David Chase from mail.ptw.1995-08-14.16-44:
Furthermore, even if you have to write a memory allocator, very reasonable 
advice on how-to was given as long ago as 1977, and allocators designed 
according to that advice are still among the best available (Norman Nielsen, 
"Dynamic Memory Allocation in Computer Simulation", CACM 20:11, November, 
1977).  This paper was no big secret -- I remember being pointed to it in a 
graduate-level OS principles class when I was an undergraduate.  It was in that 
same class that the badness of roving-fit (and why) were first described to me 
as well, so, again, this was not a big secret either.
