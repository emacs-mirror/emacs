ABSTRACT:

Dynamic memory allocation has been a fundamental part of most computer systems 
since roughly 1960, and memory allocation is widely considered to be either a 
solved problem or an insoluble one.  In this survey, we describe a variety of 
memory allocator designs and point out issues relevant to their design and 
evaluation.  We then chronologically survey most of the literature on 
allocators between 1961 and 1995.  (Scores of papers are discussed, in varying 
detail, and over 150 references are given.)

We argue that allocator designs have been unduly restricted by an emphasis on 
mechanism, rather than policy, while the latter is more important; higher-level 
strategic issues are still more important, but have not been given much 
attention.

Most theoretical analyses and empirical allocator evaluations to date have 
relied on very strong assumptions of randomness and independence, but real 
program behavior exhibits important regularities that must be exploited if 
allocators are to perform well in practice.
