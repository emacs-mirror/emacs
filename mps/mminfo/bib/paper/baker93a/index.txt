ABSTRACT:

We argue that intensional object identity in object-oriented programming 
languages and databases is best defined operationally by side-effect semantics. 
A corollary is that "functional" objects have extensional semantics. This model 
of object identity, which is analogous to the normal forms of relational 
algebra, provides cleaner semantics for the value-transmission operations and 
built-in primitive equality predicate of a programming language, and eliminates 
the confusion surrounding "call-by-value" and "call-by-reference" as well as 
the confusion of multiple equality predicates.

Implementation issues are discussed, and this model is shown to have 
significant performance advantages in persistent, parallel, distributed and 
multilingual processing environments. This model also provides insight into the 
"type equivalence" problem of Algol-68, Pascal and Ada.

REVIEWS:

  This is an insightful paper that cuts through the confusion surrounding the 
multiple concepts of object identity, and shows how they relate to each other 
and which ones make sense.
  Section 3.I discusses optimizations to copying GC made possible by an 
appropriate view of object identity.
