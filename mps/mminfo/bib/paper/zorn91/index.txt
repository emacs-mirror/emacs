ABSTRACT:

Cache performance is an important part of total performance in modern computer 
systems. This paper describes the use of trace-driven simulation to estimate 
the effect of garbage collection algorithms on cache performance. Traces from 
four large Common Lisp programs have been collected and analyzed with an 
all-associativity cache simulator. While previous work has focused on the 
effect of garbage collection on page reference locality, this evaluation 
unambiguously shows that garbage collection algorithms can have a profound 
effect on cache performance as well. On processors with a direct-mapped cache, 
a generation stop-and-copy algorithm exhibits a miss rate up to four times 
higher than a comparable generation mark-and-sweep algorithm. Furthermore, 
two-way set-associative caches are shown to reduce the miss rate in 
stop-and-copy algorithms often by a factor of two and sometimes by a factor of 
almost five over direct-mapped caches. As processor speeds increase, cache 
performance will play an increasing role in total performance. These results 
suggest that garbage collection algorithms will play an important part in 
improving that performance.
