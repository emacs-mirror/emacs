ABSTRACT:

As processor speeds continue to improve relative to main-memory access
times, cache performance is becoming an increasingly important component
of program performance. Prior work on the cache performance of
garbage-collected methods either argues or assumes that conventional
garbage-collection methods will yield poor performance, and has
therefore concentrated on new collection algorithms designed
specifically to improve cache-level reference locality. 

This paper argues to the contrary: Many programs written in
garbage-collected methods are naturally well-suited to the direct-mapped
caches typically found in modern computer systems. Garbage-collected
programs written in a mostly-functional style should perform well when a
simple linear storage allocation and an infrequently-run generational
compacting collector are employed: sophisticated collectors intended to
improve cache performance are unlikely to be necessary. As locality
becomes ever more important to program performance, programs of this
kind may turn out to have significant performance advantages over
programs written in traditional languages.

REVIEWS:

drj: I've had a quick flick through and it looks like it is just a shorter 
version of his PhD (paper.reinhold93); same data, same diagrams, same 
conclusions, etc.
