ABSTRACT:

The automatic reclamation of storage for unreferenced objects is very important 
in object databases. Existing language system algorithms for automatic storage 
reclamation have been shown to be inappropriate.  In this paper, we investigate 
methods to improve the performance of algorithms for automatic storage 
reclamation of object databases.  These algorithms are based on a technique 
called partitioned garbage collection, in which a subset of the entire database 
is collected independently of the rest.  Specifically, we investigate the 
policy that is used to select what partition in the database should be 
collected.  The new partition selection policies that we propose and 
investigate are based on the intuition that the values of overwritten pointers 
provide good hints about where to find garbage.  Using trace-driven simulation, 
we show that one of our policies requires less I/O to collect more garbage than 
any existing implementable policy and performs close to an 
impractical-to-implement but near-optimal policy over a wide range of database 
sizes and connectivities.
