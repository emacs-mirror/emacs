ABSTRACT:

The "mostly-copying" garbage collection algorithm provides a way to perform 
compacting garbage collection in spite of the presence of ambiguous pointers in 
the root set. As originally defined, each collection required almost all 
accessible objects to be moved. While adequate for many applications, programs 
that retained a large amount of storage spent a significant amount of time 
garbage collecting. To improve performance of these applications, a 
generational version of the algorithm has been designed. This note reports on 
this extension of the algorithm, and its application in collectors for Scheme 
and C++.
