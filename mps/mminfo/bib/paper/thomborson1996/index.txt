Subject: [gclist] Fractal nature of memory hierarchies

I just came across an interesting paper while browsing the net:

"When Virtual Memory isn't Enough"

This person isn't really a gc person, but he has done a lot of work
with very large numerical calculations, and has hassled the memory
management of a Postscript implementation which must be able to handle
huge multicolor images.

He comes up with a fractal model for the various parameters of a
memory system and how they scale, so that one can write 'portable'
programs that bang the various levels of the hierarchy pretty good.
