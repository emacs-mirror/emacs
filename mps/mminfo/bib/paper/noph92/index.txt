ABSTRACT:

We introduce a new replication-based copying garbage collection technique. We 
have implemented one simple variation of this method to provide incremental 
garbage collection on stock hardware with no special operating system or 
virtual memory support. The performance of the prototype implementation is 
excellent: major garbage collection pauses are completely eliminated with only 
a slight increase in minor collection pause times.

Unlike the standard copying algorithm, the replication-based method does not 
destroy the original replica when a copy is created. Instead, multiple copies 
may exist, and various standard strategies for maintaining consistency may be 
applied. In our implementation for Standard ML of New Jersey, the mutator 
continues to use the from-space replicas until the collector has achieved a 
consistent replica of all live data in to-space.

We present a design for a concurrent garbage collector using the 
replication-based technique. We also expect replication-based GC methods to be 
useful in providing services for persistence and distribution, and briefly 
discuss these possibilities.

REVIEWS:

nickb: The original paper on replication GC, and my only published GC paper. 
Describes the technique, and gives a few numbers for an SML/NJ implementation. 
The later replication papers (paper.no93, paper,no93a, paper.on94) are more 
sophisticated.
