ABSTRACT:

We will describe a general abstract framework for specifying and studying 
garbage collection strategies.  Our primary aim is to provide a foundation for 
reasoning mathematically about aspects of GC algorithms and their correctness.  
We also hope that the framework itself might inspire the development of new GC 
strategies.

The framework we present is intended to allow one to describe complex 
real-world MM systems at a variety of levels of abstraction, ranging from very 
abstract _specifications_ of the desired behaviour through to fairly concrete 
_implementations_. In particular, our framework will allow one to give multiple 
descriptions of the same system at different levels of memory organization, 
together with an account of the relationships between these levels.

Here we present the bare bones of our framework, and consider the kinds of 
question that it helps us to address.
Many of the initial ideas came from discussions with Rod Burstall; the present 
version has also benefited greatly from discussions with Richard Brooksby and 
David Jones.  Eventually we also hope to show how known GC strategies 
can successfully be described within our framework.
