ABSTRACT:

Locality of reference is crucial to the performance of
modern computers, but is actually poorly understood.
In this paper, we survey issues in locality and memory
hierarchy design, attempting to bring together what
is known, correct common misconceptions, and clarify
what is not known.

We present a unified approach to locality, based on
the concept of timescale relativity, which simply says
that some patterns in program behavior are relevant
to issues of caching, and others are not, and that the
difference depends crucially on the timescale relevant
to a particular cache.

Memory hierarchies use a kind of online, adaptive
algorithm to control caching; such algorithms cannot
be studied properly without some understanding of
the regularities in the "data" (program behavior) they
must process.

We attempt a vertical unification, showing that
locality of reference results from regularities in the 
structure of programs, and from regularities in how memory
allocators map program objects onto virtual address
space.
