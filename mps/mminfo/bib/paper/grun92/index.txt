ABSTRACT:

The allocation and disposal of memory is a ubiquitous operation in most 
programs. Rarely do programmers concern themselves with details of memory 
allocators; most assume that memory allocators provided by the system perform 
well. Yet, in some applications, programmers use domain-specific knowledge in 
an attempt to improve the speed or memory utilization of memory allocators. In 
this paper, we describe a program (CustoMalloc) that synthesizes a memory 
allocator customized for a specific application. Our experiments show that the 
synthesized allocators are uniformly faster than the common binary-buddy (BSD) 
allocator, and are more space efficient. Constructing a custom allocator 
requires little programmer effort. The process can usually be accomplished in a 
few minutes, and yields results superior even to domain-specific allocators 
designed by programmers. Our measurements show the synthesized allocators are 
from two to ten times faster than widely used allocators.
