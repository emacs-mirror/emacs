ABSTRACT:

Scalar functions of three variables, w = f(x,y,z), are common in many
types of scientific and medical applications.  Such 3D scalar fields can
be understood as elevation maps in four dimensions, with three
independent variables (x, y, z) and a fourth, dependent, variable w that
corresponds to the elevations.  We show how techniques developed originally
for the display of 3-manifolds in 4D Euclidean space can be adapted to
visualize 3D scalar fields in a variety of ways.
