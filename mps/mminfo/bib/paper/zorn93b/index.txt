ABSTRACT:

Dynamic storage allocation is used heavily in many application areas including 
interpreters, simulators, optimizers, and translators. We describe research 
that can improve all aspects of the performance of dynamic storage allocation 
by predicting the lifetimes of short-lived objects when they are allocated. 
Using five significant, allocation-intensive C programs, we show that a great 
fraction of all bytes allocated are short-lived (> 90% in all cases). 
Furthermore, we describe an algorithm for lifetime prediction that accurately 
predicts the lifetimes of 42-99% of all objects allocated. We describe and 
simulate a storage allocator that takes advantage of lifetime prediction of 
short-lived objects and show that it can significantly improve a program's 
memory overhead and reference locality, and even, at times, improve CPU 
performance as well.
