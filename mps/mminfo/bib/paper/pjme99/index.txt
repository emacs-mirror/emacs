ABSTRACT:

Every now and then, a user of the Glasgow Haskell Compiler asks for a feature 
that requires specialised support from the storage manager.  Memo functions, 
pointer equality, external pointers, finalizers, and weak pointers, are all 
examples. 

We take memo functions as our exemplar because they turn out to be the 
trickiest to support.  We present no fewer than four distinct mechanisms that 
are needed to support memo tables, and that (in various combinations) satisfy a 
variety of other needs. 

The resulting set of primitives is undoubtedly powerful and useful. Whether 
they are too powerful is not yet clear.  While the focus of our discussion is 
on Haskell, there is nothing Haskell-specific about most of the primitives, 
which could readily be used in other settings.
