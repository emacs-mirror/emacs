ABSTRACT:

This paper presents a classification of barrier techniques for interleaving 
tracing with mutator operation during an incremental garbage collection.  The 
two useful tricolour invariants are derived from more elementary considerations 
of graph traversal.  Barrier techniques for maintaining these invariants are 
classified according to the action taken at the barrier (such as scanning an 
object or changing its colour), and it is shown that the algorithms described 
in the literature cover all the possibilities except one.  Unfortunately, the 
new technique is impractical.  Ways of combining barrier techniques are also 
discussed.
