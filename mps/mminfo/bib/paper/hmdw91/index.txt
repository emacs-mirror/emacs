ABSTRACT:

We describe a memory management toolkit for language implementors. It offers 
efficient and flexible generation scavenging garbage collection. In addition to 
providing a core of language-independent algorithms and data structures, the 
toolkit includes auxiliary components that ease implementation of garbage 
collection for programming languages. We have detailed designs for Smalltalk 
and Modula-3 and are confident the toolkit can be used with a wide variety of 
languages. The toolkit approach is itself novel, and our design includes a 
number of additional innovations in flexibility, efficiency, accuracy, and 
cooperation between the compiler and the collector.
