ABSTRACT:

We survey basic garbage collection algorithms, and variations such as 
incremental and generational collection; we then discuss low-level 
implementation considerations and the relationships between storage management 
systems, languages, and compilers.  Throughout, we attempt to present a unified 
view based on abstract traversal strategies, addressing issues of conservatism, 
opportunism, and immediacy of reclamation; we also point out a variety of 
implementation details that are likely to have a significant impact on 
performance.
