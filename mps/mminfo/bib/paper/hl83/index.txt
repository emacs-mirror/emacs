ABSTRACT:

In previous heap storage systems, the cost of creating objects and garbage 
collection is independent of the lifetime of the object. Since objects with 
short lifetimes account for a large portion of storage use, it is worth 
optimizing a garbage collector to reclaim storage for these objects more 
quickly. The garbage collector should spend proportionately less effort 
reclaiming objects with longer lifetimes. We present a garbage collection 
algorithm that (1) makes storage for short- lived objects cheaper than storage 
for long- lived objects, (2) that operates in real-time--object creation and 
access times are bounded, (3) increases locality of reference, for better 
virtual memory performance, (4) works well with multiple processors and a large 
address space.
