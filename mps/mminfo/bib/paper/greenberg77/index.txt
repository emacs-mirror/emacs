ABSTRACT:

To those LISPmen who have achieved proficiency in this our chosen
     language, and who have wondered about the strategies of the MACLISP
     compilers, I offer this tutorial, wherein I divulge the basic hacks of the 
Multics
     Compiler (lcp). Many of these hacks, including the entire first pass, were
     derived from the ITS Compiler (COMPLR, now NCOMPLR (or NCOMPL)), a
     much, much, hairier beast of which I have not yet achieved mastery. By
     learning that which I offer herein, the ambitious LISPman might not only
     acquire sufficient knowledge to modify or debug the Multics Compiler, but
     undertake the serious study of NCOMPLR. In fact, the state management
     hacks presented herein are of great interest in comparison to those of 
other
     modern compilers, e.g., Multics PL/I. He who comprehends this will also 
glean
     generally powerful knowledge of compiler-writing techniques in general, and
     will have interesting and useful knowledge under his belt.
