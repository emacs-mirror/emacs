ABSTRACT:

This paper presents a new model for scheduling the work of an incremental 
garbage collector in a system with hard real time requirements.  The method 
utilizes the fact that just some of the processes in the system have to meet 
hard real time requirements and that these processes typically run 
periodically, a fact that we can make use of when scheduling the garbage 
collection.  The work of the collector is scheduled to be performed in the 
pauses between the critical processes and is suspended when the processes with 
hard real time requirements run.  It is shown that this approach is feasible 
for many real time systems and that it leaves the time-critical parts of the 
system undisturbed from garbage collection induced delays.

REVIEWS:

It is aimed specifically at systems with real time requirements, where not all 
the processes in the system are assumed to have real time requirements.  We 
don't do this now, but it's conceivable that in the future we might.  Involves 
mutator cooperation with with the GC (writes are written into a log and the log 
processed at the beginning of a GC slice). Some lower bounds for the rate at 
which you need to collect are given, and some strategies you might follow.  
Solid stuff, but not terribly important.
