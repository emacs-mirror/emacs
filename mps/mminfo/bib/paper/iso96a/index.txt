ABSTRACT:

  This document specifies the form and establishes the interpretation of
  programs expressed in the programming language C++.  Its purpose is to
  promote  portability, reliability, maintainability, and efficient exe-
  cution of C++ language programs on a  variety  of  computing  systems.

REVIEWS:

Like many standards, it's tedious to read, but the information is not available 
anywhere else.  Take it with a pinch of salt, though: it might change, and you 
won't find an implementation anywhere that will work exactly like this.  Pekka
