ABSTRACT:

We have implemented the first copying garbage collector that permits continuous 
unimpeded mutator access to the original objects during copying. The garbage 
collector incrementally replicates all accessible objects and uses a mutation 
log to bring the replicas up-to-date with changes made by the mutator. An 
experimental implementation demonstrates that the costs of using our algorithm 
are small and that bounded pause times of 50 milliseconds can be readily 
achieved.

REVIEWS:

nickb: Going on from paper.noph92, Scott and Jim did the real-time collector 
that we had discussed. Concurrent collection was next (paper.on94).
