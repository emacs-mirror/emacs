ABSTRACT:

Orthogonal persistence provides a safe and convenient model of object 
persistence. We have implemented a transaction system which supports orthogonal 
persistence in a garbage-collected heap. In our system, replicating collection 
provides efficient concurrent garbage collection of the heap. In this paper, we 
show how replicating garbage collection can also be used to reduce commit 
operation latencies in our implementation.

We describe how our system implements transaction commit. We explain why the 
presence of non-persistent objects can add to the cost of this operation. We 
show how to eliminate these additional costs by using replicating garbage 
collection. The resulting implementation of orthogonal persistence should 
provide transaction performance that is independent of the quantity of 
non-persistent data in use. We expect efficient support for orthogonal 
persistence to be valuable in operating systems applications which use 
persistent data.

REVIEWS:

nickb: Not really all that relevant to MM?? I know the Dylan and Database 
people are interested in persistence. This uses the non-destructive property of 
replication to do transaction commits without scanning the transient heap.
