ABSTRACT:

With the advent of parallel systems, opportunities for efficiency exist that 
have yet to be exploited, especially in the area of garbage collection.  In 
this paper a parallel generational garbage collection algorithm is presented 
that extends previous work by exploiting opportunities for parallelism in the 
garbage collection process itself.  A prototype implementation of the parallel 
generational collector was developed and its execution simulated to determine 
its efficiency.  For a certain class of programs, the parallel generational 
collector performed up to 67% less copying than a parallel copy collector and 
reduced elapsed times up to an additional 12%. corresponding reductions in 
overhead for the ongoing program were also observed.
