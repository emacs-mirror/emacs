ABSTRACT:

Dynamic storage allocation has become increasingly important in many 
applications, in part due to the use of the object-oriented paradigm.  At the 
same time, processor architectures are including deeper cache memory 
hierarchies to hide the increasing latency to main memory.  In this paper, we 
investigate efforts to predict which heap objects will be highly referenced at 
the time they are allocated.  Our approach uses profile-based optimization, and 
considers a variety of different information sources present at the time of 
object allocation to predict the object's reference frequency.  Our results, 
based on measurements of four allocation intensive programs, show that program 
references to heap objects are highly skewed and that our prediction methods 
can successfully predict the program objects that will be the most highly 
referenced.  We show that using this technique, a large fraction of a program's 
heap references can be directed at a part of the heap that is small enough to 
fit in the cache (e.g., 8-64 kilobytes).
