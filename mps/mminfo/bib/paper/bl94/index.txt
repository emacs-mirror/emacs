ABSTRACT:

We show how to implement efficient copying garbage collection for Prolog. We 
measure the efficiency of the collector compared to a standard mark-sweep 
algorithm on several programs. We then show how to accomodate generational 
garbage collection and Prolog primitives that make the implementation more 
difficult.
The resulting algorithms are simpler and more efficient than the standard 
mark-sweep method on a range of benchmarks. The total execution times of the 
benchmark programs are reduced by 4 to 11 percent.
