REVIEWS:

The 1990 standard (currently, 1999-04-26) has been amended by two Technical 
Corrigenda (Technical Corrigendum 1 published in 1994 and Technical Corrigendum 
2 published in 1996) and "Amendment 1" published in 1995.  The usual ISO 
practice is for the current version of the standard to incorporate the changes 
of the amendments and corrigenda.  A new C standard is currently (1999-03-26) 
in the Final Committee Draft stage and is awaiting approval.  It should be 
published in 1999 or 2000.
