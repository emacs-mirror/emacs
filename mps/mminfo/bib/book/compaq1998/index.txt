ABSTRACT:

Alpha is a 64-bit load/store RISC architecture that is designed with particular 
emphasis on the three elements that most affect performance: clock speed, 
multiple instruction issue, and multiple processors.

The Alpha architects examined and analyzed current and theoretical RISC 
architecture design elements and developed high-performance alternatives for 
the Alpha architecture. The architects adopted only those design elements that 
appeared valuable for a projected 25-year design horizon. Thus, Alpha becomes 
the first 21st century computer architecture.

The Alpha architecture is designed to avoid bias toward any particular 
operating system or pro-gramming language. Alpha supports the OpenVMS Alpha, 
DIGITAL UNIX, and Windows NT Alpha operating systems and supports simple 
software migration for applications that run on those operating systems.

This manual describes in detail how Alpha is designed to be the leadership 
64-bit architecture of the computer industry.

REVIEWS:

review.drj: version 4 of the much loved handbook.  (version 3 can be found in 
book.digital96(0)).  The PDF is improved in that there is now a contents 
browser pane (though the file itself has gone up from 800KB to 5MB (!)).  
However the preface is much worsened; there is no summary of the changes 
between version 3 and version 4.  The most noticeable change is the change of 
owner from Digital to Compaq.  My comments on version 3 still apply.
