ABSTRACT:

The Software Engineer's Reference Book is _the_ comprehensive reference for the 
professional software engineer.   Written by an international team of 
contributors from both industry and academia, this book covers the whole topic 
of software engineering from the underlying computer science and mathematics, 
through the technology of software specification, design, and management, to 
the principles of major computer applications.

The Software Engineer's Reference Book provides valuable information for 
software developers, project managers in industry, consultants, and researchers.

John McDermid, the Editor, is Professor of Software Engineering at the 
University of York, UK.  He is author of over fifty publications on Software 
Engineering, Computer Engineering, and Computer Science.  Before taking his 
post at York, he was Manager of the Research and Development Division of 
SD-Scicon (formerly Systems Designers), a leading British Software House.
