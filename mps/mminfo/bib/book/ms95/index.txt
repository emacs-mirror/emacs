ABSTRACT:

This book describes fundamental techniques that can be used to enhance the 
visual quality of graphical user interfaces, data displays, and multimedia 
productions.  The authors approach interface design from the perspective of 
communication-oriented graphic design, industrial design, and architecture.  
The skills, practice, and orientation of these design disciplines are essential 
to the success of every graphical interface, yet few software developers, human 
factors professionals, or product managers receive any training in these 
areas.  Designing Visual Interfaces addresses this shortcoming by describing 
essential design concepts as manifested in the graphical user interface.  The 
book presents basic design principles, common errors, and practical techniques 
in each of six major areas:

  - Elegance and Simplicity
  - Scale, Contrast, and Proportion
  - Organization and Visual Structure
  - Module and Program
  - Image and Representation
  - Style

Designing Visual Interfaces will be useful to anyone responsible for designing, 
specifying, implementing, documenting, or managing the appearance of 
computer-based information displays.  Design concepts are supported by 
hundrerds of illustrations, with an emphasis on visual examples drawn from 
dozens of existing software products.  Readers will gain a new persepctive on 
product development and an appreciation for the contribution that effective 
visual design offers their products and users.
