ABSTRACT:

Not the blurb, but the series foreword:

The Java Series books provide definitive reference documentation for Java 
programmers and end users.  They are written by members of the Java team and 
published under the auspices of JavaSoft, a Sun Microsystems business.  The 
World-Wide-Web allows Java documentation to be made available over the 
Internet, either by downloading or as hypertext.  Nevertheless, the world-wide 
interest in Java technology led us to write and publish these books to 
supplement all of the documentation at our Web site.  To learn the latest about 
the Java Platform and Environment or download the latest Java release, visit 
our World Wide Web site at http://java.sun.com.  For updated information about 
the Java Series, including sample code, errata, and pre-views of forthcoming 
books, visit http://java.sun.com/Series.
