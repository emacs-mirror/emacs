ABSTRACT:

(From the preface:) The International Symposium on Memory Management is a forum 
for research in several related areas of memory management, especially garbage 
collectors and dynamic storage allocators. [...] The nineteen papers selected 
for publication in this volume cover a remarkably broad range of memory 
management topics from explicit malloc-style allocation to automatic memory 
management, from cache-conscious data layout to efficient management of 
distributed references, from conservative to type-accurate garbage collection, 
for applications ranging from user application to long-running servers, 
supporting languages as different as C, C++, Modula-3, Java, Eiffel, Erlang, 
Scheme, ML, Haskell and Prolog.

REVIEWS:

[Many of these papers are separately represented in the db.  This is mainly 
here to record the data and give it a tag.  I don't think it would be 
appropriate to add keywords.  pekka 1999-02-18]
