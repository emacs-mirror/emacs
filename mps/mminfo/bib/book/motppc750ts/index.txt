ABSTRACT:

Technical Summary (31 pages).

The MPC750 implements the 32-bit portion
of the PowerPC architecture, which provides 32-bit effective addresses, integer 
data types of 8, 16, and 32
bits, and floating-point data types of 32 and 64 bits. The MPC750 is a 
superscalar processor that can
complete two instructions simultaneously. It incorporates the following six 
execution units:
- Floating-point unit (FPU)
- Branch processing unit (BPU)
- System register unit (SRU)
- Load/store unit (LSU)
- Two integer units (IUs): IU1 executes all integer instructions. IU2 executes 
all integer instructions
except multiply and divide instructions.
