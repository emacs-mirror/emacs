ABSTRACT:

Dylan is a new programming language invented by Apple Computer and developed 
with Harlequin and other partners.  The language is both object-oriented, like 
C++ and Java, and dynamic, like Smalltalk.  Dylan is designed to deliver 
applications that run efficiently on a wide range of platforms.  It also 
facilitates the rapid development and incremental refinement of prototype 
programs.  Dylan is a good choice for any application, but you will find it 
particularly useful for complex object-oriented programs, and for programs that 
may need to be changed "on the fly".

Public domain implementations of Dylan are available for most popular computer 
systems.  Harlequin has developed the first complete, commercial implementation 
of the language -- including both compiler and development environment.

Dylan Programming gets you started quickly, with a simple but complete program 
that lets you experiment with the language.  It then leads you through the 
development of a sample application, illustrating advanced topics such as 
macros, modules, libraries, inheritance, performance, and exceptions.  This 
book is appropriate for any Dylan implementation.  It assumes you can program 
in a conventional language, but requires no prior knowledge of object-oriented 
or dynamic techniques.
