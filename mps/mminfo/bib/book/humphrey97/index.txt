ABSTRACT:

This newest book from Watts Humphrey is a hands-on introduction to basic 
disciplines of software engineering. Designed as a workbook companion to any 
introductory programming or software-engineering text, Humphrey provides here 
the practical means to integrate his highly regarded Personal Software Process 
(PSP) into college and university curricula. 
The book may also be adapted for use in industrial training or for 
self-improvement by practicing software engineers.

Applying the book's exercises to their course assignments, students learn both 
to manage their time effectively and to monitor the quality of their work, good 
practices they will need to be successful in their future careers. The book is 
supported by its own electronic supplement, which includes spreadsheets for 
data entry and analysis. A complete instructor's package is also available.

By mastering PSP techniques early in their studies, students can avoid -- or 
overcome -- the popular "hacker" ethic that leads to so many bad habits. 
Employers will appreciate new hires prepared to do competent professional work 
without, as now is common, expensive retraining and years of experience.
