ABSTRACT:

Zero-defect software is the Holy Grail of all software developers.  It has 
proved to be an elusive goal -- until now.  The Inspection techniques 
illustrated in this book have brought clear benefits in terms of lower (or even 
zero) defects, higher productivity, better project tracking, and improved 
documentation.

Highlights of the book include:

  - Clear guidelines for the introduction and refinement of Inspection 
techniques.

  - Numerous examples of successful implementations in organizations such as 
AT&T and Douglas Aircraft.

  - Case studies based on actual experience with the method at IBM, Thorn EMI, 
Cray Research, Sema Group, Racal Redac, and Applicon.

  "...if you are not now doing inspections, you must read this book and apply 
its
   lessons.  If you are doing inspections, this book has many hints and ideas
   that will help you to do them better." -- from the foreword by Watts S. 
Humphrey
