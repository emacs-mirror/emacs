ABSTRACT:

From "About This Book"

This book describes the Mac OS runtime architecture based upon the Code
Fragment Manager (CFM) as well as the original classic 68K runtime
architecture.

[...]

In addition to describing the runtime architectures, this book also covers
information such as calling conventions for each architecture implementation,
data and register types and sizes, and details of structures encountered when
building Macintosh programs (segments, fragments, and so on).

REVIEWS:

.review.drj: Chapter 4 contains details of the alignment requirements for 
datatypes in C.  The bottom line is that objects 8bytes or larger may require 
8byte alignment and this is the strictest alignment in the system (but you have 
to look at "Macintosh C/C++ ABI Revision 1.3" to find that out because long 
doubles and some other types aren't discussed here).  The same Chapter also 
contains details of the stack layout and of the register conventions (including 
saved registers) for a procedure call.
