language since the publication of the PostScript® Language Reference Manual, 
Second Edition.

REVIEWS:

[ScriptWorks Information\Documentation\Postscript Level 3 contains the document 
and errata in PDF, plus various tech notes, which we'll hopefully never need.  
There are also papers giving some background.  pekka 1999-01-19]
