ABSTRACT:

In general, developing fast applications for Intel Architecture (IA) processors 
is not difficult. An understanding of the architecture and good development 
practices make the difference between a fast application and one that runs 
significantly slower than its full potential. Of course, applications developed 
for the 8086/8088, 80286, Intel386™ (DX or SX), and Intel486™ processors will 
execute on the Pentium ® , Pentium Pro and Pentium II processors without any 
modification or recompilation. However, the following code optimization 
techniques and architectural information will help you tune your application to 
its greatest potential.

REVIEWS:

drj: Contains details of execution pipeline and cache and other things useful 
for tuning, for the Pentium, Pentium Pro, and Pentium II processors.  Contains 
execution times and pairing tables.
