ABSTRACT:

About This Book

The primary objective of this manual is to help programmers provide software 
that is compatible across the family of PowerPC™ processors. Because the 
PowerPC architecture is designed to be flexible to support a broad range of 
processors, this book provides a general description of features that are 
common to PowerPC processors and indicates those features that are optional or 
that may be implemented differently in the design of each processor.

This revision of this book describes both the 64- and the 32-bit portions of 
the PowerPC architecture from the perspective of the 64-bit architecture. The 
information in this manual that pertains only to the 32-bit architecture is 
presented in PowerPC Microprocessor Family: The Programming Environments for 
32-Bit Microprocessors. Both books reflect changes to the PowerPC architecture 
made subsequent to the publication of PowerPC Microprocessor Family: The 
Programming Environments, Rev. 0 and Rev. 0.1.
