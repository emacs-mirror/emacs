ABSTRACT:

First business discovered _quality_ as a key competitive edge; next came 
_service_.  Now, Donald A. Norman, Director of the Institute for Cognitive 
Science at the University of California, reveals how smart _design_ is the new 
competitive frontier.  The Design of Everyday Things is a powerful primer on 
how -- and why -- some product satisfy customers while others only frustrate 
them.
