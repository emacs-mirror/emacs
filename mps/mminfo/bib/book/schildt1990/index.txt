REVIEWS:

.drj: It has the text of the ISO standard 9899-1990 (standard C) on the left 
hand pages, and Schildt's annotations on the right hand pages.  The standard is 
missing the cover sheet and the introduction (the introduction crucially 
explaining which parts of the document form the standard (in particular, 
examples, annexes, and footnotes do not form part of the standard)).  Page 132 
is misprinted in early editions.  The syntax for floating constants (clause 
6.1.3.1) is missing a . in the second line for the rule for 
fractional-constant.  Schildt's annotations vary from anodyne to dangerously 
wrong, don't read them.

My recommendation is to only read the left hand pages (text of the standard), 
and never read an example or a footnote.  Some of the annexes are useful and 
appear to be accurate.
