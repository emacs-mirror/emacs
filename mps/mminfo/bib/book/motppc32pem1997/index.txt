ABSTRACT:

About This Book

The primary objective of this manual is to help programmers provide software 
that is compatible across the family of PowerPC™ processors. Because the 
PowerPC architecture is designed to be flexible to support a broad range of 
processors, this book provides a general description of features that are 
common to PowerPC processors and indicates those features that are optional or 
that may be implemented differently in the design of each processor.

This revision of this book describes only the 32-bit portion of the PowerPC 
architecture in detail. This book provides a subset of the information provided 
in PowerPC Microprocessor Family: The Programming Environments, which describes 
both the 64- and 32-bit portions of the architecture. Both books reflect 
changes to the PowerPC architecture made subsequent to the publication of 
PowerPC Microprocessor Family: The Programming Environments, Rev. 0 and Rev. 
0.1.
