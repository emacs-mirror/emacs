ABSTRACT:

About This Book

The primary objective of this user’s manual is to define the functionality of 
the PowerPC 604e™ microprocessor for use by software and hardware developers. 
It is important to note that this book is intended as a companion to the 
PowerPC™Microprocessor Family: The Programming Environments, referred to as The 
Programming Environments Manual; contact your local sales representative to 
obtain a copy. Because the PowerPC architecture is designed to be flexible to 
support a broad range of processors, The Programming Environments Manual 
provides a general description of features that are common to PowerPC 
processors and indicates those features that are optional or that may be 
implemented differently in the design of each processor.
