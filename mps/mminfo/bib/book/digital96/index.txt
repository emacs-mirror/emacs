ABSTRACT:

Alpha is a 64-bit load/store RISC architecture that is designed with particular 
emphasis on the three elements that most affect performance: clock speed, 
multiple instruction issue, and multiple processors.

The Alpha architects examined and analyzed current and theoretical RISC 
architecture design elements and developed high-performance alternatives for 
the Alpha architecture. The architects adopted only those design elements that 
appeared valuable for a projected 25-year design horizon. Thus, Alpha becomes 
the first 21st century computer architecture.

The Alpha architecture is designed to avoid bias toward any particular 
operating system or programming language. Alpha supports the OpenVMS Alpha, 
Digital UNIX, and Windows NT Alpha operating systems and supports simple 
software migration for applications that run on those operating systems.

This manual describes in detail how Alpha is designed to be the leadership 
64-bit architecture of the computer industry.

REVIEWS:

review.drj: More importantly the Architecture Handbook describes the 
architecture of the alpha.  All the user level instructions are defined and the 
user level PAL calls for the existing OSs (VMS, UNIX, NT).  No mention of 
explicit performance figures (because this is the _architecture_ handbook), 
though extensive hints and guidelines are given.  Has a detailed description of 
memory-like behaviour and the Alpha's relaxed memory ordering.  drj 1998-01-29
