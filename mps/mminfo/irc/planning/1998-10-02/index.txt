.drj.14-02-44: Problems in scheduling:

.drj.14-03-32: rk] intended spec' of minnow got changed very late

.drj.14-03-43: rk] due to communication breakdown

.drj.14-04-29: rk] change.epcore.minnow.160078 (splinters?)

.drj.14-04-55: rk] change.epcore.minnow.160073 (commit limit)

.drj.14-05-25: rk] anchovy was better than minnow in this respect.  No very 
late and surprising change of spec'.

.drj.14-06-01: ptw] paniced trying to make anchovy to schedule

.drj.14-06-23: ptw] mm has become very event driven.  

.drj.14-07-05: ptw] big picture never gets done.

.drj.14-07-29: agreement all round

.drj.14-08-27: gavinm] what each release should do in order to satisfy clients 
is not clear

.drj.14-08-40: gavinm] long term things always get left

.drj.14-09-02: ptw] implementing big picture may make it easier to leverage 
specific solutions for customers more quickly.

.drj.14-09-52: drj] unclear what releases we have

.drj.14-10-02: drj] unclear how much work we are supposed to be doing for those 
releases

.drj.14-10-09: drj] unclear who is supposed to be doing it.

.drj.14-10-27: gavinm] manpower resourcing is not clear

.logbot.14-11-44.1: My CODE of ETHICS is vacationing at famed SCHROON LAKE

.logbot.14-11-44.2:  in upstate New York!!

.drj.14-13-42: importance of long term strategic planning and development is 
stressd again

.drj.14-15-21: rk] not enough analysis.  analysis of problem should come before 
goals and requirements?

.drj.14-16-40: rk] we cannot get past obstacles unless we understand the nature 
of the problems hence analysis

.drj.14-18-07: rk] problem in design.  whereby: problems are encountered, only 
vaguely understood.  then we go all the way from a commitment to designs and 
solutions without understanding fully how the 

.drj.14-18-17: rk] solutions will impact the poorly understood problem

.drj.14-18-31: ptw] iteration is good.

.drj.14-19-19: rk] big bang is bad and we have been doing this.

.ptw.14-19-37: I got hung up on.

.richardk.14-20-11: we're trying to reconm you

.drj.14-20-38: rk] expecting solutions crafted from a poor understanding of the 
problems to solve the problem is unwise.  and doesn't work.

.drj.14-21-04: rit] we produce things at the last minute which are enormous 
great big changes and they don't work.

.richardk.14-21-17: ACTION sees Gav go to the whiteboard.

.drj.14-21-21: /

.drj.14-21-31: Goals and Requirements

.drj.14-22-00: [of planning and scheduling process]

.drj.14-25-36: is working out what we are required to do

.drj.14-25-47: and whatwork we need to do to meet those requirements..

.drj.14-26-02: part of planning.

.drj.14-27-04: gavinm] requirements negotiation and design/architecture work is 
excluded from this meeting

.drj.14-27-57: ptw] goal is optimising use of scarce resources/

.drj.14-28-13: rit] keeping people happy

.drj.14-28-48: gavinm] people = {customers} u {group}

.drj.14-29-21: rk] help us spot problems early

.drj.14-29-55: rk] corrections are made to our course

.drj.14-30-46: rk] goal of scheduling and planning should support the ways in 
which we change the plan, in particular the process we go through when 
discovering problems

.drj.14-32-05: rk] schedule must be easily changeable and comparin it to what 
is actually going on.

.drj.14-32-38: risk management

.drj.14-32-57: ptw] immaturity is a risk

.drj.14-33-14: risk is a combination of likelihood of failure and magnitude of 
failure

.drj.14-34-36: drj] scheduling should allow us to meet external requirements

.drj.14-34-52: perhaps by preventing us from making commitments which we cannot 
meet

.drj.14-35-18: I meant external commitments not external requirements

.richardk.14-35-28: ACTION thinks we don't need much discussion of how to meet 
impossible requirements.  :-)

.drj.14-35-34: gavinm] scheduling should allow us to know what external 
commitments we can make

.drj.14-35-44: rit] does scheduling allows us to be flexible?  should it?

.drj.14-36-41: customer can change their mind and expect us to meet new 
requirements very quickly.  scheduling process should allow for that.

.drj.14-37-46: rit] scheduling should not reduce productivity (!)

.drj.14-38-19: the cynicism virus is spreading.

.drj.14-39-05: rk+drj] there are probably more goals and requirements

.drj.14-39-52: ptw] client inputs are well managed and tracked.

.drj.14-40-09: ptw] but internal requirements are not well tracked.

.drj.14-40-34: tony] see point 6 "design and elegance"

.drj.14-40-57: tony] and 3 "dependencies"

.drj.14-42-11: ptw] so for example work which could easily be generic has a 
danger of being made taylored to a particular client.

.drj.14-42-22: Dylan Scheduling

.drj.14-42-38: tony] dylan use a project planning tool to do their scheduling.

.drj.14-42-47: tony] data sharing is done by hand

.drj.14-42-57: tony] project plan is maintained by the "group planners"

.drj.14-43-05: tony] manager e {planners}

.drj.14-43-26: tony] plan is at least 3 months ahead

.drj.14-43-42: tony] accessible to group.  at least read only.

.drj.14-44-04: tony] view of the project tool, GANTT chart, get faxed to 
everyone in the group.,

.drj.14-44-11: tony] members of the group work according to the plan

.drj.14-44-26: tony] work can be parallelised

.drj.14-44-47: tony] key point: actuall progress on tasks is tracked and the 
plan is changed

.logbot.14-44-53.1: I wonder if I should put myself in ESCROW!!

.ptw.14-45-02: You hung up on me again

.drj.14-45-17: tony] every two weeks each member meets the planners

.drj.14-45-20: tony] and updates them

.richardk.14-45-30: Getting you bavck online, ptw

.drj.14-45-43: ptw you are engaged?

.richardk.14-45-47: Gav: "He's engaged"

.gavinm.14-45-47: He's engaged.

.ptw.14-46-12: I'm not

.richardk.14-46-24: Gav tries again.

.gavinm.14-46-25: He is.

.ptw.14-46-31: Perhaps the error is at your end

.drj.14-46-41: cuold be

.richardk.14-46-44: ACTION tries to make an external call.

.gavinm.14-46-44: I can't bring you in.

.ptw.14-46-50: I'll call gavin

.ptw.14-47-57: He's not answering...  Not even voice mail

.gavinm.14-48-04: Try again.

.richardk.14-48-08: Gav's just droped out -- try again!

.ptw.14-48-24: I think East Anglia has become disconnnected from the rest of 
the world.

.richardk.14-48-28: Then Gav: you park tucker and tell me the park.

.drj.14-48-34: except via IRC

.gavinm.14-48-37: What a waste of time.

.drj.14-48-43: quick, get an IPPHONE

.gavinm.14-48-50: Let's continue by IRC and Ibid only.

.tony.14-49-42: OK - shall I continue by IRC?

.drj.14-49-48: y

.gavinm.14-49-49: Tony was ewxplaining the Dylan method.

.tony.14-49-55: PTW - what did you hear last?

.ptw.14-49-58: Guess we need NetMeeting...

.ptw.14-50-10: I heard my phone go dead, just as you started.

.drj.14-50-20: drj is going in 5 mins

.tony.14-50-25: I'll resume from the end of DRJ's notes, then

.ptw.14-50-37: Ok

.tony.14-50-57: There is a 2-weekly meeting between "group planners" & each 
group member

.tony.14-51-17: planners ask about tasks which should be in progress & get a 
status report

.tony.14-51-24: The plan is updated to reflect this

.drj.14-51-33: is this a face-to-face meeting?

.tony.14-52-06: It usually happens by phone if in a different office

.tony.14-52-12: otherwise fact to face

.tony.14-52-33: The group member may make suggestions for changing the plan ...

.gavinm.14-52-37: Dylan use Microsoft Project?

.tony.14-52-46: ... either at the meeting or at any other time.

.tony.14-53-13: Gavin - yet, they use Microsoft project, although 
CASuperproject was used in the past

.gavinm.14-53-32: How much details do gorup members get about what others are 
doing?

.tony.14-53-42: The planners make decisins about the knock-on effects for the 
schedule

.drj.14-53-50: a random low-level comment, the plan and schedule should be able 
to cope with well defined areas of vagueness and uncertainty

.gavinm.14-53-51: How visible is the justification for the plan?

.tony.14-54-33: gavinm1: You see the gant chart overview - but each tasks 
corresponds to a description in NOtes

.tony.14-55-01: drj: agreed - I'll say a bit more in a min

.tony.14-55-26: gavinm2: The plan as shown in the tool includes no justification

.drj.14-55-32: ACTION proceeds to enbus

.drj.14-55-38: sorry to go

.drj.14-55-44: bye all

.tony.14-56-10: Moving on ...

.ptw.14-56-11: [Aside:  we could have these meetings earlier than 10EDT on days 
I am home.]

.richardk.14-56-17: ACTION sees rit go too.

.tony.14-56-28: I won't describe how the planners make decisions

.gavinm.14-56-31: [ Friday is pub lunch day.]

.tony.14-56-44: But of course they benefit from having a planning tool

.tony.14-57-03: Input to the plan happens roughly as follows...

.gavinm.14-57-11: So what you've told us is largely about visibility of the 
plan, and a way to update it.

.tony.14-57-41: The planners ask group members to define tasks for achieving 
goals - including analysis, design & impl tasks

.ptw.14-57-54: Does the plan show "unstaffed" projects?

.tony.14-58-02: gavinm: yes. more about input shortly

.tony.14-58-09: ptw: yes

.gavinm.14-58-22: [4] Does the plan cover all things that people spend time on?

.tony.14-58-40: The group members won't necessarily be the people who do the 
work

.tony.14-58-57: gavinm: yes in principle. More later about that

.ptw.14-59-19: [It would be sufficient to plan that not 100% of each person is 
available for scheduling, due to overhead.]

.tony.14-59-30: Some group members get called on to define tasks more than 
others. That's sensible in practice

.gavinm.14-59-48: PTW: Only if overhead were constant.

.tony.14-59-54: ptw: scheduling is obviously something that the tool helps with

.gavinm.15-00-10: PTW: Overhead tends to creep to include many things.

.tony.15-00-38: Tasks and time estimates can be vague initially - e.g. if 
analysis has not yet been done

.gavinm.15-00-58: That's something DARWIN is bad at modelling.

.tony.15-01-07: Releases are represented on the plan as milestones

.tony.15-01-23: The planning tool records dependencies between tasks

.tony.15-02-00: Group members get to agree on the time estimates for any task 
they get scheduled to do. They may negotiate if they wish

.tony.15-02-27: Group members who feel they should be involve in other tasks 
may ask to be reassigned 

.tony.15-02-34:  ... at the discretion of the planners

.gavinm.15-02-53: [5] Were you a planner, Tony?

.tony.15-03-08: Typically there is a task description in DARWIN (or the Dylan 
equivalent) for everything in the plan.

.tony.15-03-27: gavinm: No - I wasn't a planner except at the very beginning 
(pre JH)

.tony.15-03-43: gavinm: But I did define a large number of the tasks

.tony.15-04-17: That's about it for direct input. I'll answer any questions 
frrom now on

.ptw.15-04-24: Just in from sysadmins: BT are having serious problems in the SE 
of England, so calls in and out of

.ptw.15-04-25: Cambridge sites are somewhat unreliable.

.gavinm.15-04-32: Is it important to have more than one planner?

.tony.15-04-57: gavin: no. But for Dylan the workload was more than JH wanted 
so he got help

.gavinm.15-05-23: [ PTW, You could presumably still reach my mobile, if you 
desperately needed to get through. ]

.ptw.15-05-57: This sounds like enough of an improvement over our present 
situation, that I would just do it

.gavinm.15-06-02: We're a somewhat smaller group.

.tony.15-06-07: My thoughts too

.tony.15-06-22: The smaller we are, the easier it is to maintain

.gavinm.15-07-08: I have in the past tried to keep a manual list of everyone's 
tasks, with deadlines and estimates, and to maintain them by talking to people.

.richardk.15-07-13: I think it's certainly worth trying, at least as an 
evolutionary approach. -- Wanna get cheap experience early, and as this has 
been done before it should be cheap for us to set up.

.ptw.15-07-20: (Perhaps you answered this)  Can I view the schedule in some 
electronic fashion?  .pdf, web, whatever?

.gavinm.15-07-26: I found it very tedious, and hard to deduce things from.

.richardk.15-07-32: (cheap) and quick => early.

.gavinm.15-07-35: Tony said they faxed the charts about.

.tony.15-08-10: ptw: Dylan didn't have that - but it IS possible to do it

.ptw.15-08-22: Your manual lists were not visible to anyone

.ptw.15-08-39: Faxing is fine, just low tech.

.gavinm.15-08-40: True.  They also didn't really cover everyone in the group.

.tony.15-08-47: richardk: yes we could try it. But note the startup cost of 
getting the plan in shape is not insignificant

.richardk.15-08-51: not vis]  indeed: I think it's key that they be visible.

.gavinm.15-09-12: If they aren't visible, we don't meet most of Tony's 
requirements.

.richardk.15-09-21: visible] Because we _have_ had ad-hoc informal invisble 
schedules in the past, but they've been _wrong_.

.tony.15-09-30: Faxes are visible aren't they if everyone has one?

.richardk.15-09-37: And the wroongness wasn't spotted because the plans weren't 
visible.

.tony.15-09-55: On-line access is clearly better, though

.richardk.15-10-04: ACTION thinks faxes would suffice.

.richardk.15-10-15: thinks/guesses

.gavinm.15-10-26: My manual lists had a certain visibility, because I checked 
them with everyone fairly frequently.

.richardk.15-10-41: (Tucker should have the say on this!)

.tony.15-10-50: gavinm: but did you check all tasks on them with everyone?

.gavinm.15-11-11: No, just the people doing the tasks.

.ptw.15-11-16: Right:  I was never aware of what others in the group were 
doing, except accidentally

.tony.15-11-20: That's a key difference

.gavinm.15-11-28: My output was whether anyone was overloaded to meet 
commitments.

.tony.15-11-46: The planning tool should be able to work that out!

.gavinm.15-12-05: ... and then it was up to Richard to do something about it.

.tony.15-12-39: So - are we going to do it, then?

.ptw.15-12-43: Another requirement:  justify additional staffing

.gavinm.15-12-55: ACTION gets through to PTW.

.tony.15-13-02: ptw: yes - it's good for that

.gavinm.15-13-58: Where are we going to go from here.

.gavinm.15-14-37: Goals and requirements RFC.

.gavinm.15-14-47: Could experiment with Dylan Method.

.gavinm.15-14-54: Tony: Heavy startup cost.

.gavinm.15-15-10: Tony: If we need to have a plan anyway,. the startup cost is 
necessary.

.gavinm.15-17-16: I have prefered Notes solution because they offer 
inter-database information transfer, and allow distributed visibility and 
update.

.gavinm.15-17-50: Tony: DARWIN doesn't have much of the information.  A 
planning tool allows manipulation and calculation.

.gavinm.15-18-48: Project Gateway is a NOtes-based planning tool.

.gavinm.15-19-06: Specific tool is small part of process described.

.gavinm.15-19-43: RHSK: Dylan Method sounds a good evo step.  We know it 
already works; we get useful data straight away.

.gavinm.15-20-13: RichardK: Changing the Dylan Method increases risk.

.gavinm.15-21-50: RichardK: Would be less risky to use MS Project, and port 
data later.

.gavinm.15-22-13: Tony: Expensive part is coming up with a real plan.

.gavinm.15-22-24: Tony: Moving between tools would be very hard.

.gavinm.15-22-34: Tony: Moving between tools would not be very hard.

.richardk.15-23-02: The line "<gavinm> Tony: Moving between tools would be very 
hard." was a mistake.

.gavinm.15-23-51: 1-5 yes

.gavinm.15-23-55: 6 helpd

.gavinm.15-24-01: 6: It helps

.gavinm.15-24-13: 7: Yes.

.gavinm.15-24-34: 8,9: Yes.

.gavinm.15-25-58: Board 1-3: Yes.

.gavinm.15-26-10: Board 4: Management overhead, but needed anyway

.gavinm.15-26-13: Board 5: Yes.

.ptw.15-27-19: You're gone again, but we're done, aren't we?

.gavinm.15-27-59: Seems to meet all bopard goals.

.gavinm.15-28-09: Stay on IRC for a minute.

.ptw.15-28-15: ok

.gavinm.15-28-19: We're just taking about Risk Management.

.richardk.15-28-22: Under "Manage Risk" -- let us consider contingency plans?

.gavinm.15-28-44: It certainly let's you model "what if"s.

.tony.15-28-49: It helps us see the effect of problems

.richardk.15-28-59: I spose it would.  Notably for anchovy we did do this: we 
had a contingency plan for a new class for temp-pool, in case mvff was too 
slow. 

.tony.15-29-00: It helps us react if problems occur

.richardk.15-29-17: ACTION 's last remark was about contingency plans

.gavinm.15-29-46: Do the DYlan Group have documentation for their scheduling 
process? 

.tony.15-29-54: No

.gavinm.15-30-09: So we can publish first?  8-)

.tony.15-30-19: It's not exactly rocket science

.gavinm.15-30-37: That's good, because let's face it guys:

.gavinm.15-30-44: We're not exactly rocket scientists.

.tony.15-30-48: touche
