week, and 61 calls on Thursday.

.gavinm.14-20-43: Apparently I can either get my 'phone reenabled in half an 
hour, if I'm prepared to change number, or by sending it away for a week not to.

.gavinm.14-21-29: This all seemed very efficient, except that today they sent a 
courier who wanted me to tell him where the package was going.  Sigh.
