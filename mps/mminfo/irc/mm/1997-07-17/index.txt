.gavinm.12-50-54: Hello.

.pekka.13-07-27: Hello.

.pekka.13-09-39: 72 sounds pretty impressive even as an absolute number (not 
having had any experience of edits to compare it to)

.lmb.13-10-54: eh?  what's an absolute number?

.pekka.13-16-16: Before you arrived, Gavin boasted about having resolved 72 
edits in yesterday's session!

.gavinm.13-19-11: I worked a little beyond the end of the session.

.lmb.13-49-18: oh, i see.  congrats, gavin. :)

.lmb.13-49-34: ACTION wonders if "a little beyond" is 72 hours :)

.gavinm.13-59-33: I did about 10 hours, as opposed to the customary 4.

.lmb.14-12-25: i was about to add "or just 7". 

.lmb.14-22-30: how did you find out when your spring training classes were 
scheduled for?

.pekka.14-23-08: I got several reminders by email (it's in that db as well, I 
suppose)

.lmb.14-23-26: i'm still waiting for my email reminders.  i refuse to look in 
the db.

.lmb.14-23-36: hwo different is notes 4?

.pekka.14-23-50: Not different enough.

.lmb.14-23-58: ACTION grins

.pekka.14-26-37: There's lots of new features, but the useability is about the 
same.

.pekka.14-27-11: ACTION manages to restrain himself from listing all the small 
annoyances

.lmb.14-27-28: i don't even use all the features there are.

.lmb.14-27-40: ACTION wonders what happens if she doesn't go to her class

.gavinm.14-27-40: Leah, 1997-08-15 09:00 - 13:00 

.lmb.14-27-50: shhhh!!!  don't tell me.

.lmb.14-28-04: kne has already said that if i can't go, roy can teach me later.

.lmb.14-28-21: err...ken, even.  roy owes me some favors anyway.

.gavinm.14-28-48: They don't send the reminders until quite close to the time.

.lmb.14-29-13: if i get a reminder and i'm not feeling erribly pressed, i'll 
go.  and sleep. :)

.gavinm.14-29-18: Say, about a week in advance.

.lmb.14-29-25: ACTION twiddles her typing knob.

.gavinm.14-29-39: The book they give you is alright.

.lmb.14-30-06: what sort of book?

.pekka.14-30-10: And contains most of what they teach.

.lmb.14-30-36: i'm happy to teach myself.  i wonder if anyone would notice. :)

.pekka.14-30-54: I hear Yehouda walked out after 40 mins.

.pekka.14-31-28: Of course, he never cared about it very much

.pekka.14-32-10: So, it would have been a waste of time for him

.lmb.18-23-42: do you want silly ideas, or solid ones?

.lmb.18-24-11: paper, definitely.  various electronic formats; i like 
PostScript, PDF, HTML, and perhaps text.

.pekka.18-24-15: I want to hear the silly ones!

.lmb.18-24-21: ACTION grins

.lmb.18-24-30:  print the reference manual on one of those screen glare reducers

.lmb.18-24-34: +in matte black. : )

.lmb.18-25-06: mm birdcages.  laminated wallet cards.

.lmb.18-26-06: pekka: these are ideas for quick reference media.

.lmb.18-26-30: any ideas, gavin?

.gavinm.18-26-44: year planners

.lmb.18-29-14: mm pens and pencils.

.lmb.18-29-26: mm flash cards.  "Do you know this symbol?"

.gavinm.18-29-27: The reverse site of window mounted Fresnell lens satellite 
"dishes".

.lmb.18-29-39: tiles from the mm space shuttle. :)

.lmb.18-29-51: hey, reasonable one:  mm mugs.

.lmb.18-30-27: i'd suggest mm magnetic poem sets, but i remember how 
disappointed i was when my microsoft set had ActiveX and Internet magnets in.

.gavinm.18-30-39: I've just had another thought.  

.gavinm.18-31-32: Would it be possible to hook up the MPS to public domain 
programs, e.g. Perl, and republish them as faster versions.

.lmb.18-32-04: why not?

.gavinm.18-32-14: Well copyright reasons for a start.

.gavinm.18-32-18: Or copyleft.

.gavinm.18-32-52: I believe Perl 5 uses reference counting with a GC backup to 
break cycles.

.lmb.18-33-16: is the source public domain, or just the executables?

.gavinm.18-33-42: I think the source is.  People do ports from time to time.

.lmb.18-33-55: as long as we don't charge for it.....

.gavinm.18-34-17: That might not be good enough, unfortunately.

.pekka.18-34-50: Perl is GPL, I checked

.gavinm.18-35-11: What does that imply in this context?

.pekka.18-35-35: Source code must be provided for "derived works".

.gavinm.18-35-45: No good for us then.

.gavinm.18-37-31: But certainly we could get good publicity by boosting a free 
utility.

.pekka.18-38-16: And bad publicity trying to subvert the license that makes it 
free.

.pekka.18-38-54: We could use these things as benchmarks

.gavinm.18-39-08: I was thinking that, if we found the right free utility, we 
could make an arrangement with the author.

.pekka.18-39-28: Indeed, I intend to for the drop-in interface.

.pekka.18-40-00: I guess it's possible

.lmb.18-45-53: ooooh, i see.

.lmb.18-46-18: it probably wouldn't help to write a memory manager specifically 
for that program.

.lmb.18-46-27: help us marketing-wise, i mean.

.gavinm.18-46-36: If we offered to take the author's code, fiddle with the 
memory management, add a binary library and make it go twice as fast, he would 
be sure to sing our praises.

.gavinm.18-47-12: LMB, Well no, but we could cosy the two programs together 
more closely that the drop-in interface will allow.

.lmb.18-47-42: ACTION is intrigued

.lmb.18-47-48: too bad i'm not a developer.

.lmb.18-48-03: ACTION decides to skip two difficult chapters and write an easy 
one this afternoon.

.gavinm.18-49-20: What I mean is, that we wouldn't have to stick to level 1 use 
(drop-in), and could event go as far as level 5 (Harlequin consultancy and 
bespoke pools).

.gavinm.18-49-38: e/event/even/  I think I must have events on the brain.

.gavinm.18-50-37: ACTION decides to go home and pack soon.

.lmb.18-57-31: hmm...something here keeps beeping, and i don't know what.

.lmb.18-57-35: probably ellen's computer.

.gavinm.18-58-44: Pull the plug.  You know it makes sense.

.gavinm.19-01-47: Pekka, there'll be a review next Wednesday, taken by Richard.

.gavinm.19-01-58: You probably want to get yourself invited.

.pekka.19-02-09: Yes, definitely.

.gavinm.19-02-39: That'll be the first review in a year that I haven't taken .

.pekka.19-03-13: Do I need to read up on the process before the review?

.gavinm.19-04-25: It would help.  

.gavinm.19-04-55: You only really need to read process.review, 
proc.review.check, and guide.review.class.

.pekka.19-05-41: Yep, got it.

.gavinm.19-05-49: You might want to skim proc.review.ko, proc.review.log, and 
proc.review.brainstorm.

.gavinm.19-06-06: but they're mainly for the chairman.

.pekka.19-08-03: OK, I've put them in my bookmarks, and will read them before 
Wed.

.gavinm.19-08-43: Ok.  You should remember enough from my potted spiel.

.gavinm.19-08-58: You have copies of all these, of course, in your process 
handbook.

.pekka.19-10-55: True.  I think I ought to take my handbook home; at work I can 
always read it from Notes.

.gavinm.19-15-15: Bye.

.pekka.19-15-29: bye

.lmb.19-17-14: bye.

.lmb.21-41-04: bye.
