    gavinm: So, can we use this for revew logging?
       drj: I dunno

   Richard: David, which IRC client are you using?
   Richard: It makes quite a lot of difference which terminal you use.
   Richard: Also, it won't be much good unless you have more than one window.
       drj: I am using a client called irc
   Richard: Not ircII?
       drj: I have more than one window now.  Exciting huh?
       drj: I don't know if it is ircII or not.  Looks like it, but then I am 
sure I used ircII before and it was better than this
   Richard: It doesn't look like ircII.  You need to get it from somewhere.
*** ptw has set the topic on channel #mm to IS IRC useful for anything
       ptw: The question is, did he mean to do that?
       drj: er... This is a trick question right?
   Richard: Tucker and I used to have some quite useful conversations using IRC
       ptw: No, rhetorical.  An admission that I don't know how to use IRC very 
well.
            ptw tries to figure out what this button does
       drj: Do you know a language called "icon" Tucker?
       ptw: I have downloaded something that purports to run it
       ptw: That's the limit of my knowleged
       drj: I mention it because its "compiler" is sufficiently dumb that the 
standard book on the language keeps mentioning all sorts of things you 
shouldn't do because the compiler is too stupid to optimise them.
   Richard: Tucker, I'm just sorting through the piles on my desk and will post 
the C/C++ Users' Journal article to you.
       ptw: What is the standard book on Icon?
   Richard: An installer on Gavin's PC just told him to "disconnect from the 
Internet"
       ptw: Are you suggesting this would be a source of examples for the GC 
book?
       drj: "The Icon Programming Language" by Griswold and Griswold.  I am 
learning icon from it ATM
       drj: Well, perhaps.  An example is...
       ptw: What got you into Icon?
       drj: while(upto(&letters ++ &digits))
       drj: you're recommended not to do that because &letters ++ &digits 
conses each time round the loop.  It is a constant expression, so this is a bit 
braindead
       drj: er, dunno really.  Probably learning about lcc (the code generator 
generator was originally written in icon)
       ptw: lcc?
       ptw: Why do I keep getting "-deja-vu.long.harlequin.co.uk-" in my window?
       drj: Local C Compiler.  An ANSI C compiler developed at princeton  
http://www.cs.princeton.edu/software/lcc/index.html       drj: has the goals of 
being maintainable, portable, and fast to compile.
       ptw: Ah, and this is one that we compile against, to help ensure 
portability of our own code.
       drj: hmm.  except that only drj has access to lcc.  I should fix that 
sometime.
       ptw: Can you jot down the examples you come upon that strike you as 
potential book material and email them off to me?
       drj: yep
   Richard: The photocopier is broken so I guess I'll have to mail you the 
articles tomorrow.
   Richard: However, two of them are about benchmarking allocation.
   Richard: I am going home but I will connect from there.

11:00 BST; report meeting at 1997-05-21 16:00 BST?
       drj: tick
    gavinm: tock
       ptw: I prefer 16:00 for my kickoff
       drj: is there a ten-pin bowling alley in Boston? (is this a dumb 
question?)
*** Richard (richard@dynamic4.cam.harlequin.co.uk) has joined channel #mm
   Richard: Hello again.
       drj: 'lo richard
       ptw: hi
       ptw: Gee, I just realized, running IRC seems to keep my phone off the 
hook...
       ptw: Not sure that is a good thing
   Richard: I have to try out this new HOPE client for Larry on my Power Mac.
   Richard: So, if I leave suddenly you'll know what caused it.
   Richard: Tucker, I think those -deja-vu...- messages are PINGs fr the server.
       ptw: Probably what is keeping my phone off the hook.
       ptw: I just got: *** CTCP: Richard sent a command: PING
   Richard: Just testing.
       ptw: What does that mean?
   Richard: It means I typed /ctcp ptw ping, which means client-to-client 
protocol, ping ptw's client from mine.
   Richard: Arooga, arooga, launching HOPE client...
   Richard: OK, you can stop holding your breath now.
   Richard: So, Tucker, I think we should be able to have an installation of 
the MPS where no invalid references will arise.  In those cases, we want to 
prevent them from coming out of the buffer protocol.
   Richard: But I need to check my facts.
   Richard: The new HOPE client uses Internet Config to set the file types and 
creators correctly.
   Richard: Only Internet explorer has decided that _it_ wants to own .c files, 
thank you very much.
       drj: there are ways with coping with the "invalid references" arising 
from some particular buffer protocol, basically by relying onthe fact that they 
will be of a particular form.  So why do we want to prevent them?
   Richard: drj: How do you cope with my example of the three pairs and the two 
triples?
       drj: can you precis the example here in two lines?  if not I'll go and 
dearchive the message
   Richard: By the time we get to I=A you can't tell these bad references from 
any other, unless you're prepared to slap special conditions on buffered 
segments (which is a possibility).
   Richard: Er, allocate three pairs and create references to them, fail to 
commit, then allocate two triples instead.  The references to pairs are bogus.
       drj: yes I see.
       drj: simply don't reuse buffered memory until all bogus pointers to it 
have been removed.  It is possible to keep track of all regions that could be 
the destinations of bogus pointers.  delete bogus pointers when found during 
scanning.
       drj: becomes simpler if you restrict the client to storing 
"protopointers" (to coin a phrase, hopefully obvious) in roots
   Richard: Sounds more complex than necessary.
       drj: (which was one of the questions that rit asked IIRC).  perhaps 
you'd want to let the client to store proto-pointers in proto-objects as well
       drj: I am inclined to agree.
   Richard: Bogus pointers never occur in the MLWorks collector, btw.
   Richard: (Or rather, we never get bad pointers into the heap.)
   Richard: (Unless there's a bug somewhere, of course.)
       drj: the allocation protocol is synchronous, the compiler doesn't have 
aggressive stackization of heap objects.
   Richard: Of course, an _ambiguous_ bogus reference is to be expected.  I 
guess we should define the protocol with reference ranks in mind.
   Richard: (FWIW, I am logging this conversation.)
       drj: well, really we are talking about the nature of exact references, 
and exactly when they created by the mutator
       drj: er, s/created/can be &/
   Richard: I agree.  We should make that clear in the spec. that rit is 
evolving.
   Richard: So much mail, so little time...
   Richard: #Hmmm, delegation.  Mmmm, delegation.  Aha, delegation, that's what 
you need.#
            Richard plays trumpet
   Richard: Too obscure for Tucker, I suspect.
   Richard: Tucker, did I mention that I found out that I'm the oldest son of 
the oldest son, etc. back to Robert de Brooksby (c.1400)?  It's possible I'm 
the only one allowed to bear the escutcheon.
   Richard: (Actually, I'm the oldest son of the oldest son who has surviving 
descendents, etc.  There must be a name for that.)
       drj: er, and your dad and grandad presumably
   Richard: Oh no.  I defeated them in mortol combat.
       drj: oh, _that's_ what you were doing on Saturday
   Richard: Charee-May disapproves of my Mac desktop pattern.
   Richard: Charee-May says: You lot are supposed to be working.
       drj: I am.  I made an audio clip of me saying "lunch is here" today
   Richard: And how does that contribute to our net after-tax profits?
   Richard: Can you get a clip of Maureen saying it?
   Richard: Charee-May asks if you want anything from Sainsbury's.
       drj: well, I get to save .5 seconds every day buy automatically deleting 
one mail message per day.  Shouldn't be long before we're in the red
   Richard: Well, the HOPE client hasn't crashed yet.
       drj: Mmm.  A ciabatta or some sort of french stick thing please
   Richard: Charee-May says OK, she'll get one.
   Richard: Is that an olive ciabatta or a plain one?
       drj: my eating habits go on the log
       drj: don't care
   Richard: Ooo.  Technote 1061 describes the Open Firmware interface, Forth, 
etc.
       drj: Ooo.  Just had doubts about the new proposal for the buffered alloc 
protocol.
       drj: it works by the client deleting any bogus references after the test 
of limit, but before the call to trip right?
       drj: they might still get scanned; is the idea that this is okay, 
because {insert obscure reason here}?
   Richard: I think that's what we discussed.
   Richard: Obscure reason = it's initialized by then.
       drj: it?  the object being allocated?  yes, but it might not be 
scannable.
    gavinm: "I prefer 16:00 for my kickoff" -- OK
   Richard: drj: why not?
       drj: I suppose it's copyable (not if the wrapper is out-of-epoch), but 
it all seems a bit fragile
   Richard: gavinm: Eh?
       drj: 'cause it might be full of pointers to some ancient epoch
   Richard: Oh, it won't get scanned if the flip was before I=A, but it might 
if it's after.
   Richard: Because flip copies I to S, etc.
       drj: BUS ERROR drj is evacuated, yes.  I grok that.  We still have to 
cope with pointers to it though, until the call to trip
   Richard: It shouldn't be copied if S points at it.  That's a special test in 
fix we have to add.
   Richard: (As Tucker pointed out in mail.)
    gavinm: "(FWIW, I am logging this conversation.)" -- me too.
   Richard: Gavin, are you in a time warp?
    gavinm: No, I'm just catching up.
    gavinm: I've been to feed the printer.
    gavinm: Regarding the pings, I believe I can alter the frequency.  Would 
IRC work if your phone idn't stay off-hook?
   Richard: I'm not sure Tucker is listening.

   Richard: Quite the most exciting web site you'll ever see, I'm sure you'll 
agree.
    gavinm: You've put me in again.
   Richard: Don't worry, it's only a local directory.
   Richard: hang on...
   Richard: Why are you such a recluse anyway?
   Richard: Try again.  You should've gone.
    gavinm: I don't want to be indexed as a broken page.
   Richard: OK.  I've fixed it at demon too.
    gavinm: There's a problem with our all leaving an IRC session running.
    gavinm: People don't know whether we'll respond quickly or not.
    gavinm: In my (limited) experience, IRC channels tend to become two (or 
more) interleaved conversations between the same people.
    gavinm: I can't type very fast because this IRC client loses characters.
*** gavinm is now known as GavinM
    GavinM: Ah.  Notes just failed to print a(n unspecified) document because 
of "insufficient memory".  It is proceeding with printing.
    GavinM: No it isn't.
    GavinM: Well, I've raised Notes' memory to 10M, and I'll try again.
   Richard: Give it 100Mb.  Why not?
    GavinM: I will next time it breaks.
   Richard: I'm hanging up.  Bye!

       ptw: " Would IRC work if your phone idn't stay off-hook?"
       ptw: That's what I'd like to find out.
       ptw: But as long as you keep pinging me, I believe my phone will 
       ptw: not go on hook, unless I go to the cellar and unplug it.
    GavinM: Let's try.  I'll just find thedocumentation.
       ptw: I thought there was some tweak where IRC could tell you that I was 
idle or aways
    GavinM: I've changed the ping from 90 seconds to 600.
    GavinM: The /away command does that.  I thought you used it earlier.
       ptw: I did, but IWBNI it were more automatic.
       ptw: I will be quiet now, and see if my phone hangs up.
    GavinM: Say, if it printed a message if a user hadn't "seen" or "used" the 
IRC window in N seconds.
