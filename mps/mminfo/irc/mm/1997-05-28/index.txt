.sheep.09-59-46: hello everyone ! 

.richard.10-00-22: Hello?

.sheep.10-00-37: hi Richard - how's it going 

.sheep.10-00-42: ?

.richard.10-01-00: Oh, hi.  I heard someone turn up.

.sheep.10-01-19: have you got you mac on speak mode or something ? 

.richard.10-01-25: My tamagotchi has just mutated.  I have the optimal creature.

.richard.10-01-31: No, I heard Gavin's mac beep.

.richard.10-01-40: Leah (our doc) is here.  She hasn't met you.

.sheep.10-01-52: hi Leah !

.richard.10-01-59: Are you coming here tomorrow for a bit?  I will be busy (as 
usual) but we can talk.  And you can meet Leah.

.richard.10-02-02: Leah says Hi.

.sheep.10-02-29: Yep having missed monday I think it's important to get over at 
least once a week.

.richard.10-02-41: OK, we'll see you tomorrow.

.sheep.10-02-47: I will certainly be around tommorow afternoon (?)

.richard.10-02-55: Don't forget to bring Symantec Cafe and Visio across.

.sheep.10-03-43: If you guys with NT examine your programs/admin/performace 
monitor I think you will find

.sheep.10-04-33: that there is a nice program which could suggest many ways to 
give Ironbox a look and feel

.sheep.10-04-47: I'll certainly bring Symantec Cafe too !

.richard.10-05-00: (I think I'm the only one listening here at the moment.)

.richard.10-05-16: I will look forward to seeing your Java prototype.  I'd 
quite like to run it on my Mac using Codewarrior too.

.sheep.10-05-20: Daivd is over here with me(talk about stack frames).

.richard.10-05-35: But where is his IRC session?

.sheep.10-05-52: He's still sorting out somewhere to work.

.richard.10-06-19: Ah.

.richard.10-06-36: I'd better get on with this meeting with Leah.  /msg me if 
you need something (or phone).  Talk to you later.

.sheep.10-07-10: Good, speek to you later (goes off looking for tea). 

.gavinm.10-07-53: Hello.

.sheep.10-17-28: hi Gavin

.sheep.10-43-36: ACTION arives back drinking tea

.gavinm.10-50-15: ACTION goes for another coffee.

.gavinm.10-57-19: ACTION sips his cappuccino.

.lmb.10-59-52: hullo, all.

.gavinm.11-00-04: Hello Leah.  Have you met Sheep?

.sheep.11-00-13: Hi Leah

.lmb.11-00-23: not in person.  we spoke on irc via richard earlier.

.sheep.11-00-48: What have you been speaking to Richard about ? 

.lmb.11-01-20: interface conventions, mostly, and how to get a reference manual 
out by the end of june.

.gavinm.11-01-24: Is David there?

.sheep.11-02-04: yes daivd is here next to me 

.gavinm.11-02-16: Apparently lunch is here.

.lmb.11-02-18: no, he's been idle for 18 hours.

.richard.11-02-37: David, I have the optimal tamagotchi.

.sheep.11-03-11: David: wow

.sheep.11-03-30: so what's for lunch ? 

.gavinm.11-03-37: All this fuss over a key fob.

.lmb.11-03-40: ACTION thinks which tamagotchi you get is partly genetic

.lmb.11-06-04: but i could be wrong.

.gavinm.11-06-40: Heredity or Environment: The Tamagotchi scientists are still 
arguing.

.gavinm.11-07-05: ACTION , unlike David, hasn't given up sarcasm.

.richard.11-17-57: Hmmm.  Rhapsody will support full 4.4BSD as well as NeXT and 
MacOS.

.richard.11-18-44: Unfortunately, the developer release will only work on 8500 
and 8600, and maybe 9500 and 9600.  What about my 7500?

.gavinm.11-24-09: Remind me what all these numbers mean.  I don't have Apple 
product codes memorised.

.richard.11-28-39: I don't really know what they mean.  All I know is that I 
have a 7500 and isn't in the set of platforms.

.sheep.11-32-20: the 7500 runs at 100Mhz and has a PCI slot (as do the others) 
I suspect that the whole thing

.sheep.11-32-47: is being targeted at the PowerPC market (non mac). 

.sheep.11-33-19: I run the next step quite happily on a Cube with 8mb of Ram 
and a 68040 processor. 

.sheep.11-34-16: Appart from speed I don't see why it should not run on the 
7500 (no low level changes where made on the 8500...)

.sheep.11-34-42: ACTION leaves so can reinstall big reable fonts on to the 
system

.sheep.11-34-56: Hi Bronze who are you ? 

.bronze.11-35-03: I am drj in disguise

.bronze.11-35-18: th other drj is marked as away

.sheep.11-35-47: more methods to keep the room quiet

.gavinm.11-39-40: Now all you need is an anti-noise generator.

.sheep.11-40-17: ACTION really really leaves to restart machine

.sheep.12-00-49: hi

.sheep.12-06-35: ACTION back agin

.lmb.12-14-06: how did you choose bronze as a nick?

.bronze.12-15-19: I guessed

.lmb.12-16-08: eh?

.richard.12-27-49: Sheep?

.gavinm.12-29-51: Hey!  Instead of all this fuss with assertion ids, we should 
just write the product so that it never goes wrong

.gavinm.12-32-15: More seriously, in VMS, all messages are tagged 
"<program>-<class>-<name>", where program is some allocated name for the 
executable, class is a letter indicating Informational, Warning, or Error, and 
name is a mnemonic chosen by the programmer.

.gavinm.12-33-11: E.g. %AGA-E-COND  Non-logical used in conditional context.

.gavinm.12-34-38: %FOLDPROC-W-SCREEN  Fold exceeds screen size.

.bronze.12-35-53: what it is opposite of pathology?

.sheep.12-36-21: Well a good user interface should have the thinest of documents

.gavinm.12-36-25: bathology

.sheep.12-37-06: I like Richards idear of hand tagging all asserts - By keeping 
things electronically 

.sheep.12-37-21: should be possible to have on-line help at the same time.

.sheep.12-37-56: As far as errors go I'm thinking of having a lifeboat (gui 
version of soft core dump).

.sheep.12-38-15: Java can give the user a full stack trace. 

.gavinm.12-39-38: Pathology is the study of the effects of disease or abnormal 
conditions, from pathos, that which inspires pity.

.bronze.12-39-54: and bathology?

.gavinm.12-40-09: Bathos is a ridiculous descent from the elegant to the coarse.

.bronze.12-40-31: is this sarcasm then?

.gavinm.12-40-45: Who me?  Never.

.bronze.12-40-49: Idon't understand how bathos is opposite of pathos

.gavinm.12-41-45: Physiology is the study of the process of life.

.gavinm.12-42-18: What's the opposite of pity?

.bronze.12-42-41: I want to say: "In the <non-pathological> case the following 
condition on two adjacent stack frames holds: blah blah"

.bronze.12-42-53: "The following pathological cases can occur in which case, 
blah blah blah

.bronze.12-43-00: .".

.gavinm.12-43-37: Normal?  Common?

.gavinm.12-43-49: Typical?  

.bronze.12-44-18: normal I am using at the moment, but it seems so feeble.

.gavinm.12-45-02: How about, "Under normalcy"; that's sure to reboot their 
parser.

.gavinm.12-47-00: If you're striving for precision, you can't make statements 
about non-pathological cases without reference to a definition of what counts 
as pathological.  How about "Except in the pathalogical cases specified below,"?

.gavinm.12-47-26: e-3/a/o/

.bronze.12-52-47: what bizarre syntax your editor has

.gavinm.12-54-55: Zed

.bronze.12-55-13: that ain't zed

.bronze.12-55-30: e3l/a/o

.bronze.12-55-34: perhaps

.gavinm.12-55-55: Ah.

.sheep.13-03-35: ACTION interjects

.sheep.13-04-05: hay does anyone know if HQin Dylan will read unsigned binary 
ints ? 

.bronze.13-04-44: urrh.  I would hope so.

.bronze.13-05-06: did you see the mail message a couple of weeks ago about 
previewing the draft dylan doc which included doc about the IO library IIRC?

.lmb.13-06-28: if you didn't, but want to see it anyway, go into HOPE and look 
through the DOCdylan hierarchy.

.bronze.13-06-48: more usefully, it as on the web, but I can't recall the URL.  
lmb?

.sheep.13-08-02: I printed out a copy of the draft dylan doc - I can't see it 
in there.

.sheep.13-08-32: I still don't know how to use HOPE.

.gavinm.13-09-05: It's reasonably well-documented in a component-based sort of 
way.

.sheep.13-09-39: I was promised a one day hope training session 

.sheep.13-09-54: not to mention a one day NOTES training session ? 

.gavinm.13-10-47: I think we were all promised a Notes 4 training session.  I 
was also promised a preview of the Notes 4 client.

.bronze.13-15-12: how much exerience does our manager need?

.bronze.13-15-30: I mean experience of management.

.gavinm.13-16-11: Strictly, he needs ability.

.richard.13-17-29: I'd like someone reasonably experienced.  It took me a long 
time to learn how to do it.

.richard.13-17-33: Do you have someone in mind?

.richard.13-17-53: I'd like to know that the manager has managed several 
conflicting projects at once before.

.bronze.13-18-02: perhaps.  they aren't at all experienced in mangement, but 
they have a degree in it

.richard.13-18-12: Send 'em in.

.bronze.13-18-25: I see. pretty damn experienced them.  I can see why we're not 
getting it.

.bronze.13-18-31: what's our budget for the manager?

.bronze.13-18-34: hahahaha

.richard.13-18-43: Actually, someone fresh would be OK because we can train 
them to be on "our" side.

.richard.13-18-55: Budget?

.richard.13-19-22: I guess that'd be discussed by HR with the person.  I can't 
say.  I don't control any money.

.richard.13-20-28: ACTION returns to working with Leah

.sheep.13-23-48: ACTION returns from doing some reading outside.

.sheep.13-23-58: hay it's a wonderful day outside !!!

.bronze.13-30-22: so it is

.gavinm.13-30-34: It's too bright.

.sheep.13-36-20: hang on I'll find the control to turn the sun down. 

.gavinm.13-38-13: What's its X resource?

.sheep.13-38-53: Apparently sun sold out to Microsoft

.sheep.13-39-50: The Microsoft Sun(tm) will be converted to run NT not Fusion

.bronze.13-40-20: The world will never be the same again

.sheep.13-44-05: I seem to have problems finding impl.h.event and impl.c.event 
in Notes ?

.gavinm.13-46-31: Sheep, yes.  The impl.* documents reflect ones that exist 
elsewhere.  This reflection is populated manually when required, generally for 
review.

.gavinm.13-47-23: Try moving into a clean directory and typing: hope co 
-compound MMsrc

.gavinm.13-47-49: A less clean solution is to look in /u/mm/Projects/mm/src on 
deja-vu.

.sheep.13-48-14: OK I'll give that a go. 

.sheep.13-50-37: looks like something is working 

.sheep.13-56-58: has any one got richards lumberJack.c code avaible ? 

.sheep.13-57-21: could anyone post it to me ?

.sheep.13-57-47: I'm trying to convert the code to read binary event files to 
Java

.lmb.14-10-08: /msg bronze ah.  i thought so.

.lmb.14-10-24: oops.  wonder how that happened.

.bronze.14-10-36: control-B ?

.bronze.14-10-50: nah, must be some other control

.gavinm.14-10-50: LMB, Perhaps you typed a space first.

.gavinm.14-10-59: Or OPTION-I.

.richard.14-11-11: David, how are things going with JonT and MM/ML?

.bronze.14-11-45: richard.  I spent all my time up till now drawing an accurate 
picture of what happens during a disturb

.richard.14-12-06: Good idea.  Keep the picture.  We can put it in 
design.ml.whatever.

.bronze.14-12-15: Now have several ideas about how to solve the problems

.richard.14-12-28: Have you managed to generate any problems yet?

.bronze.14-12-32: will be working with Jon tomorrow plugging my code into an 
interctive ML system

.richard.14-12-46: OK.  Where do you intend to be tomorrow?

.bronze.14-12-51: no.  Jon doesn't have an interactive system yet.

.bronze.14-12-58: at Jon's house.

.richard.14-13-14: You might be able to generate problems without an 
interactive system.  Just write some code into a file and compile it to an mo.

.richard.14-13-38: You'll need something that stack extends and passes 
arguments on the stack, if I understand correctly.

.bronze.14-14-11: indeed.  or has an asynchronous event happening

.richard.14-14-38: Right.  If you can find out when arguments get stacked, then 
you should be able to write something deeply recursive that goes wrong nicely.

.bronze.14-15-12: unfortunately, the batch compiler is on Jon's PC at his home 
because that's the only one that runs linux, because <insert braindead 
reasonhere>

.richard.14-15-27: e.g.  fun f (a,b,c,d) = if a = 0 then a+b+c+d else 1 + 
f(a-1, b, c, d)

.richard.14-15-50: then do f(1000, 10, 20, 30) and see what you get out.

.bronze.14-15-53: er, tail recursion?

.bronze.14-16-13: f(b, c, d, a-1) might be more amusing

.gavinm.14-20-02: Jets are noisy today.

.richard.14-20-35: Two fighters one minute ago.

.richard.14-20-39: One more 10 secs ago.

.bronze.14-20-51: here come the warm jets

.richard.14-21-16: One more.

.sheep.14-21-30: Richard I'm having problems checking out lumberjack.c is hope 
very case sensitive ?

.richard.14-22-58: Hope is case sensetive.

.lmb.14-23-56: some almost-public gossip:  sonya is taking a 12-week leave of 
absence this summer.

.lmb.14-24-24: sorry about the ^A.  you can use Emacs commands on UNIX irc 
clients.

.sheep.14-24-46: so how do you spell lumber jack with case ?

.richard.14-24-50: Sheep: Get David to give you a hand.

.richard.14-24-56: lumberjack.c and events.h

.richard.14-25-02: I don't use case in file names.

.bronze.14-25-02: oh wow, ^A, ^F, ^E, what a revelation.

.richard.14-25-45: Are you in the right compound?  You need to check out from 
MMusers_richard.

.richard.14-26-05: Try "co -comp MMusers_richard -branch . lumberjack.c -and 
events.h"

.richard.14-26-09: That ought to do it.

.sheep.14-27-46: I got it hurhay !!!! 

.bronze.14-28-31: is she writing another book

.bronze.14-28-32: ?

.bronze.14-28-40: mind you, 12 weeks aint long to write a book

.lmb.14-29-02: no, she's just goofing off.  i think she's burnt out after 15 
years or so of technical authoring.

.lmb.14-29-16: danielle steele writes books in two weeks.

.richard.15-12-15: De Bono wrote a book on a 2 hour plane journey recently.

.bronze.15-12-48: and he's got a doctorate from cambridge

.bronze.15-33-19: oops.  I was giving up sarcasm wasn't I?

.lmb.15-39-46: iirc, yes.

.gavinm.15-44-38: Was that sarcasm?

.bronze.15-45-10: I dunno.  I've forgotten what other forms of speech are 
called.

.gavinm.16-21-01: Just me here now.

.bronze.16-23-40: and me

.bronze.16-23-43: though I am leaving soon

.gavinm.16-34-14: I think our door needs rehung.

.gavinm.16-34-27: It couldn't be anything do to with the wedge.

.bronze.16-35-10: bye all

.gavinm.16-35-10: Hello.

.ptw.16-35-33: Hiya.  Who/at is Bronze?

.gavinm.16-36-08: That was DRJ at the Hall.

.gavinm.17-29-59: By the way, both Leah and DRJ bowed out of the Edit Session, 
leaving just me.

.gavinm.17-30-03: I decided to cancel.

.ptw.17-40-53: Guess work got in the way.

.gavinm.17-41-46: I'm trying to put Norton's Speed Disk on a boot floppy

.gavinm.17-41-59: but there doesn't seem to be room.  Is this possible?

.gavinm.18-08-17: Never mind.  I'm off.

.gavinm.18-08-51: Bye.
