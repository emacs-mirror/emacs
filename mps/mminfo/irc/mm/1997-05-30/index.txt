.gavinm.13-53-56: Afternoon.

.gavinm.14-47-10: Hot, isn't it?

.ptw.15-29-24: Not too bad here.

.ptw.15-30-44: One thing about IRC, could be good or bad, I don't get told when 
folks are chattering away but I have its window buried

.gavinm.15-37-19: That's a client issue.  My NT client manages to highlight the 
tab on the taskbar.

.gavinm.15-40-10: Fortunately, we weren't.

.gavinm.16-32-54: We were having a design brainstorm (see Richard's mail) and 
excluding you as usual.

.gavinm.17-16-47: What do you think about Richard's idea of removing all 
Describe mthods?  I'm in two minds about it.

.gavinm.17-25-05: And what am I supposed to do with this Appleshare thing?  
Does that give me Appletalk over IP?

.gavinm.17-52-56: I see what you mean about not realising when people are 
chattering away.

.ptw.18-00-52: I'm awake now!

.ptw.18-01-33: IRC really ought to update your idle time.  I was at my Friday 
`lesson'.

.ptw.18-02-07: AppleShare:  Yes!  Apple have finally realized that the whole 
world is not on AppleTalk

.ptw.18-02-21: Nor do they gateway Ethertalk

.ptw.18-02-58: Hence, they have finally decided to provide the various Apple 
proprietary protocols over TCP/IP

.ptw.18-03-34: It would let any of us see Hqn's AppleTalk files/printers/etc. 
when connected by PPP.

.ptw.18-04-18: There is a client that replaces your current AppleTalk control 
panel that simply adds TCP/IP to the current choice of AppleTalk or EtherTalk

.ptw.18-05-03: The server is big $ and only runs on Apple servers (so far).  
E.g., sysadmins ploy to 

.ptw.18-05-27: provide Apple File services from NT could not participate in 
this scheme (until Micro$

.ptw.18-05-52: decide to add AFS/IP support to NT).

.gavinm.18-36-16: Back.

.gavinm.18-37-28: Ah.  So it's not actually any use to me.  Er, can two clients 
talk?

.gavinm.18-38-08: Does it avoid the AppleTalk's annoying problem of switching 
from Ethernet to Modem Port every time I undock?

.gavinm.19-06-17: Bye.
