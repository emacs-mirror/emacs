.meaning: A "draft" document has been completed by the author, complete, but 
has not yet been reviewed and accepted (cf. status.accepted).  Its contents may 
therefore be unreliable.  In particular, it has an undefined number of defects, 
whereas an accepted document has an estimate of the number of defects based on 
review experience.

.use: Mark a document as draft when it is essentially complete and can be used 
as a source of information.

.rule.source: A draft document can be used as a source of information, but 
anything produced from the information must be marked as being produced from 
draft documents.

.rule.quote: The tag of a draft document can be quoted, because the tag 
shouldn't change.

.rule.tag: The tag of a draft document should not be changed without informing 
everyone who might know about the document and searching for cross references 
in other documents.
