1. Correct logged issues according to your sources and rules.

2. If, in your opinion, a logged issue is due to, or first requires correction 
of a source, rule, or checklist, then write a Change Request to the owner of 
the source document.

3. Insert a note in your candidate document about the pending Change Request 
you sent.

4. You may, if you wish, make annotation or written answers in your product to 
any 'questions of intent' which were logged.  This will answer questions from 
future readers for you in advance.

5. You may change a severity (major, minor) classification to one which you 
believe is more correct than originally logged.  Change the final count 
appropriately.

6. Indicate on the log how and where you have edited for each issue, so as to 
make the leader's follow-up process obvious and easy.

7. You do not need to respond to an issue in the way indicated by the 
checkers.  Fix the real issue in a responsible way.  An issue becomes a defect 
only when you acknowledge it by making a correction.

8. You may make corrections to defects which you spot yourself during editing 
work.  Include them in your defect count.

9. Your may make improvements and optimizations to your document without 
counting them as defects, but take great care as these changes will not have 
been Inspected.  Inform the Inspection leader about any additional changes you 
have made.
