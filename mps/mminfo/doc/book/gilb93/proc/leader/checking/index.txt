1. Check novices after a while to make sure they are finding issues.
2. Help them to learn to find issues if they have trouble.
3. Check for issues yourself only if you deem it the best use of your time for
   the team results, otherwise concentrate on managing the team.
4. Be available to any team member needing help.
5. Check that checkers have really had time to check at the optimum rate.  If
   necessary consider delaying the planed logging meeting to allow time for all
   checkers to do their job.
