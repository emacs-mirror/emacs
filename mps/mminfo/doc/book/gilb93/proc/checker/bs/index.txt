1. When the leader suggests a defect to be analyzed, find it in your 
documentation as quickly as possible and confirm that you have found it.

2. Help to brainstorm the defect cause classification (communication, 
oversight, transmission, education).

3. Brainstorm keywords about the root cause.  (Do not use more than one minute 
as a team for this.  You can contribute several conflicting ideas.)

4. Brainstorm keywords about a suggested process cure which would prevent such 
errors happening in the future.  One minute maximum for the team.

5. Do not try to get the whole truth.  You do not have time.  The Process 
Change Management Team will study this in more depth later.
