.PROJECT: The document (code) must meet all relevant project requirements.

.UNCONFINED: The code should confine itself to the problem at hand, as defined 
in the mod header, problem report, or design document.

.REGRESSION: The code should introduce no regressions in performance, 
functionality, or other qualities, except as noted in the mod header and other 
accompanying documentation.

.INCOMPATIBLE: The code should not introduce incompatibilities with other 
systems, e.g. create a library dependency.  Where this is unavoidable, the 
situation must be clearly documented in the mode header or other acompanying 
documentation.

.HARD-CODED: The code should use symbolic constraints, instead of hard-coded 
values, whenever appropriate.

.INTERFACE: Module preambles should describe the interface between the module 
and the "outside world".  The preamble should describe entry and exit 
conditions and a statement of the module's purpose.  The preamble should 
include any orientation necessary for understanding the module as a whole.

.COMPLEXITY: The level of commentary should match the complexity of the code.  
Explanatory text should be complete and relevant.

.STYLE: For mods, the coding style should match that of the surrounding code.  
The author may use differing styles where he or she deems appropriate.
