JUST: The requirement justification for each solution or hierarchical set of 
solutions must always be indicated, with the solution specification itself 
using tags of requirements (this is the specific equivalent of 
rule.generic.source).  For example: Strategy-X: Hire a new chairman <- 
{req.profit-1, req.growth-2}.

IMPACT: A numeric quality estimation table with evidence shall accompany all 
solution specifications, so that we have the designer's opinion of how all 
attributes are impacted by all solutions.
