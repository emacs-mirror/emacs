1. All "documents" costing over one work-hour to produce, or which affect more 
than one work-week of cost, shall be "exited" correctly from Inspection before 
further use.

2. All paperwork processes shall be defined by written "owned" rules and 
procedures, entry criteria, and exit criteria.

3. Default exit condition for maximum remaining major defects per page is three 
(for this year) and 0.3 (three years from now).

4. Optimum checking and logging meeting (including further checking) rates 
shall be determined and used.

5. Inspection team leaders will be trained (5 days) and "certified", to permit 
them to take responsibility for Inspections.  They shall then be continuously 
monitored for reasonable performance by their metrics.

6. Quality Assurance will provide all support functions for Inspection 
(training, database, audit, certification, forms, ownership of standards by 
default).

7. Defect prevention through process improvement will be given priority 
(kickoff objectives and strategies, Quality Assurance database, process 
brainstorming, Process Change Management Teams).

8. Inspection will be applied "upstream" first in development, and to 
maintenance and change control.

9. Inspection will be subject to regular, no less than annual, process audit.

10. Managers will lead by using Inspection on all their important documents 
(objectives, budgets, strategies, policies, presentations to the board and the 
like).
