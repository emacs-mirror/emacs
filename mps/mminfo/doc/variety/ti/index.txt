.use: This variety is intended for use by MM development and by internal 
customers for development, and tool use.  It is never for use by external 
customers.

.source: See design.mps.variety for more information, and an explanation of 
some of the terms used.

.desc: This variety is temporary, and is to provide telemetry in advance of 
work to support internal telemetry and controllable external telemetry.  In the 
future, it will be rolled into variety.ci.

.check: It has all available checking with switches available via a debugger.  
The current switching is analagous  to the old variety.ds, variety.dp, and 
variety.df, but this will become finer.  The current default level is analogous 
to the old variety.ds.  [This may not be true.  GavinM 1997-08-27]

.strip: It is not stripped.

.telemetry: Currently this variety has internal telemetry limited to one event, 
and switchable external telemetry, the default level being all on.
