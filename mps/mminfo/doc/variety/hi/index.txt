.use: This variety is intended for use by MM development and internal customers 
for profiling and high performance work.  It is never for use by external 
customers.

.source: See design.mps.variety for more information, and an explanation of 
some of the terms used.

.desc: This variety is intended to have as much checking and telemetry as 
possible, but with no significant performance overhead as compared to 
variety.wi.  

.slow: A "significant performance overhead" is a slow-down in the memory 
manager of more than 10% in any typical client operation.

.slow.just: The figure 10% was chosen because it is at a level that an 
interactive user would not observe. 

.check: It has a subset of checking, but is unswitchable.  

.strip: It is not stripped.

.telemetry: Currently this variety has no telemetry, but in the future it will 
have a subset of internal telemetry, but no external telemetry.

.opt: There should be no differences in compiler options from variety.wi; in 
particular, the optimisation level should be the same.
