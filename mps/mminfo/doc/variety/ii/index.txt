The I perversely stands for "ICE" (In-Ciruit-Emulation a technology used to 
attach logic probes and stuff to fabbed chips in order to debug, test, and 
inspect).

This variety has telemetry and is also red hot.  Created because variety.ti 
runs like a dog.  I imagine in the future all this will be consolidated and 
merged and the number of varieties will be reduced to sane levels.  Currently 
only implemented on UNIX.  Since we never really wanted this variety in the 
first place, let's keep it that way.
