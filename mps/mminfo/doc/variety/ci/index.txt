.use: This variety is intended for use by MM development and by internal 
customers for development.  It is never for use by external customers.

.source: See design.mps.variety for more information, and an explanation of 
some of the terms used.

.desc: This variety is intended to have all possible checking and telemetry 
(but see .telemetry) available at a controllable level, without being vastly 
slower that variety.hi by default.

.slow: "vastly slower" is a slow-down in the memory manager by more than a 
factor of three in any typical client operation.

.slow.just: The figure x3 was chosen because it is at a level that won't be 
absolutely unacceptable to a developer.

.check: It has all available checking with switches available via a debugger.  
The current switching is analagous  to the old variety.ds, variety.dp, and 
variety.df, but this will become finer.  The current default level is analogous 
to the old variety.ds.  [May not be true.  GavinM 1997-08-27]

.strip: It is not stripped.

.telemetry: Currently this variety has no telemetry, but in the future it will 
have all internal telemetry and switchable external telemetry, as for 
variety.ti, but with the default level being consistent with .desc.
