RELEASE SCHEDULE

.sched: It is intended to release this version to Dylan by 1998-08-04 Tuesday.


INTENTION

.intent: The intent of this release is as for version.dylan.crow, but including:
  - An implementation of low memory handling.  Time is short for this, so there 
is a known risk.
  - Performance improvements to the extensible arena (particularly regarding 
zone pressure and critical path).
  - Some better parameter tuning from ASG.
