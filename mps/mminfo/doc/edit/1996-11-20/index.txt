BRAINSTORM

.brainstorm.start: 17:05

1. Idea of edit session a good one, not sure why not working.  Usually consult 
on hard edits.  Suggest edits performed by teams.  Copilots.  But review by 
many, edit by one is a keystone of the review process.  New code is faster on 
own, but edits are faster with someone looking over shoulder, maybe twice as 
fast.

2. Difficult to test Describe changes.  Should be a test.  Should ensure test 
when writing code.  

3.  Edits involve many tasks.  This could would well with teams.
