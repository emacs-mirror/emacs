PROCESS BRAINSTORM

.bs.plan: 15:45

.bs.start: 15:46

.bs.issues: 

DRJ: Amount of edit needed per document.  Length of certain issues.  E.g., 
design work, locating possible uses for RING_FOR.  Changes in response to 
issues in this file may have wide-ranging effect.  

Never been in any plan.  Edit Sessions have put it into plan.

Richard: GavinM kept interrupting me.  

Rejecting a lot of issues because they are concerning documentation.  Needed to 
evolve rules for that sort of file.  Knew that there was nothing seriously 
wrong with it.  Mostly lack of clarity; not the job of this file.  PI: to have 
recognized difference and formulated rules earlier, and use them in review.  
rule.impl.h.external

Should keep track of how long things have been delayed.  Good to extend 
documents in edit mail; followup by talking to people.
