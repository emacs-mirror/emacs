.version: Update the version number in lists:version.  Add an entry on the 
news.changes page.

.generate: @@@@

.test: Run all the tests.@@@@

.qa: Install on internal server, and announce it for review on 
mm-web-discussion.  Get a QA person, if you can (possibly separate ones for Web 
tech and content).
.tar: Ideally, at the same time, generate the tar file that will be used

.go: Move the tarfile to the release directory ~mm/release/web/, with the right 
name and permissions (see previous files), and ask webmaster to install it on 
the public server.  Wait for it to be installed.  .wait.announce: While you're 
waiting, you might prepare the announcement (starting from previous 
announcements).

.check: Once the release is available on the public server, do some superficial 
checking.  Make sure webmaster is running regular checks.

.announce: Send the announcement to our mailing list (mmref-news) and to the 
appropriate fora (see previous).

.update.mmref-news: Update the info text on the mmref-news mailing list.

.logs: After release, the web logs should be examined as part of planning for 
the next phase of development.  They may well affect the requirements.
