.intro: Great Circle from Geodesic Systems is a garbage collector for C and 
C++, with advanced debugging facilities.

.web: Their website is <URL:http://www.geodesic.com/GreatCircle/>.

.overview: Great Circle (Geodesic Systems) is the first commercial product to 
offer garbage collection facilities to the C++ programmer, and is pitched as a 
memory leak _eliminator_.  "Just link your C/C++ program with Great Circle and 
all its memory leaks automatically disappear!  It's that simple.  We 
_guarantee_ it!  You won't need to change a line of your code or sacrifice 
performance."  It offers a single garbage collection policy with a flexible 
interface to C++ which gives the developer reasonable control.  It also claims 
to eliminate "hangs" (i.e. long pauses) by using an incremental garbage 
collection method.  Great Circle is available on Windows NT, Windows 95, 
Windows 3.1 (if using Win32s), and SPARC workstations (presumably SunOS and/or 
Solaris).  They are working on  OS/2, NextStep, 16-bit DOS and Windows, 32-bit 
Extended DOS, and additional Unix workstations.
