.overview: HeapAgent (MicroQuill) is dedicated heap error detection and 
diagnosis tool, the companion product to SmartHeap (rival.smartheap).  "The 
only memory-checking tool that is fast enough and unobtrusive enough to use 
every time you run your application."  MicroQuill claim that it includes 
intelligent agents that let you navigate from the point where symptoms were 
detected to the code that caused the errors.  To use HeapAgent to debug your 
application, you need to rebuild with the HeapAgent library, whereupon it 
becomes an integral part of the deployed application.
