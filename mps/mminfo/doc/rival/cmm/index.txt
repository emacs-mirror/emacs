[...] You may want to look at 
ftp.di.unipi.it:/pub/project/posso/usenixCmm.ps.gz, "A Customizable Memory 
Management Framework".  As AndyS observed, their implementation won't be very 
efficient, but the paper expresses a lot of the ideas
I'd like to see us investigate -- allowing multiple 
allocation/garbage-collection implementations to co-exist in a single framework.
