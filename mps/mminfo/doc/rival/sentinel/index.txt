Our product, SENTINEL, is a run-time memory access analyzer which is
currently available across all of the platforms that you have listed with
the exception of DEC OSF/1.  We have a port in progress for Dec OSF which
is expected to be released late 2QTR/early 3rd QTR 94.

This is the first edition of AIB Access. AIB Access is a newsletter produced
by AIB Software Corporation to provide information on currently available
AIB products, upcoming product announcements, and technical tips for using
AIB products. The distribution list for this edition consists of those
individuals who have previously requested information regarding AIB's
software products.

This edition of AIB Access includes the following topics:

o       Sentinel II(tm), with unbeatable memory access error and leak
        detection.  Sentinel II is available NOW for SunOS and Sun Solaris
        on SPARC systems and is a free upgrade for Sentinel 1.5 customers
        who are current on their maintenance.

o       Object Module Transformation(tm) technology, which enables
        Sentinel II to find memory access errors that competing products
        cannot detect in C and C++ programs.

o       Technical tip for Sentinel users: Reducing error message volume in
        Sentinelized programs.

To receive a technical overview of Sentinel II or instructions to download
an evaluation copy of Sentinel II for the Sun SPARC platform, send email

             Sentinel II Is Shipping on SunOS and Sun Solaris
__________________________________________________________________________


AIB Software Corporation announces the immediate availability of Sentinel II
on Sun SPARC systems.

Sentinel II has already made an impact on software quality. According to
Bart Schaefer, Vice President, Technology, for Network Computing Devices,
Inc., Z-Code Software Division:

        Sentinel II exceeded our expectations. The first time we used it,
        Sentinel II identified several errors that competing products did
        not detect. Superior error detection combined with the portability
        of OMT make Sentinel II a valuable tool for Z-Code Software.

Bob Keating of UGM Medical Systems, Inc., said:

        ...the cost for us to have a software defect show up at one of our
        customer sites is immeasurable. Sentinel II finds defects in our
        code which would otherwise go undetected....Sentinel II improves
        the quality and reliability of our product, and saves us money
        every time we use it!

Sentinel II is the second generation of the Sentinel multiplatform run-time
analysis tool and offers comprehensive detection of memory access errors
and leaks in C and C++ applications. It detects execution errors in global,
stack, and dynamic memory. Sentinel II precisely identifies the offending
error to the exact line of source code.

If you have access to the Internet, you can get Sentinel II today! Send email
to info@aib.com, and AIB will email you directions to download a copy of
Sentinel II for SunOS or Sun Solaris from our FTP server. If you do not have
the ability to FTP Sentinel, send email to info@aib.com and we will send you
an evaluation package.

Sentinel is currently supported on a wide range of UNIX systems:

         Sentinel II and Object Module Transformation Technology
__________________________________________________________________________


Sentinel II uses a platform-independent technology called Object Module
Transformation (OMT) to check every memory access an application performs
in user code, shared libraries, and third-party libraries. OMT involves
disassembling an object module into system-independent assembly code,
inserting error-checking instructions into the assembler code, and fully
reassembling the code. Sentinel II works at the assembler level. It controls
the generated object module and checks each instruction that accesses memory
at the point where your program accesses the memory. The result is precise
detection of memory-related errors as they occur in your code.

Send email to info@aib.com for an in-depth competitive analysis. Sentinel II
provides superior error detection when compared to other run-time analysis
tools, and network-based licensing makes Sentinel II cost-effective to
implement.

                        Sentinel II is a FREE Upgrade
__________________________________________________________________________


Are you a current Sentinel customer? If the answer is yes, and you have an
active maintenance agreement with AIB Software Corporation, you will
receive a FREE upgrade to Sentinel II.

When will you receive your free upgrade?

        You can get it now! Just send email to info@aib.com and
        request FTP instructions. Upgrade packages are currently in
        production, and we will be delivering them shortly to every
        Sentinel customer.

                         Sentinel Technical Tip
__________________________________________________________________________


Reducing Error Message Volume in Sentinelized Programs

Sometimes Sentinel does its job too well. Sentinel reports any error it
finds without discriminating between errors that are important to you
and those that are not. This sometimes leads to just too much output to
handle at one time.  AIB Software has enhanced Sentinel with
powerful filtering capabilities that enable you to focus on resolving
the most critical errors first.

Sentinel has three basic means of reducing error message volume:

o       Error detection suppression

        The following configuration options govern whether Sentinel
        performs certain error checks:

                SE_SAFE_CHECKS
                SE_WARN_BAD_PTR
                SE_WARN_COPY_UNINIT
                SE_WARN_FREE_MARK
                SE_WARN_NULL_PTR
                SE_WARN_OVERLAP
                SE_WARN_ZERO_ALLOC
                SE_WARN_ZERO_BYTE

        By altering the values of these options, you can selectively govern
        the error-checking Sentinel performs. See the Sentinel User's
        manual for full details.

o       Error reporting suppression

        The SE_EXCLUDE configuration option tells Sentinel not to report
        certain errors to you. You use this option to tell Sentinel which
errors
        are not important to you. The Sentinel User's manual has a lengthy
        discussion of SE_EXCLUDE and how you can apply it to your
        program.

        A common request is to suppress all messages coming from libXm,
        the Motif library. You can use SE_EXCLUDE=*:*/Xm*/* to
        accomplish this. Be aware, however, that this exclusion is so
        generic that you will also mask any errors that you are causing by
        passing bad data into this library. In general, the more specific you
        can make your exclusions, the less risk you run of unintentionally
        suppressing critical errors.

o       Error duplication suppression

        The SE_WARN_ONCE configuration option governs Sentinel
        behavior in the face of multiple errors from the same location in
        your program. The default value, full, causes Sentinel to report
        an error from a location only once. In this case, two errors have
        the same location if their stack contexts match exactly. If you are
        receiving multiple errors from the same location because your
        program is calling the routine with the error from differing
        locations (i.e., from slightly different stack contexts), try
        setting the value to line, which instructs Sentinel to warn
        about an error from the same line of code only once, regardless
        of stack context. We recommend that you set SE_WARN_ONCE
        to 1 (line) or 2.

        The SE_REWARN configuration option governs whether Sentinel
        warns about every error associated with a dynamically allocated
        data area. A frequent error is to allocate too little space for a data
        area. One warning that you have exceeded the bounds of this area
        is sufficient; you do not need to know every time this happens.
        In Sentinel 1.5, you can turn off this option to suppress multiple
        warnings. In Sentinel II, you should leave the value on.
