This is an experimental copying collector designed for C++.  It is described in 
paper.bartlett88, paper.bartlett89 and book.jones96 chapter 9.3 (see also 
rival.mcc).

A version of the collector for various C++ compilers (at least g++, DEC C++ on 
Ultrix, OSF/1, and some Sun OS) is available, under what looks like a 
"copyleft" (you agree to return any bug fixes and improvements to DEC) at 
<URL:ftp://ftp.digital.com/pub/DEC/CCgc/>.

Configura is trying to use this on Windows.  I think there are other users, or 
at least people using a the same algorithm.

[needs some opinions on the approach]
