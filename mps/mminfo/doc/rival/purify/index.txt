-------------------------------------
Thanks for asking about Pure Software's products. Here's a little more
information on our products: Purify, Quantify, PureLink and PureCoverage. 
Let me know if I can help out with anything else.

                       --------------------------
                             *** Purify 3.0 ***
                       --------------------------

Winner of Unix Review's Outstanding Product, Sun World's Best Product and 
Computer Language's Jolt Awards!

**COMPLETE RUN-TIME ERROR DETECTION**

o Identifies hidden execution errors and memory leaks everywhere they occur.
o Enables developers to eliminate run-time problems before they reach the
  end-user.
o Increases performance by identifying resource limiting memory leaks.

New Features in Purify 3.0:

o Intuitive Graphical User Interface
o Outline view for efficent error message browsing
o Color support for identifying critical errors quickly
o Point-and-click access to source
o GUI access to runtime options and suppressions
o Tightly integrated with PureCoverage

Purify is the only product available that has the unique ability to detect
run-time errors throughout an entire application. By verifying the correctness
of every memory access made by a program, even in shared or third-party
libraries, Purify can detect errors before they occur and provide detailed
diagnostic messages that allow you to track and eliminate these errors.
Purify's innovative patented technology, Object Code Insertion (OCI),
gives Purify the power to go well beyond the error detection of ordinary
malloc-debug packages.

Purify supports:

  - Sun SPARC Workstations running SunOS4
  - Sun SPARC Workstations running Solaris 2.X
  - HP9000 Series 700 workstations running HP-UX 8.07 or higher
  - HP9000 Series 800 workstations running HP-UX 9.0 and above

                       --------------------------
                            *** Quantify ***
                       --------------------------

Winner of UnixWorld's Best Product Award 1994!

**AVOID PERFORMANCE BOTTLENECKS**

o Reduce the risk of introducing performance bottlenecks throughout 
  development

o Exposes the impact of individual function, library or operating system
  calls on your program's performance

o Provides every developer the power to dramatically improve application
  performance

Quantify is an easy to use powerful product that identifies the portions
of an application that slow down execution speed. By displaying performance
errors in both graphical and text formats, Quantify enables developers to
quickly analyze run-time execution and eliminate the guesswork involved
in optimizing an application's performance.

-Developers at every level of experience can build-in optimal performance
-Dramatically reduces time spent discovering the sources of bottlenecks
-Improves end user satisfaction by eliminating irritating performance
 problems
-Gives your software a competitive edge

Quantify supports:

 -Sun SPARC Workstations running SunOS4.
 -Solaris support will be available end feb.1995.
 -HP9000 Series 700 workstations running HP-UX 8.07 or higher
 -HP9000 Series 800 workstations running HP-UX 9.0 and above

                        --------------------------
                             *** PureLink ***
                        --------------------------

Winner of Unix Review's Outstanding Product of the Year 1993!

Software development organizations lose valuable time while waiting for
builds to complete during development cycle. These companies are constantly
searching for new ways to reduce their build times. Modern compilers and 
tools like "make" have provided some gains, but one reason that build
times remain excessive is because an application must be entirely relinked
each and every time.

PureLink from Pure Software provides an immediate solution. PureLink is an
incremental linker which dramatically reduces build times by reusing
information from prior builds to relink only outdated portions of an 
executable.

- Fast build times and rapid development turnaround
- Reduction in build times help developers meet aggressive delivery 
  schedules
- Reduced network traffic
- Requires no changes to current build methodology
- Does not require any additional tools or products to run
- Fast correction of build-time errors
- Pays for itself in 18 weeks

PureLink supports:

  - Sun SPARC Workstations running SunOS4
  - Solaris 2: end feb.1995
                          ----------------------------
                              *** PureCoverage ***
                          ----------------------------

Pure Software's code coverage improvement software.

o Increases software quality by preventing untested code from reaching
  the customer.

o Identifies untested application code quickly and easily

o Code coverage improvement designed by testers for Developers

PureCoverage is the first code coverage improvement software designed
specifically to be used by developers. Pure Software's innovative
and patented technology, Object Code Instertion (OCI) gives PureCoverage
power beyond that found in traditional code coverage tools. PureCoverage
overcomes the barriers to effective use of code coverage by supporting
both C/C++ development environments, being easily deployed and presenting
criticial coverage data in an easy to understand format.

**AN INTEGRATED SOLUTION**

PureCoverage is completely integrated with Purify, Pure Software's
run-time error prevention software. Developers can gather code coverage
data at the same time they are identifying and eliminating errors in the
application. The combination of PureCoverage and Purify is an unbeatable
combination for quality oriented development organizations.

PureCoverage supports:
 - Sun SPARC workstations running SunOS4 
 - Sun SPARC Workstations running Solaris 2.X
 - HP9000 Series 700 workstations running HP-UX 8.07 or higher
 - HP9000 Series 800 workstations running HP-UX 9.0 and above
