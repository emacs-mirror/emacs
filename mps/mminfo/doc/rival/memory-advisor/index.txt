.overview: Memory Advisor (Platinum Herndon Labs) is another memory error 
detection tool.  It uses technology which Pure Software claims infringes their 
patents, and litigation is currently under way in the US courts.  It provides 
memory leak and corruption detection, as well as some tools for code coverage 
and testing.  "Memory Advisor is a run-time analysis tool that detects memory 
errors, such as reading uninitialized memory."  It claims to have a "graphical 
user interface", but in fact it is just text-in-a-window.  Memory Advisor is 
available on HP/UX, Sun SPARC, Solaris 2.x, SunOS 4, Data General AViiON (DG/UX 
5.4), Data General Intel (DG/UX R4.11), DEC Alpha (DEC UNIX), IBM RS6000 (AIX), 
Solaris/x86, SGI IRIX.
