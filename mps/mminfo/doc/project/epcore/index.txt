PROJECT

.overview: ScriptWorks did not have a garbage collector for PostScript objects, 
and had various other shortcomings in memory management.  It was felt that the 
memory management group could provide a new memory manager to make up these 
shortcomings.  The MM group would benefit from increasing client diversity.

.prop: The project was proposed by Yoryos Yeracaris in about March 1995.  
(Unfortunately we have no record of the exact date of this proposal in the 
information system.  The oldest reference Nick Barnes can find is 
mail.richard.1995-03-29.14-43.)

.goal: The project goals, produced in MM/EP meetings, are in goal.epcore.

.req: The project requirements, produced from joint MM/EP technical meetings, 
are in req.epcore.

.design: The project design, produced by analysis of the requirements, is in 
design.epcore .

.plan: There's no separate project plan anymore.  Major tasks are planned as 
part of the group's general planning (see @@@@), and actual changes are managed 
using MM Product Evolution (see product.epcore ).

.guide: The developer's guide is in guide.dev.epcore.
