HISTORY

The Memory Management Group had planned for an external product since its 
creation in 1994.  However, these plans were shelved in order to work on memory 
management for the Dylan project, at the direction of Jerri Pries, then SP 
divisional manager.  The product designs were incorporated into the Dylan 
memory manager design, so that the software would be adaptable to meet product 
requirements.  The result was the MPS.

Work on the product began in earnest in early 1996, after a request from Jo 
Marks to have a product available before the end of the fiscal year (Q1 1997).  
Analysis and design ideas culminated in the document analysis.product, and the 
formation of the MM Quartet, which approved the document in 1996-07 
(meeting.product.1996-07-17).
