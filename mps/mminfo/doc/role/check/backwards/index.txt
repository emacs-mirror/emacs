.def: The backwards checking role involves scanning the product document in 
reverse order.  

.granularity: The checker should use his initiative in determining the 
granularity of this reversal; for example: in an implementation, the checker 
might read each function or type definition in turn from the end of the file; 
for other documents, the checker might read each subsection or paragraph from 
the end backwards.

.log: For the convenience of other checkers and the editor, the backwards 
checker is recommended to log his issues in forwards document order.  See 
proc.review.log.order.
