INTRODUCTION

.scope: This document is a place to store documentation of the bugs found in 
LCLint, their reproductions, and workarounds.

.purpose: The main purpose of this document is to allow us to track why we make 
particular workarounds, and remove them as the bugs are fixed.

.readership: This document should be readable by and C programmer.


ERRORS

.static: LCLint fails when a pointer to a static variable is stored in an 
external variable.  This causes problems with SRCID.  The workaround is to make 
the static external as well.  For example,
  static int i;
  int *p = &i;

  tmp.c:2,13: *** Internal Bug: Transfer type: Initialized
  *** Last code point: aliasChecks.c:3131
  *** Previous code point: aliasChecks.c:3100
       *** Please report bug to lclint-bug@larch.lcs.mit.edu ***
         (attempting to continue, results may be incorrect)
  tmp.c:2,10: Storage i reachable from return value is unqualified static 
(should
                 be unqualified)
    Storage derivable from a parameter does not match the alias kind expected 
for
    the formal parameter. (-compmempass will suppress message)
