For this plan, I have invented projects and divided the work by it, since that 
seems to both how people work, and how they are able to estimate effort.  
Estimated effort remaining in man-days is indicated [thus].  Only Dylan and 
EP-Core are covered here.

DRJ:
  [4] AWL and LO Pools:
    change.dylan.honeybee.170463: Infinite loop in AWL (and perhaps LO?) when 
collecting
    change.dylan.honeybee.170467: Weak values in vectors in Tony's "weak-test" 
stop dying after a while
    change.dylan.honeybee.170462: Assertion failure in AWL pool: p == 
BufferScanLimit(buffer)
    change.dylan.honeybee.170082: Dylan Memory Manager does not meet 
req.dylan(5).prot.ffi.access
    change.dylan.honeybee.170428: PoolAWL violates object format protocol 
during reclaim
    change.dylan.honeybee.170427: PoolAWL makes incorrect assumption about 
destination of assoc field in weak tables
  Other:
    [2] change.dylan.honeybee.170082: Dylan Memory Manager does not meet 
req.dylan(5).prot.ffi.access
    [?] change.dylan.honeybee.170079: Do not meet req.dylan(5).prot.debug
  Approvals: 
    [0.5] change.dylan.honeybee.170459: Assertion on line 0x28e of $HopeName:

    [?] change.dylan.honeybee.170079: Do not meet req.dylan(5).prot.debug
  [?] Definition:
    request.dylan.170452: AWL may cause out-of-language error if the weak 
vector is scanned and the assoc pointer gets fixed to zero
