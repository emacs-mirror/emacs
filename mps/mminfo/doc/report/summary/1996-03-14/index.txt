Subject: Memory Management Group plans for 1996


As we discussed yesterday, here is a summary of medium-term plans.  I hope
it is sufficiently wordy for you!


MEMORY MANAGEMENT GROUP PLANS

Here is an overview of the Memory Management Project schedule for the rest
of 1996.  An explanation of each point follows.

DYLAN
 (releases relating to the support of the Dylan compiler and environment)

We have just released a version of the MPS (Memory Pool System) with an
incremental garbage collector to the Dylan group.  We intend to have met
all the main functional requirements of Dylan by the "Strategic" release
early this summer.  After that we will be filling in gaps and improving
performance on our way to full Dylan release.  As part of this work we
intend to produce performance analysis tools which it may be possible to
release as part of the DylanWorks development environment.


EPCORE
 (releases of EP Core RIP replacement components)

We have recently finished restructuring the existing Core RIP memory
manager (the "Layered" release).  These changes enable us to replace the
memory manager with an MPS-based memory manager without disruption to the
main development and release stream of ScriptWorks, to evaluate the
performance in parallel, and to finally swap in the new system at minimal
cost.

The next step is to develop memory pools and adapt the MPS to meet Core RIP
requirements.  This will result in the "Evaluation" release, which provides
equivalent functionality but not necessarily performance.  It is not
intended to be released into ScriptWorks.  We expect this work to be
complete by June.

After that, we will develop the memory manager to equal (and probably
better) performance and reliability than the existing system (the
"Equivalent" release).  This can be swapped into the main stream of
ScriptWorks development at minimal cost.

Having laid the groundwork we will then be in a position to develop GC for
PostScript objects using the generic framework provided by the MPS.


MLWORKS
 (work required to support MLWorks GC)

We intend to continue to support the MLWorks GC.  We anticipate that there
will be work involving improvement of strategy and porting to new
platforms.  We may convert MLWorks to using the MPS (with custom ML memory
pools) if the benefit outweighs the cost.  The MLWorks collector has been
stable for quite some time and we don't intend to disrupt it unless there
is a good reason to.  The exact requirements of the ML group have yet to be
negotiated.


PRODUCT
 (tentative schedule for work on the external product)

With help from our new Product Marketing Manager I hope to reach a
defintion of a product (or range of products) and their content by the
summer.  We will then be in a position to develop these during the second
half of the year, and, depending on the definition, could possibly be in a
position to release at the beginning of 1997.  It is my hope that we will
be able to develop analysis tools in Dylan that can be shared between the
DylanWorks product and an MM product by delivering them as stand-alone
applications.
