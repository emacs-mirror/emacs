.introduction: This document is here to help you if you are trying to find a 
tag such as "test.mps.a54". It describes how to refer to MMQA tests. It doesn't 
tell you how to run MMQA tests -- for that you need to look in the QA Notebook 
.

.new-style: In this, the naming system which I now prefer, a MMQA test is 
specified by its hope name. I don't maintain versions of tests (instead, I 
create new ones), so the compound and unit names will be sufficient. Typically, 
this will be something like: MMQA_test_<test-group>!<test-number>.c. E.g. 
MMQA_test_function!117.c, a regression test for request.dylan.160064.

.old-style: In the old system which I strongly urge you not to use, tests were 
tagged: test.mps.<c><n>, where <c> is a character and <n> a number. To 
translate such test names, undo the following abbreviations:

  test.mps.<c><n> => MMQA_test_<c>'!<n>.c

where:

  f' = function
  a' = argerr
  c' = conerr
  m' = misc

So test.mps.f12 is MMQA_test_function!12.c, etc. I hope this helps.
