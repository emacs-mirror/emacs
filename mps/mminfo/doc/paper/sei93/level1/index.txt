From pages O-13 - O-14 of paper.sei93:

At the Initial Level, the organization typically does not provide a stable 
environment for developing and maintaining software. When an organization lacks 
sound management practices, the benefits of good software engineering practices 
are undermined by ineffective planning and reaction-driven commitment systems.  

During a crisis, projects typically abandon planned procedures and revert to 
coding and testing. Success depends entirely on having an exceptional manager 
and a seasoned and effective software team. Occasionally, capable and forceful 
software managers can withstand the pressures to take shortcuts in the software 
process; but when they leave the project, their stabilizing influence leaves 
with them. Even a strong engineering process cannot overcome the instability 
created by the absence of sound management practices.  

The software process capability of Level 1 organizations is unpredictable 
because the software process is constantly changed or modified as the work 
progresses (i.e., the process is ad hoc). Schedules, budgets, functionality, 
and product quality are generally unpredictable. Performance depends on the 
capabilities of individuals and varies with their innate skills, knowledge, and 
motivations. There are few stable software processes in evidence, and 
performance can be predicted only by individual rather than organizational 
capability.
