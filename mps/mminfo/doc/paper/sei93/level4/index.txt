From pages O-16 - O-17 of paper.sei93:

At the Managed Level, the organization sets quantitative quality goals for both 
software products and processes. Productivity and quality are measured for 
important software process activities across all projects as part of an 
organizational measurement program. An organization-wide software process 
database is used to collect and analyze the data available from the projects' 
defined software processes. Software processes are instrumented with 
well-defined and consistent measurements at Level 4.  These measurements 
establish the quantitative foundation for evaluating the projects' software 
processes and products.

Projects achieve control over their products and processes by narrowing the 
variation in their process performance to fall within acceptable quantitative 
boundaries. Meaningful variations in process performance can be distinguished 
from random variation (noise), particularly within established product lines. 
The risks involved in moving up the learning curve of a new application domain 
are known and carefully managed.

The software process capability of Level 4 organizations can be summarized as 
predictable because the process is measured and operates within measurable 
limits. This level of process capability allows an organization to predict 
trends in process and product quality within the quantitative bounds of these 
limits. When these limits are exceeded, action is taken to correct the 
situation. Software products are of predictably high quality.
