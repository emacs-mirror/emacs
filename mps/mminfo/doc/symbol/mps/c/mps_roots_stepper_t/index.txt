NAME

mps_roots_stepper_t


SUMMARY

Type of the client-supplied root walker component.


ASSOCIATED PROTOCOLS

None.


TYPE

typedef void (*mps_roots_stepper_t)(mps_addr_t *, mps_root_t, void *, size_t)


ARGUMENTS

The function pointed to by an object of type mps_roots_stepper_t takes the 
following argument list:
(mps_addr_t *ref, mps_root_t root, void *p, size_t s)

ref is the address of a root which references an object in the arena. It's a 
pointer to a root which points to "something" in the client heap. That 
"something" will be an object if the root is an exact root. But it might be an 
interior pointer to an object if the root is an ambiguous root. 

root is the MPS root object which contains ref.

p and s are two closure values which are copies of the corresponding values 
which the client passed into mps_arena_roots_walk.


RETURNED VALUES

he function pointed to by an object of type mps_roots_stepper_t returns no 
values.


RESOURCES

mps.h


DESCRIPTION

A pointer to a function is passed into the function mps_arena_roots_walk; the 
pointer has this type.  The root walker arranges to apply this function to all 
objects which are directly referenced from the roots.


EXAMPLE

ERROR HANDLING
