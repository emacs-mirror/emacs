INTRODUCTION

.intro: A work in progress to summarize the Alpha cache.

Cache Blocks can be evicted (it's just a hint really) with the ECB instruction 
which takes a single byte address.

Prefetch and prefetch-in-order-to-modify hints can be expressed with FETCH and 
FETCH_M.  They operate on 512 byte blocks.  These do nothing on implementations 
up to 21264.

Write hints (this memory will be written to before being read) can be made with 
the WH64 instruction.  This instruction operates on 64 byte blocks.
