INTRODUCTION

.intro: This document is an analysis of the design of the dylan release naming 
schemes.  The actual design is documented in design.dylan.release.naming.  This 
document is used to record meta-information, discussion, alternatives and 
analysis.

POST-KANSAS

After Kansas, we might be considered to be following the yellow-brick road, and 
use names like:
  olive
  gold
  goldenrod
  peru
  orange
  tan
(derived from elements in rgb.txt where red and green exceed blue by a factor 
of two, and red and green are within a factor of two)

richardk 1998-03-24 suggests this alternative:

.impl.design: See design.version.name.word(0)

.impl.fruit:  Proposed names for MM-Dylan versions.  The theme is "Names of 
fruits".  I'm afraid it doesn't meet .req.theme.link (Nice).

.impl.fruit.used: When a word is chosen to be used as a name, mark it with "*".

.impl.fruit.next: The next suggested name is tentatively marked with "x".
To quote design.version.name.word.design:
     2) To select the next name, skip two or three places down 
        the series from the last-selected name.
        (eg. after "Ape" select "Chimp", passing-over "Baboon").

.impl.fruit.deprecate:  Some names are 'not as good' as others; they are
marked with "-" to deprecate them.  In some way, they do not meet 
requirements well.  Usually this is because the word is obscure, often used 
in other contexts, or may be mis-heard as some more common word, or is 
similar to another word in the series.  Reasons for deprecation are given 
in the series below.

.impl.fruit.series:
