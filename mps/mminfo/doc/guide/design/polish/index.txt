.purpose: This guide is for polishing design documents, and should be used 
before review entry (see proc.review.entry) to eliminate common major defects 
(see guide.review.class.major), and during the entry's brief check.  [ It is a 
little MPS-specific. ]


CHECKS

.source: Are all appropriate sources referenced?

.req: Are all requirements specified or referenced?

.req.good: Are all requirements well-founded, as opposed to backwards-derived 
from the design?

.sol.alt: Are possible alternative solutions outlined?

.sol.just: Is the chosen solution justified?

.sol.req: Does the chosen solution meet all requirements?

.def: Is any special terminology defined or referenced?

.error: Does the design specify error cases and abnormal behaviour?

.test: Does the design include test specifications?

.shield: How does the design interact with shields? [MPS]

.thread: How does the design interact with threads?

.platform: How does the design deal with cross-platform issues?

.attr: Have attribute requirements and performance issues been considered in 
the design?

.issue: Does the design document or reference all relevant outstanding issues?

.use: Does the design document or reference a description of how its 
implementation might be used?

.open: Does the design have and describe an appropriate degree of extensibility?

.prot: Are all protocol restriction documented?

.check: Is the interface, etc. checking covered in the design?

.spell: Does it spell check okay?
