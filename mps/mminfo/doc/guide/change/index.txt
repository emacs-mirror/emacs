INTRODUCTION

.scope: This document describes conventions for fields in change documents.  

.readership: This document is intended for any user of MM Evolution.

.update: See proc.darwin.update.

.source: See also the Darwin documentation.


CONVENTIONS

.contact: The contacts are usually inherited from the request and follow the 
rules in guide.request.contact.  There may be additional members if people are 
only interested in a particular change, as opposed to the request.

.files-changed: The "Files changed" field should specify a list of files 
changed, each indicating the old and new version numbers with Hope 
compound/unit names if appropriate; for example:
  MMsrc!poolawl.c(MM_dylan_sunflower.4) MMsrc!poolawl.c(MM_dylan_sunflower.5)
This gives an obvious way to generate a diff from Hope.

[ Same applies to other fields, mutatis mutandis.]

.desc: Change Description: This field should contain a brief description of the 
changes made, and an estimate of the actual effort expended.
