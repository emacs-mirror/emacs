CONVENTIONS

.desc: The description field should have (at least) the following sections:

.desc.release-notes: RELEASE NOTES -- A collection of the release notes that 
apply to this release with resepct to its immediate parent in the DARWIN tree.  
It may contain linked references to other documents (such as symbol 
documentation) rather than inlining them.  Typically, any additions to the 
release notes would appear in their own sub-section.

.desc.release-notes.use: The intended use of the release notes in a release 
document is that, when assembling the release notes to ship with a particular 
release to a particular recipient, the release notes for the relevant set of 
releases (e.g. all those since the last release shipped to that recipient) 
should be intelligently concatenated, expanding inline references as 
appropriate.  In particular, the process of compositing the release notes 
actually shipped should not involve the composition of new text (other than the 
introduction), but rather the copying of text from the release notes sections 
of relevant releases, and referred to documents.

.desc.release-history: RELEASE HISTORY -- A list of events when the release has 
been shipped to a particular recipient on a particualr date.  Where 
appropriate, the release notes actually sent to the recipient should be 
indicated, e.g. by quoting the tag of the relevant mail message.  It should be 
possible to deduce from this section when the release was shipped and to whom, 
and exactly what was said in the shipped release notes.
