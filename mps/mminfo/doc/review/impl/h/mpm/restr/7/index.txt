    _ring -> ring (unnecessary precaution).
    Where does lib_FILE come from?
    TRACE_SCAN_BEGIN etc.  Were does documentation belong?
      (Answer: Make a fake definition with the implementation.)
    TRACE_FIX1 could use RefSetZone rather than writing it out (maybe).
    Could change (Word)Addr to AddrWord(addr) to make sure dependency on
      bit pattern is explicit and controlled.
  drj
    No leader comment.
    Could have RingInsert.
    Could have AVER_EXP for use in expressions (esp. RING_FOR).
    PoolGetClass is acanonical.  Document, or change to PoolPoolClass.
    POOLFIX can be renamed to PoolFix.
    TraceSet stuff should have backup functions.
    Shouldn't Zones be provided by the arena?  Should be separate from RefSet
      anyway.
  richard
    AVER etc. should be explained.  Why aren't they in assert.h, e.g.?
    TRACE_SCAN_BEGIN etc. should be linked to the mps.h versions.

Edit (richard)

1. Changed _ring to ring.
2. lib_FILE comes from lib.h, of course.
3. Added AddrWord and SizeWord macros and made use of them.
4. Removed PoolGetClass (used in one place, everywhere else is pool->class).
5. Changed POOLFIX to PoolFix as per new convention.
6. Added link from TRACE_SCAN_BEGIN to mps.h.
