INTRODUCTION

.intro: Richard Brooksby, Alex Parnes, Mark Preece, and Clive Harris met to 
discuss Memory Management products.


PRODUCT FEEDBACK

Alex: Haven't seen Jo, George, anybody.  Quiet week in that respect.  Jo is 
here (1CC) this week.


QA

Bring in Richard Tucker and David Hedley.  David Hedley is a candidate for MM 
or ML QA.  Also a new possibility: Keneth White, though probably not in SP QA.


PRODUCT MANAGEMENT

Alex: Outstanding candidate for SP product management, but he took a job 
elsewhere just before we offerred him a job.  He went to Oracle.


COMPETETIVE PRODUCTS

Clive: I'm just going through the cycle of getting a PO.  4-6 weeks before it 
arrives.


JAVA

No progress.  Could be six or seven figures.  There's also the prestige.  Get 
Jo's attention when he's on the West Coast.


DYLAN DELIVERY DATES

A = October/B = December/C = March.


NEXT MEETING

28th 10/3.

Gerber 110Mb job.
