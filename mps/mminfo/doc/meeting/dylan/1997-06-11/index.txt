INTRODUCTION

.intro: Richard Brooksby <richard> met Tony Mann <tony> to discuss removing the 
dependency of the Dylan Memory Manager on the C library.


NOTES

.control: Tony would like to be able to control the dependency of the MM on the 
C library.

.free-standing: Richard agreed to ship a free-standing MM and the source code 
for the ANSI plinth (impl.c.mpsliban and impl.c.mpsioan) so that he can link or 
replace them as he sees fit.

.change: Tony is aware that the plinth interface is likely to be redesigned.

.assert: Richard also suggested that he install an assertion handler.  
.assert.doc: Documentation for the assertion handler installation protocol will 
be shipped.

.lo: The LO ("leaf only") pool will be shipped with the next release.  It might 
be only "experimental".  .lo.doc: David Jones <drj> will provide some notes on 
how to use it before the release.
