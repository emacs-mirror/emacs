INTRODUCTION

.intro: Dave Berry <DaveB>, Tony Mann <Tony>, David Jones <DRJ>, and Gavin 
Matthews <GavinM> met to discuss scheduled for forthcoming MM/Dylan releases.


BOX-TURTLE RELEASE

.box-turtle.prev: Previously, version.dylan.box-turtle had been scheduled for 
1998-02-20, and was to include:
  - Weak pointers dies more promptly (request.dylan.170467);
  - Interface to low-memory handling reserve (rainy day fund) 
(request.dylan.170087);
  - Interface to inform/control GC (request.dylan.170423);
  - Various small things.

.box-turtle.need: In fact, these things wouldn't be useful with Dylan work to 
use them, and performance (particularly multi-pool collections) would be far 
more useful.

.box-turtle.perf: David Jones said that a performance improvement of 2% was 
certain.  5% would be good.  One week is tight.

.box-turtle.sched: Dave Berry decided that version.dylan.box-turtle should be 
aimed at giving performance improvements, and could be release on 1998-03-06, 
providing there were no consequent Dylan changes.

.box-turtle.control: Some interface to controlling/informing GC could 
optionally be included, possibly in stub form.

.box-turtle.clash: It was noted that the week before release would clash with 
the unapproved trips to Cambridge of Tucker and the Adaptive Systems Group.

.box-turtle.confirm: Dave said that these decisions weren't definite until 
after the Dylan Compiler Meeting on 1998-02-17 Tuesday.


SALAMANDER RELEASE

.salamander: There was a brief discussion of the following release.  
version.dylan.salamander should probably contain the things droppped from 
version.dylan.box-turtle and should be around 1998-04-24.  Some MM/Dylan 
discussion should take place about interface changes.


EFFORT

.effort: This meeting was attended by four people.  It lasted 24 minutes.  
Writing up took 20 minutes.  Total effort: 2 man-hours
