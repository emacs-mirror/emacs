INTRODUCTION

.intro: Richard Brooksby <richard> and Nick Barnes <nickb> met Jonathan 
Bacharach <jonathan> to discuss ways in which MM could help with reducing Dylan 
image sizes in the short term.


NOTES


The Problem

.prob: Jonathan describes the problem that, after recompilation of a module, 
the old compiled result remains on the heap and doesn't get collected away.  
(See .fig.prob.)  .xref: There is a lot of internal cross-referencing in the 
compiled result, so a reference to one part of it tends to keep the whole thing 
alive.

Suggestions

.explorer: Nick developed something called the "explorer" for MLWorks which 
allows one to walk around the heap and identify references to things, large 
objects, etc.  Something like this could be implemented for Dylan.  It wouldn't 
be a long term solution, just a short term hack to help with the immediate 
problem.

.xref-reduction: It would be good for Dylan to reduce the amount of 
cross-linking in the compiled results, and to use weak references wherever 
possible to allow the GC to remove parts of the result.


ACTION

.act.think: Richard and Nick will think about what could be done and propose 
something.
