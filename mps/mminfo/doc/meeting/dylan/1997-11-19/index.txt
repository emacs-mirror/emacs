.intro: GavinM met briefly with Tony to discuss various requirements related to 
the 1Gb address-space restriction.

.priority: Tony has consulted with the compilers group and the consensus is 
that req.dylan(5).dc.env.self is "nice" for version.dylan.cottonwood in 
relation to performance work.  It will return to "essential" for 
version.dylan.meadow-lark.
Related requirements such as req.dylan(5).attr.capacity and 
req.dylan(5).attr.obj.max will remain nice for version.dylan.cottonwood, and 
are likely to be met by the same work.
