INTRODUCTION

David Jones, Tucker Withington, and Richard Brooksby met with Rod Burstall,
John Longley, and Healf Goguen in order to develop our mutual memory
management
model.


AGENDA

1. Introductions
2. Explaining the history of the collaboration to Healf and Tucker
3. Discussion of graph types
4. John and Rod's ML coding exercise


SUMMARY

A very useful meeting which I totally failed to take many notes about.
This meeting stimulated the idea of an ML model of the MM system and the
use of ML as a tool for detailed design and specification within the
project.  This is already proving useful.

Here are the notes I did take, FWIW:

- MM/LFCS meeting
 - Introductions
 - Tell Healf and Tucker about the system
  - Dynamic threatening boundary
  - Are labels the right way?  Need some spec. of semantic correctness.
  - Container formats are like graph types, scan in particular.
  - Naked graphs without labels etc. might be useful.
 - Graph types and consequences: lack of canonicalness
 - John and Rod's coding exercise
  - Implementation of the model of the system in ML?
 - GC(t)
 - Apply the system to a simple algorithm
 - Apply it to a more realistic algorithm
 - Next meetings
  - Monday 17th July at LFCS, Edinburgh
  - Monday 21st August at Harlequin, Cambridge (including Healf)
