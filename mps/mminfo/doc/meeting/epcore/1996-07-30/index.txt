INTRODUCTION

.scope: Nick Barnes and Andy Cave met informally to discuss the requirements 
for management of general memory.

.ref: The meeting was held in order to clear up confusion expressed by Andy in 
mail.andy.1996-07-29.18-16.


NOTES

.class.old: Nick outlined the classification of memory in the current 
requirements (req.epcore(8)): DL, PS, cache, trapping, "temporary".

.pool.old: Nick explained that the "cache" and "trapping" classes could be 
provided from the same pool as "temporary" memory (mm_pool_temp, nee 
TRMEMBANK1), although the MM may later take advantage of additional properties 
of the other classes.

.general: Andy expanded on his mail (mail.andy.1996-07-29.18-16): that this 
pool is really "general" memory rather than "temporary".

.class.new: A new, wider classification of memory was agreed: DL, PS, cache, 
trapping, temporary, static, general.

.class.temp: "temporary" memory will be genuinely transient. .class.temp.limit: 
The 1Mb limit (req.epcore.attr(8).tmp.pool.max) applies here.

.class.static: "static" memory will not be freed. .class.static.limit: There's 
up to about 16Mb of static memory (because basemap1, which can be that large, 
is allocated here).

.class.general: "general" memory will be everything else.

.pool.new: "cache", "trapping", "temporary" and "static" memory classes can all 
be provided from the "general" pool for the time being, although later the MM 
may take advantage of additional properties of these classes.


ACTIONS

.act.req: Nick will update the EP requirements and notify people by mail.
