Bob has just finished another batch of GLUE work, and this should all be coming 
to an end in the next week or so. 

Bob has written up some notes on my presentation in meeting.general.<something> 
and is just getting in to the architecture section of the talk.

Bob's commitments:
- GLUE
- MM project
- Dylan project
- ML product, maybe
- Dylan Book

Plans:
- Half time for the next few weeks.
- Busy at end of November on the Dylan Book. - After that depends on Dylan 
documentation plan -- need to talk to AndyS. 

What should we produce out of these notes? Probably a generally accessible 
overview of the project in general, and another of the Dylan-specific 
application. The purpose of the document is to provide a reference point for 
the project staff and an introductory document for others. 

Bob predicts another two weeks to produce this document in a useful form. It 
need not be a polished item.

After that we will work on a detailed design document for some part of the 
system in order to determine form and procedure of such things. This will 
occupy the time up to the Dylan Book work. 

Work from December onwards depends in part on the Dylan documentation plan, so 
we'll see.

I suggested Bob develop a glossary as he goes along. We can work out the exact 
form later, but maybe one document per definition with crosslinks etc. I 
invited Bob to mail me with glossary questions, as I can answer these on the 
bus or in odd moments.
