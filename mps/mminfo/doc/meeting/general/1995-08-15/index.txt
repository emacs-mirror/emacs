Agenda:  What meters shall we put in the "debugging" release and how, bearing 
in mind that the next push of work is the incremental release.

Measurements to make:
- Interface points are obvious
- Proportion of time spent in MM
- Distribution of object types/sizes/wrappers
- Distribution of lifetimes
- Ambiguous fixes / nailed down cards
- Number of exact fixes
- Size of atomic scan portion
- Current "pause" times

For later:
- Distribution of lifetime by object category
- Look for timing card with clock.

How:
- Interface points - obvious
- Distribution of object types, etc.
 - Allocated: measure on commit
 - Forwarded: measure on move
- Fixes: count them
- Condemned cards vs. nailed cards (proportion)
- Size of various scan portions: by root, by what is scanned
- GetCurrentTime for millisecond clock on some events

Target varieties:
- Meter everything
- Just timing, for accuracy
- Static meter annotation controls required later.
