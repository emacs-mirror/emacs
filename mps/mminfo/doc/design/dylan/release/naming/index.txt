INTRODUCTION

.intro: This describes the design for the naming scheme for dylan versions.

.def.version: A version is a string of releases with a common source ancestry.  
But see elsewhere for the real definition (DARWIN?).

.overview: These names are only intended for the internal names of releases.  
Externally (ie for dylan) we use a numeric scheme which is not described.

.scheme.impure: The original naming scheme was impure and based on the intended 
functionality of the version.  The names used were:
alloc
minimal
zoned
debug
incr

.scheme.kansas: The next scheme was based on the state symbols of Kansas 
(Kansas at one point being the name for one of the DylanWorks releases (it 
being the starting point of a journey to the Emerald City).  Here is a copy of 
a web document describing the state symbols of Kansas: .  The names used were:
buffalo
sunflower
honeybee
cottonwood
meadowlark
box-turtle
salamander

.scheme.bird: After some analysis of the requirements of naming schemes, this 
design now follows MM's general principles for naming versions 
(design.version.name.word(0)).  Now the versions are named after birds likely 
to be found in a field and scared (or something like that):  The initial bird 
list can be found in mail.gavinm.1998-04-15.10-11(0).

Bird names used so far:

blackbird
crow
dove
jackdaw

Future candidates.  Names in brackets indicate standby names for possible 
insertion later.  They should not ordinarily be used.
