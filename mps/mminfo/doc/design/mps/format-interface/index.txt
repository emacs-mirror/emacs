[This document should describe the format interface and protocols, the 
contraints on how they may be used, etc. -- richard 1996-04-17]

These methods are provided by clients in order to describe to

are part of the Format object (see impl.h.mpmst.format).

There are some more notes about format methods in meeting.qa.1996-10-16.
