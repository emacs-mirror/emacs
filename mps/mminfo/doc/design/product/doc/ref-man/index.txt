Notes:

Each method should document the codes it could return and say what they mean.  
A bit like UNIX man pages for system calls (see mmap for an example). (from 
meeting.doc.1997-05-28.res.code.meaning)

The reference entry for mps_pool_create should describe mps_pool_create_opt_s, 
etc. (from meeting.doc.1997-05-28.optarg.eg)

Maybe we should say what has to be done before a destroy in the reference 
manual entry.  For example, all allocation points belonging to a pool must be 
destroyed before that pool is destroyed.  (from 
meeting.doc.1997-05-28.adt.finish)
