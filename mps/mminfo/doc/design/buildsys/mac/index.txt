INTRODUCTION

.intro: This documents the design of the MPS build system on Macintosh systems 
upto MacOS 9.

.readership: For any MM developer.


OVERVIEW

.overview.multiple: In fact there are multiple systems.  Currently (1998-12-04) 
it is possible to use either Metrowerks Codewarrior (builder.mw(1)) or the 
Scriptworks DEV environment (builder.ac(0)).  Only ptw and richard ever used 
Metrowerks Codewarrior and building with it is not a requirement, so support 
for this in future is likely to wane (rapidly).  It is not documented here.

.environment: The Scriptworks DEV MPW environment is used (known as "DEV").  
DEV is available in SW_macdev.  Installation instructions are available in 
SW_macdev!DEV.install.readme(trunk).  It is a configured version of the Apple 
development environment MPW <URL: 
http://developer.apple.com/dev/tools/mpw-tools/index.html>.

.documentation: Key documents are <<_Introduction to MPW_, Second Edition, 
Developer Press, Apple Computer Inc., 1995>>, <<_Building and Managing Programs 
in MPW_, Second Edition, For MPW version 3.4, Developer Press, Apple Computer 
Inc., 1996>> and <<_MPW Command Reference_, For MPW version 3.4, December 
1996>>.  These are available in PDF on Apple Developer CDs (and presumably on 
the old ETO CDs) and the Apple ftp site: <URL: 
ftp://ftp.apple.com/developer/Tool_Chest/Core_Mac_OS_Tools/MPW_etc./> (and on 
paper for $s).
