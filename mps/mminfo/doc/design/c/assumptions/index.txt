.purpose: This document documents the assumptions we make about implementations 
of the C language.  It exists to provide tags to quote when these assumptions 
are used, and when they are tested.  We do not attempt to list where they are 
assumed ot tested here.  We should not make such assumptions without quoting a 
tag from this document.


ASSUMPTIONS

.array.pointer: We assume that we can create pointers beyond the end of arrays, 
up to twice the array length beyond the start.  This assumption is deprecated; 
do not use it in new code.

.link-name: We assume that external identifiers are significant to arbitrary 
length, case-sensitive.

.pointer.word: We assume that a void * pointer can be stored in a Word (see 
design.mps.type.word) without loss of accuracy.

.unsigned-long.word: We assume that an unsigned long can be stored in a Word 
(see design.mps.type.word) without loss of accuracy. [is this an assumption or 
just the definition of Word? -- 1997-06-24 drj]

.dollar.source: We assume (throughout the code) that the character $ is 
available in the source character set (see ISO C subclause 5.2.1).  This 
character is used for $HopeName$ expansion (see Keyword Expansion in the 
Checkout document of the Hope Reference Manual ) in strings and comments.

.dollar.execution: We assume (throughout the code) that the character $ is 
avilable in the execution character set (see ISO C subclause 5.2.1).  This 
character is used for $HopeName$ expansion (see Keyword Expansion in the 
Checkout document of the Hope Reference Manual ) in strings and comments.
