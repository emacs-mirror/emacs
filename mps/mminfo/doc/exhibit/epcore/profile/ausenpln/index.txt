I took profiles of the two runs of AUSENPLN.PS within this run. Here they are:
.start: Profile of ausenpln run at start of suite:
.last: Profile of ausenpln at end of suite:

.investigation: Viewing these with CAPVIEW shows that much more time was spent 
in MM in the second, and that this was due to a great increase in the number of 
objects allocated (and freed) in the temp (MVFF) pool.

.log.profiling: Here's the SW logfile from that run. N.B. times are not a guide 
to SW performance, as the profiler was slowing things down a lot: 

.log.not-profiling: Here's a SW logfile from a similar run (slightly different 
order of jobs) in which profiling wasn't used:
