.setup: The attached profiles were produced using:
- SWprod_pc!(.) of 1998-09-10 01:00:00 BST
- release.epcore.minnow.1, variety.wi and release.epcore.anchovy.1, variety.we,
- NT's CAP profiler
- on resource.terpsichore.

.profiling-changes: Profiling with CAP requires recompilation and linking, thus 
the mm's used were not identical to those released. To make all function names 
visible in the profile, I found it necessary to change all "static" functions 
to "extern". The mm was compiled without /O2 and with /Gh. ScriptWorks' linker 
settings were also changed, to "-debug:mapped,partial -debugtype:coff", and the 
cap.lib library was linked in.

.settings: SW setting were as follows.
.settings.buffering: single (if)
.settings.memory: RIP had just under 30 MB.
.settings.glue: I changed the MM glue to use the CLIENT ARENA in all these 
tests. The tests with anchovy.1 used MVFF for the temp pool only.


SETUP1
.settings.1.device: testhqn capstan, monochrome halftone
.settings.1.output: A4, CMYK separations, 1270dpi, extra grays (1024), HPS

SETUP2
.settings.2.device: testchqn capstan, composite halftone
.settings.2.output: A4, 400dpi, HFCS, HDS fine, extra grays (512)


PROFILES OF JOBS THAT WERE UNEXPECTEDLY SLOW WITH ANCHOVY

For explanation and time measurements, see mail.rit.1998-09-25.15-29(0).

.profiles.a1p101: With SETUP1, I ripped QATESTS\A1P101.HPG,
with minnow.1 ()
and with anchovy.1 ()


.profiles.hgp101: With SETUP1, I ripped QATESTS\HGP101.HPG,
with minnow.1 ()
and with anchovy.1 ()


.profiles.ausenpln: With SETUP2, I ripped AUSENPLN.PS,
with minnow.1 ()
and with anchovy.1 ()



The profiles may be read as text files, processed with CAPSTATS.EXE or viewed 
graphically with CAPVIEW.EXE. (These tools are in the Intel NT SDK).

All the percentages shown are percentages of total MM time, not of total SW 
time. Of course, the action of profiling itself will introduce errors here, so 
treat everything as suspicious.
