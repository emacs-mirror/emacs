.setup: The attached profiles were produced using:
- ScriptWorks trunk of 1998-08-17 00:00:00 GMT
- release.epcore.minnow.1, variety.wi
- NT's CAP profiler
- on resource.terpsichore.

.profiling-changes: Profiling with CAP requires recompilation and linking, thus 
the mm used was not identical to minnow.1. To make all function names visible 
in the profile, I found it necessary to change all "static" functions to 
"extern". The mm was compiled without /O2 and with /Gh. ScriptWorks' linker 
settings were also changed, to "-debug:mapped,partial -debugtype:coff", and the 
cap.lib library was linked in.


.settings: SW setting were as follows.
.settings.buffering: single (if)
.settings.device: testhqn capstan
.settings.output: A4, CMYK separations, 1270dpi, extra grays (1024), HPS
.settings.memory: RIP had 60000 MB.

.settings.full: For full settings information, see the output from 0000conf.ps: 


To rip all of the QATESTS suite takes sufficiently long that CAP can't cope 
(the time measurements overflow). So I divided the suite into 4 parts, 
alphabetically. Here are profiles (.end) and SW logfiles (.log) for each:

.qatests_0-F.end:   .qatests_0-F.log: 
.qatests_G-N.end:   .qatests_G-N.log: 
.qatests_O-R.end:   .qatests_O-R.end: .qatests_S-Z.end:   .qatests_S-Z.end: 

The profiles may be read as text files, processed with CAPSTATS.EXE or viewed 
graphically with CAPVIEW.EXE. (These tools are in the Intel NT SDK).

All the percentages shown are percentages of total MM time, not of total SW 
time. Of course, the action of profiling itself will introduce errors here, so 
treat everything as suspicious.
