.sheep.09-41-02: hi everyone !!!!

.lmb.09-41-27: hiya, sheep.  i think we're the only ones here.

.sheep.09-42-40: Nick is that you ? I thought you where on holyday ? 

.lmb.09-42-57: he is.  i'm borrowing his mac for today.

.sheep.09-43-24: So who are you

.sheep.09-43-28: ?

.lmb.09-44-30: i'm the documentor.

.lmb.09-44-41: at least, when i'm not being yanked off MM to do other stuff.

.lmb.09-44-59: ACTION sighs

.lmb.09-45-19: are you coming to the house today to meet me?

.sheep.09-45-48: Hi L. Yes I hope to be over this afternoon. Looks like the 
nice day got the better of everyone.

.lmb.09-46-25: drj is at jon thackeray's doing ML.  gavin isn't in yet.  
richards b and t are here, but aren't signed on.

.lmb.09-48-05: the mm group is getting rather large, isn't it?

.lmb.09-48-09: ACTION counts

.lmb.09-48-29: w/management and me, it comes to ten people now.

.lmb.09-48-52: six developers, qa, doc, two managers.

.lmb.09-49-09: ACTION remembers when it was just richard and ptw, with drj 
starting in a week.

.sheep.09-51-47: Well depending on the way you look at it 10 people sounds 
about right

.lmb.09-52-04: we really need 1.5 doc people for six developers.

.sheep.09-52-21: I have seem smaller compaines make Money.

.sheep.09-53-12: This is intreasting- I've not done commerical stuff before is 
there a formula

.lmb.09-53-16: though i suppose a lot of the development doesn't work on the 
external product.

.sheep.09-53-19: that's commonly used to do this ?

.lmb.09-53-33: should be 1 doc person and i think 1 qa person for every 4 
developers.

.sheep.09-54-07: This sounds intreasting. Rember that the MM people do a lot of 
out sourceing

.sheep.09-54-18: Ie they do work for other groups.

.sheep.09-54-48: It's fuzzy about who is on product and who is on internal 
support.

.lmb.09-54-52: right, and so need less doc resources.

.sheep.09-55-22: Nick Barns still does a lot of ML. And Daivd is off to day 
doing the same thing

.sheep.09-56-04: My GirlFriend Ruth is working on a book about Microstation
