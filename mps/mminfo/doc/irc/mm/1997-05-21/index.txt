    GavinM: Hello David.
--> drj  ^GRemember we have a meeting in 18 minutes.
       drj: is that a question or an assertion?
       drj: er, oops.  I replied by talk to a msg.  the disgrace of it.
       drj: it's times like this I wish I had commented my PostScript
    GavinM: It's a command.
    GavinM: PostScript is self-documenting.
       drj: erm.  I'm not sure I understand or appreciate that last assertion
    GavinM: Puns.  Never explain; never apologise.

   Richard: Hi!
     sheep: hello
   Richard: Good eh?
   Richard: Primitive, but it works.
     sheep: hello richard 
     sheep: who's hanging around ?
       drj: I am vaguely here.
       drj: did you manage to grab hold of the log files sheep?
     sheep: I think I must down load the windows client the screen is full of 
junk
     sheep: looks like I found the clear command
     sheep: is anyone there ? 
    GavinM: I'm here.  I have a Mac client.
     sheep: Who is visting I heard them on the phone
       drj: leah
       drj: aka lmb
    GavinM: Leah, our documentor, is passing through.
     sheep: Hi Leah (incase she can see the screen).
     sheep: Gavin are you using HOMER ? 
    GavinM: No.  
   Richard: I'm using ircle.
    GavinM: Me too.
     sheep: Hay I'm programming in Java at the moment using symantec cafe 
cooooooool
     sheep: has any one got a log file I can use ? 
       drj: er, did you read my mail sheep?
     sheep: daivid yes I'm just got it . I'll try grabbing it now
     sheep: I might be doing this wrong but, I'm on the longstanton domain and 
     sheep: I cannt see aaron Am I doing somethign wrong ? 
       drj: er, I'm surprised that you're on the longstanton domain.  I'll ring 
you.
   Richard: I'd like to see Symantec Café sometime.
       drj: except, you're not there. Not only that, but your voice mail 
greeting is actually nick.
            Richard goes to get lunch
     sheep: OK I just stepped out to get some coffe. I'll phone you
     sheep: Thought - Richard can you see my machine with Look@me  ? 
    GavinM: Richard's nhee hall I try?
    GavinM: Richard's not here.  Shall I try?
     sheep: yes what shall we do ? 
       drj: unfortunately on the PC, look@me can only only look at other 
people.  you can't be looked at.
       drj: unless you're using win95.  Breaks NT's security model I guess.
    GavinM: Tell me your name or IP address.
     sheep: ooops hang on phone call
            Richard returns with a sandwich
   Richard: Sheep: If you're running Windows NT I don't think I can look at 
you, no.
       drj: we could get a camera
    GavinM: Um, yes.  I agree.  We can't look at NT.
       drj: there are also technooligies that allow an NT display to be copied 
and driven by an X server.  they might do just the copying bit.
     sheep: __endof phone call_
     sheep: Shame about not being able to look at NT. 
     sheep: If we got a camera where would it be ? 
    GavinM: Timbuktoo Pro can look at NT, but still only one observer.
       drj: on a tripod I think.  sometimes they have groovy brackets that 
attache themselves to desks and monmitors.
     sheep: but would the camera show me/screen or the activity in the pool 
hall ? 
       drj: perhaps we should get 2.  It wasn't a very serious suggestion.  It 
would be cool to have a pair of cameras, but that's about all right now.
       drj: IRC is good.  I feel more in contact with sheep already.  
Previously I'd had to think quite quite hard to remember that you were in the 
group sheep.
     sheep: I think it would be quite cool too :-) 
     sheep: I agreee I do feel more in contact (If everyone keeps typeing).
       drj: Sheep, I have borrowed your book on visual Interface Design. (gavin 
had it previously)
     sheep: groovey on the book front I'd be intreasted to see how a 
mathmagican handles a book on industrial design.!
     sheep: this is great when do we do another remote review with this ? 
       drj: I have read other things on interface design.  Actually, not very 
much.  I have read a book called "The Trouble With Computers" (gavin has my 
copy atm).  It's written by, landauer (or something like that)
       drj: it's really a book on how computers haven't made things more 
productive, but of course it analyses why, and claims that poor interface is a 
lot of the reason
     sheep: I'm slowly bringing up all my interface books from UCL. I have a 
groovy
     sheep: interactive CD-ROM from apple (apple human interface guidelines). 
       drj: oh yeah
       drj: I've heard Good Things about apple's HI guidelines.
     sheep: I found the apple guidelines too be quite good.
       drj: being a human, I'm quite interested in HCI
     sheep: another rumour bites the dust

     sheep: David what IRC client is best for NT ? 
     sheep: hi PT !
   Richard: Good morning Tucker.
       drj: I don't know sheep, I using the exceedingly crufty UNIX client atm.
       drj: 'lo Tucker
       ptw: Perhaps.  It's taken me 35 minutes to get IRC to connect -- phone 
busy mostly.
     sheep: Daivd I found 3 ICR clients I'll try down loading one .
       ptw: Too bad we couldn't find a way to satisfy Hqn security and use my 
local ISP...
     sheep: Tucker I've been working on Dylan but I'm not sure it's OOP.
       drj: When spoken, OOP is a "naughty word" (fine: 50p) in the Pool Hall
       ptw: I suspect you believe OOP^h^h^h*** means methods firmly attached to 
classes.
     sheep: Well Tucker, I'm not sure I understand Dylan 100% and Multimethods 
are groovey
     sheep: how ever I'm not sure the protection afforded by getter and setters 
are enough
    GavinM: See 
<URL:http://www.harlequin.com/mm/reference/glossary/o.html#object-oriented>.
       ptw: Ah, you believe OOP^h^h^h*** means class-level encapsulation
     sheep: I'll have a look
       ptw: Dylan offers encapsulation at the module level
       ptw: How many Mac users knew that you set the default page setup by 
option-OK?
       ptw: And how many knew that if you switch printers using Desktop 
Printers, Notes exits ungracefully (and continues to until you use the 
Chooser).  Bleah.
     sheep: yes I can see why encapuslation at the level of module could fix 
some 
     sheep: of the problems I percive.
    GavinM: I didn't know.  I don't use desktop printers.
   Richard: ptw: Option-OK?  I never knew that.
   Richard: How did you find out/
   Richard: Sheep: Dylan is more OOP than most things.
       drj: Sheep, gotta a copy of Visio that needs shifting?  *wink* *wink*
     sheep: definatly more oop that fortan common blocks ;-)
            Richard is away hacking the collection strategy
       drj: actually, there's a nasty hack you can perform with fortran COMMON 
blocks to implement a kind of polymorphism.
       ptw: option-OK:  MacLuser 101 tips article.  Especially important in the 
US as the default-default is "small" paper, which clips most my docs.
       ptw: Dylan == OOP if you take the "generally accepted" definition
       ptw: vs. the "popular definition" (OOP == C++)
   Richard: ptw: Tsk.  I bet it's not in the Mac OS Guide.
     sheep: I'll send an email about what makes it less oopy. I'ts complex.
     sheep: does anyone know how to get Pkzip anywhere on the net ? 
       drj: unzipnt should be on your pc sheep
   Richard: ptw: No, thought not.
       drj: I have it in c:\hqbin\nt\x86\unzipnt.exe
   Richard: Perhaps I should tape down my "Option" key and see what happens as 
I do things.
     sheep: OK found it ! thanks
       ptw: opt-OK:  Further, if the Page Setup dialog has an app-specific 
panel, then opt-OK only sets the default for the app, otherwise globally... 
   Richard: I have downloaded a demo of PopupFolder.  Very handy, though I 
could live without it.
   Richard: I have also installed MkLinux on my home Mac.  Surprisingly easy, 
compared to installing Linux on a PC, which is utter hell.
   Richard: It took me a week the first time, and still takes most of a day 
even though I know what I'm doing.

 Iconoclas: is anyone there ?
            Richard nods
       drj: y
 Iconoclas: thanks - I've been getting this funky client working.
   Richard: Tucker, we're trying to figure out a formula for predicting 
survival of objects.
   Richard: We just want something roughly right to start with.  We have three 
variables available:
*** Signoff: Iconoclas (EOF From client)
   Richard: 1. the time since birth of the object
*** sheep (sheep@zaarin.cam.harlequin.co.uk) has joined channel #mm
   Richard: 2. the original volume of data (bytes) that the object has survived 
from
   Richard: 3. the time since the object was last observed to be reachable
   Richard: We reckon there's a curve something like (1-e^-a)^t which gives the 
probability of an object being alive.
       drj: 2. is a non-concept as I was arguing (apparently unclearly) 
yesterday
   Richard: Where a is the age and t is the time since it was last reachable.
       drj: is some appropriately scaled units
       ptw: I don't see how "time since last observed reachable" could 
correlate.
   Richard: Well, you can get 2 by dividing the size of the object by the 
probability.
       ptw: 1. is simply the generational hypothesis
   Richard: If you've just collected it the probability that it's reachable is 
1.  (Collected = traced and found it.)
   Richard: Nick observed that without this input you get things repeatedly 
collected even thought you know you've just proved them alive.
   Richard: David suggested a radioactive decay from the point at which you 
last observed te object to be alive, and another decay based on the age.  Thus 
you get a 2d function.
       drj: it's times like this I wish I had concentrated for my Quantum 
Mechanics course.
   Richard: We plotted some neat curves using "Graphing Calculator" yesterday.
   Richard: (This is the function we want to learn, btw, and not just take 
these few inputs.)
   Richard: If you just have 1 (a) then you might keep trying to kill and 
object, convinced that it "ought" to be dead, even though you keep finding it 
reachable.
       ptw: Why would the death probability be affected by a collection 
happening?
   Richard: It isn't.
   Richard: It's just that it's affected bya n object being proved reachable.
       ptw: 1 says the longer an object is around, the less you should try to 
collect it.
   Richard: If it's reachable, it's reachable, independent of when you found 
out.
   Richard: It's just that collection happens to find that out for you (for the 
objects that survive).
   Richard: We could have this all wrong, of course.
       ptw: So, they are the same thing are they not?
       drj: We want to estimate a function for "The probality that an object of 
age <a> is alive, given it was last proved alive <t> ago"
       ptw: Collection slots objects into generations so we can approximate 
their age and from age approximate their life expectancy.
    GavinM: Sheep, is that an NT client you have?
   Richard: If an object is condemned but proved to be alive, that affects your 
estimation of whether it's alive or not, no?
     sheep: yes I have an NT client working 
       drj: this is a more useful number than "The probability that an object 
of age <a> is alive"
    GavinM: Sheep, can I have a copy?  I'd like onehat ldepaas as fA s a type 
them.
   Richard: The one-dimensional function S(a) is just S(a,a) where S(a,t) is 
the two-dimensional function I'm after.
       ptw: I don't buy that.  t is just an interval in a.  This is like saying 
if you get a lot of heads, tails becomes more likely.
   Richard: Of course, we could have an n-dimensional function which has inputs 
like data type, allocation site, etc. but that's for later.
    GavinM: I'd like one that can accept characters as fast as I can type them.
   Richard: But Tucker, don't you agree that the correct esimate of the 
liveness of an object proven live is 1?
       ptw: Don't you want to estimate life-expectancy, not liveness?
   Richard: I don't understand "interval in a".
   Richard: At any one point, Im' trying to decide whether there is net benefit 
in starting a collection on a cohort of objects.  I want to know liveness of 
that cohort.
     sheep: Gavin, yes sure  do you want to down load it direct or get it from 
my machine
   Richard: So then I can do FORWARD_COST * S(a,t) * size + SCAN_COST * 
(grey_set + S(a,t) * size) + COLLECTION_COST to calculate the cost 
(approximately).
   Richard: And I can do (1-S(a,t)) * size * RECLAIM_BENEFIT to calculate the 
benefit.
       ptw: S == probability of surviving a collection.
   Richard: RECLAIM_BENEFIT is the benefit per byte of reclaiming (in time 
units).  In other words, the cost of managing an object.  Neat, huh?
   Richard: Yes, S == that.  Sorry if we weren't being clear.
       ptw: I think your "t" is a statistical fallacy.
   Richard: Could be.  Why so?
       ptw: Similar to observing a string of heads and thinking tails more 
likely.
    GavinM: Sheep, whichever is easier.  Can you share the installer?
       drj: if that's so then we should be able to prove it using real data.
   Richard: Don't you agree that the correct esimate of the liveness of an 
object proven live is 1?
     sheep: Gavin, Yes I havn't done this before it might take a bit of time 
       ptw: Just because I observe an object live at t, does not change the 
probability it will die does it?  It certainly does not in people.
            Richard laughs
       ptw: No I don't agree.
   Richard: I'm just imagining it.  People could live longer by observing each 
other.
       ptw: Observing that I am alive is quite different from observing I am 43.
   Richard: Hmm.  This was originally proposed as a way of dealing with the 
problem of repeatedly collecting some cohort of objects that were stubbornly 
surviving and defying the prediction.
       ptw: liveness != probability of living
       drj: actually Tucker, it does in people.  Your life expectancy increases 
as you get older, not as quickly as you get older though
       drj: life expectancy does not increase however
       ptw: My life expectancy correlates with my age tho, not the time since I 
was last known to be alive.
   Richard: Isn't the generational hypothesis rather like the infant mortality 
observation?
       drj: er, I don't understand the difference between age and age when last 
observed alive
     sheep: Gavin, look on Zaarin in a shared folder called downloads. 
   Richard: Right, isn't that just a-t?
       ptw: Are they not one and the same?  Liklihood of death decays 
exponentially.
   Richard: I saw you alive at age 43 (a-t) therefore I conclude that you're 
the long-living type?
   Richard: And not an infant mortality after all.
   Richard: If I see someone alive at age 2 I might have a different estimate, 
perhaps?
   Richard: If I wait three years (without seeing you) then my estimate might 
depend on how long it was since I last saw you alive.  Is that not valid?
    GavinM: sheep, checking now.
     sheep: do you see it ? 
       ptw: You've confused me!
   Richard: If I see someone at age 2 and wait forty years my estimate might be 
lower.
   Richard: Gotcha!
   Richard: I was confused yesterday too.
   Richard: I'm still not sure.
       drj: I'm confused too now
            Richard goes for stimulants
       ptw: I am getting nowhere on my edit session.  I wonder how relevant 
this design.tool is now, anyways?
            sheep has eye break gets more coffer
            sheep drops coffer and gets coffee
       ptw: You've confused me because I thought a was the objects "current" 
age.  That is, the object is 43 and we have not buried it.
       ptw: Now you say a is the last time we did not bury the object (2) and 
it's been 41 years, should we be building a coffin?
       drj: we need some defs
    GavinM: Sheep, I see it.  INstalling.
       ptw: t == 41
       ptw: Yes.
   Richard: ptw: Perhaps you should talk to sheep about design.tool before 
taking it further.
       ptw: design.tool:  I think so.
       ptw: d.t:  when sheep comes to 1cc?
   Richard: Umm.  a is the age now.  t is the time since last known to be 
alive.  If I see a baby at age 2, then forty years later a=42 and t=40.  I have 
a high estimate of infant mortality so I think S(42,40) is low.
   Richard: But, S(42,2) is high, by the same token*.
     sheep: Richard was talking about week of 16th of June, I'm cheching this 
with my social sectrary
   Richard: * see relevant Dave Barry column.
   Richard: sheep: It might be a midweek trip, say 18th for one week, if that's 
OK with you.  drj has limitations.
       drj: that a comedown
       drj: er, what a comedown, I meant
     sheep: hang on I'm missing something here 
     sheep:  drj has limitations
   Richard: sheep: Negotiate with drj and ptw about dates, but I recommend 
something around that time.
     sheep:  drj has limitations ?>???
   Richard: He can't fly or see through things, I've noticed.
   Richard: And S(42,0) is 1.
       ptw: disagree
   Richard: OK, where's the flaw?
            sheep off back in a few mins
       ptw: Is S "is alive", or "is likely to stay alive"?
   Richard: Just "is alive", I think.
   Richard: Yes, that's right.  We're trying to assess the benefit of 
collecting _now_.
       ptw: But the only way to calculate S(x,0) is to collect.
   Richard: If collection is instantaneous then I have S(x,0) just after 
collection, yes.  The question is, is S(x,n) useful for various n?  e.g. I've 
collected this recently, and it was alive despite being old.
    GavinM: Sheep, the client setup window is amazing.
       drj: we may have an S' which is an estimation of S however
   Richard: For example, if I only have S(a) then I might believe that 90% of a 
generation is dead even though I've just found that it was not, and try to 
collect it again.  Maybe I should, but it doesn't seem right somehow.
       ptw: t is more like an estimate of the accuracy of a, not another 
dimension.
       ptw: Does anyone in this group actually know anything about probability 
and statistics?  I don't.  But I bet someone who did could solve this is a sec.
       drj: they way I think about it...
       drj: s(a, 0) is the "global" assumptions or eetimates about how things 
die
       drj: er, scratch
   Richard: I wish I knew some maths.  It's all because I moved house at the 
age of 12.  Mumble mumble.
       drj: s(a, a) is the "global" assumptions or estimates about how things 
die.
    GavinM: I know something abour P&S, buI hen't e payg attention.
   Richard: I could've been a mathematician!  I could've been a contender.
    GavinM: Sheep, How did you configure it?
   Richard: gavin&sheep: May I suggest another channel for discussing IRC 
client setup?
       drj: s(a, t) for small t represents local information, as time 
progresses, we should expect this to approach s(a,a)
       ptw: Error(S(a,t)) == S(Error(a), 0) or something

       drj: hmm.  I'm not sure how to reason about the error though.
   GavinM2: The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy black dog.
   Richard: S(a,t) tends towards S(a) as a tends towards t.
   Richard: er, t tends towards a.  Sorry.

above)

some distance from it)
