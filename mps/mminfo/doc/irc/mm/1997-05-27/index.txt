.gavinm.09-23-04: Hello.

.drj.09-40-22: hello

.gavinm.09-40-39: ldisk on deja-vu is full  again

.drj.09-49-21: so I not

.drj.09-49-33: I just tried to write a massive binary mail message into it.

.gavinm.10-28-43: That'll larn you.

.drj.11-20-21: can't you drag the file onto lynx to view it?

.gavinm.11-38-14: Apparently I can drag URLs, but not files.

.drj.11-43-21: so do a get info first

.gavinm.11-44-05: h.

.gavinm.11-44-09: Ah.

.gavinm.11-44-47: I've never understood why PCs (and sometimes Macs) want three 
slashes after "file:".

.drj.11-45-16: I am trying to compile ircII

.drj.11-45-53: only had to intervene once so far (to tell it where the flex - 
shudder - binaries are).  Bleedin' Linux programmers.

.gavinm.11-46-49: The IRC server and client I compiled are obsessed with 
binding the installation directory of the binaries as early as possible.

.nematode.12-02-03: spong

.gavinm.13-19-40: Maybe we should do a "du" on all MM disks to IRC every hour.

.gavinm.13-20-03: More seriously, we could easily use IRC channels for logging 
information. 

.gavinm.13-21-13: It suddenly occurs to me that I haven't checked whether 
LogBot would log something it said itself.  It all depends on whether the 
server would echo it back or not.

.drj.13-34-49: Mmmm

.drj.13-35-06: but we can use script and cat and tee and all sorts of other 
things to lof information

.gavinm.13-38-03: Perhaps we should just mail mm if the usages exceed some 
fraction (or asymtotic fractions) with some hysteresis.

.gavinm.13-38-36: BTW, does anyone actually want this Atom?  I don't want to be 
responsible for cluttering the room up.

.drj.13-39-46: hmmm

.gavinm.14-28-15: Regarding a TV, I only have a large flakey one spare, and I'm 
disinclined to lug it in and retune it. 

.drj.14-42-47: it wqas richard wot asked for it.

.drj.14-43-19: though I have a composite video monitor (er, in Chapel) and know 
how to add a composite video out to the atom (probably)

.gavinm.14-49-52: You sound better placed to help Richard out with that, then.

.gavinm.14-57-57: How about I give you a lift up to Hamilton for the weekend 
sometime, and drop by Chapel en-route.

.drj.15-06-51: perhaps

.drj.15-07-27: I have a good reason to be in Stirling on August 16th

.gavinm.15-15-36: I think Stirling is the best part of an hour north of Glasgow.

.drj.15-25-52: is okay, galsgow would be fine.

.drj.15-25-56: won't be in edit.

.gavinm.15-26-17: I don't know why I bother.

.drj.16-17-04: take it up with my manager

.drj.16-18-12: 'lo

.lmb.16-18-22: Test.

.lmb.16-18-50: hi, all.

.richard.16-18-59: Hello.
