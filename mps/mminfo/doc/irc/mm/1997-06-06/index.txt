.gavinm!gavinm@terpsichore.long.harlequin.co.uk.12-51-59: What do people think 
of the new LogBot?  I had a late-night hacking session and reimplemented it 
with a generic parser and method dispatch.  I like Perl.

.drj!~drj@trillian.long.harlequin.co.uk.12-53-19: the new logbot is certainly 
more amusing.

.gavinm!gavinm@terpsichore.long.harlequin.co.uk.12-53-39: We aim to please.

.richard!richard@dynamic-house1.long.harlequin.co.uk.12-54-09: Are we LOGGED 
yet?

.drj!~drj@trillian.long.harlequin.co.uk.12-54-19: it should utter something 
once per day or whenever anyone joins whichever is the more frequent.

.gavinm!gavinm@terpsichore.long.harlequin.co.uk.12-54-29: In fact, the old 
LogBot only logged messages, not joins, leaves, or topics.

.gavinm!gavinm@terpsichore.long.harlequin.co.uk.12-55-10: Richard, what did it 
tell you?

.gavinm!gavinm@terpsichore.long.harlequin.co.uk.12-55-30: DRJ, maybe.

.gavinm!gavinm@terpsichore.long.harlequin.co.uk.12-56-40: I've just realised: 
If you KICK LogBot, it will never rejoin that channel.  Is that a bug or a 
feature?

.nickb!~nickb@trillian.long.harlequin.co.uk.13-07-32: Don't you mean "Is that a 
BUG or a FEATURE"?

.nickb!~nickb@trillian.long.harlequin.co.uk.13-08-02: Am I CONSING yet?

.nickb!~nickb@trillian.long.harlequin.co.uk.13-34-22: I am a traffic light, and 
Alan Ginzberg kidnapped my laundry in 1927!

.nickb!~nickb@trillian.long.harlequin.co.uk.13-34-26: Possibly your inhibitions 
are related to this.

.gavinm!gavinm@terpsichore.long.harlequin.co.uk.14-13-33: I tried to find an

.richard!richard@dynamic-house1.long.harlequin.co.uk.14-53-24: I was just 
trying to phone you.

.richard!richard@dynamic-house1.long.harlequin.co.uk.14-53-29: But the phones 
are broken from Longstanton.

.drj!~drj@trillian.long.harlequin.co.uk.14-53-39: hello lmb

.richard!richard@dynamic-house1.long.harlequin.co.uk.14-53-49: I sent you mail 
anyway.  It's about version.product.plough

.drj!~drj@trillian.long.harlequin.co.uk.14-53-49: how are your business trip 
plans going?

.richard!richard@dynamic-house1.long.harlequin.co.uk.14-53-52: I'd like to put 
together a skeletal reference manual.

.lmb!~lmb@trillian.long.harlequin.co.uk.14-53-59: mine?  dead in the water.

.richard!richard@dynamic-house1.long.harlequin.co.uk.14-54-09: Sorry, I'm 
inundating you a bit.

.richard!richard@dynamic-house1.long.harlequin.co.uk.14-54-19: George filled me 
in a bit on the work permit situation.

.richard!richard@dynamic-house1.long.harlequin.co.uk.14-54-28: I still don't 
know why he was worried about my mail, though.

.drj!~drj@trillian.long.harlequin.co.uk.14-54-29: oh.  so you're not getting a 
visa or several trips?

.lmb!~lmb@trillian.long.harlequin.co.uk.14-54-31: richard: yes, i saw.  i'm not 
quite sure what you want.  i can certainly edit what we have and put it into 
framemaker.

.drj!~drj@trillian.long.harlequin.co.uk.14-54-39: which mail richard?

.lmb!~lmb@trillian.long.harlequin.co.uk.14-54-46: drj: need a work permit for 
the several trips idea.

.richard!richard@dynamic-house1.long.harlequin.co.uk.14-54-49: Leah, no, just 
text will do.

.drj!~drj@trillian.long.harlequin.co.uk.14-54-52: ah

.richard!richard@dynamic-house1.long.harlequin.co.uk.14-54-59: drj: Mail saying 
that it would be a good idea if Leah stayed.

.drj!~drj@trillian.long.harlequin.co.uk.14-55-01: so the idea has been 
abandonded all together ?

.drj!~drj@trillian.long.harlequin.co.uk.14-55-10: r, I recall

.lmb!~lmb@trillian.long.harlequin.co.uk.14-55-19: as far as i can tell.

.richard!richard@dynamic-house1.long.harlequin.co.uk.14-56-09: What I'd like is 
the best and most complete text reference manual we can put together in, say, 
the next few weeks.

.richard!richard@dynamic-house1.long.harlequin.co.uk.14-56-22: If we glue 
together what we have now that would do, but it would be good to make it 
coherent, if incomplete.

.richard!richard@dynamic-house1.long.harlequin.co.uk.14-57-29: So I guess I'm 
asking how much we can expect to get done.

.lmb!~lmb@trillian.long.harlequin.co.uk.14-57-39: i can certainly put some time 
into it, but i'll need someone on the technical side to look over it, to make 
sure it hangs together.

.richard!richard@dynamic-house1.long.harlequin.co.uk.14-57-49: Can you give us 
a day in the next few weeks to do that?

.richard!richard@dynamic-house1.long.harlequin.co.uk.14-57-51: OK, we could 
arrange a review.

.lmb!~lmb@trillian.long.harlequin.co.uk.14-57-59: sure.

.richard!richard@dynamic-house1.long.harlequin.co.uk.14-58-09: OK, good.

.lmb!~lmb@trillian.long.harlequin.co.uk.15-02-40: ken says i'll get a trip over 
during the last two weeks  before release.  i assume i could stay longer and 
talk to mm.

.richard!richard@dynamic-house1.long.harlequin.co.uk.15-05-18: Leah, I'm going 
to schedule a change document and assign you.  You'll need to follow 
proc.assignment.*.

.drj!~drj@trillian.long.harlequin.co.uk.15-05-21: gavinm, why does logbot 
sometimes not find a joke?

.lmb!~lmb@trillian.long.harlequin.co.uk.15-05-31: okay.  thanks.

deadline?  or is that in the change document?

.drj!~drj@trillian.long.harlequin.co.uk.15-14-12: it's likely to be quite a 
large piece of work isn't it?

.drj!~drj@trillian.long.harlequin.co.uk.15-14-22: and amenable to breaking up 
and being approved separately?

.drj!~drj@trillian.long.harlequin.co.uk.15-14-32: and therefore could be 
approved by multiple people?

.richard!richard@dynamic-house1.long.harlequin.co.uk.15-18-02: Leah: Release 
will be 9th July (about 4 weeks from now)

.richard!richard@dynamic-house1.long.harlequin.co.uk.15-18-12: (I'm on the

.drj!~drj@trillian.long.harlequin.co.uk.15-25-04: right what?

.richard!richard@dynamic-house1.long.harlequin.co.uk.15-25-35: OK, so Leah, the 
release is going to be on the 9th, but we should have this stuff ready before 
then, obviously, so that it can go through approval, and so on.  I suggest 
getting it together by 1997-06-20 (Friday, two weeks hence).

.richard!richard@dynamic-house1.long.harlequin.co.uk.15-25-54: Then we can fix 
up any problems in good time.

.lmb!~lmb@trillian.long.harlequin.co.uk.15-26-04: that should be no problem.

.richard!richard@dynamic-house1.long.harlequin.co.uk.15-26-14: drj: Right, stop 
interrupting me as soon as I get off the phone so that I can type the rest of 
the sentence into IRC!

.richard!richard@dynamic-house1.long.harlequin.co.uk.15-26-53: I'm off home.

.lmb!~lmb@trillian.long.harlequin.co.uk.15-26-53: i don't have anything planned 
next weekend. :)

.drj!~drj@trillian.long.harlequin.co.uk.15-26-54: which sentence would that 
be?  You said "Right.".  Looks like a well formed sentence to me.

.lmb!~lmb@trillian.long.harlequin.co.uk.15-26-56: bye, richard.

.drj!~drj@trillian.long.harlequin.co.uk.15-27-04: bye

.gavinm!gavinm@terpsichore.long.harlequin.co.uk.15-37-05: DRJ, LogBot gets its 
jokes from an HTTP Yow server.  This seems to fail at some times of day.  I'd 
prefer a local joke server, but a quick search couldn't locate me one.

.drj!~drj@trillian.long.harlequin.co.uk.15-37-45: Hmm.  Must be in the emacs 
distribution somewhere.  M-x yow

.gavinm!gavinm@terpsichore.long.harlequin.co.uk.15-38-37: True, I found that, 
but couldn't grok how to get at it.

.drj!~drj@trillian.long.harlequin.co.uk.15-42-06: so how do we use yduj's

.lmb!~lmb@trillian.long.harlequin.co.uk.15-43-36: or you could mail her.

.lmb!~lmb@trillian.long.harlequin.co.uk.15-43-39: it's dead boring.

.gavinm!gavinm@terpsichore.long.harlequin.co.uk.15-49-17: Roget's does not 
appear to list "cohort".

.drj!~drj@trillian.long.harlequin.co.uk.15-50-17: feeble

.gavinm!gavinm@terpsichore.long.harlequin.co.uk.15-50-37: "cohortative" means 
"encouraging".

.gavinm!gavinm@terpsichore.long.harlequin.co.uk.15-50-57: "cohort" is a Roman 
military term, so there may be a Latin adjectival form.

.drj!~drj@trillian.long.harlequin.co.uk.15-50-57: are cohort and cohortative 
related?

.gavinm!gavinm@terpsichore.long.harlequin.co.uk.15-51-07: Not directly, no.

.drj!~drj@trillian.long.harlequin.co.uk.15-51-09: cohort should also be a 
census term.

.gavinm!gavinm@terpsichore.long.harlequin.co.uk.15-54-18: They're both from 
Latin, so there is presumably some commonality.

.drj!~drj@trillian.long.harlequin.co.uk.16-04-19: so either use the contents of

.drj!~drj@trillian.long.harlequin.co.uk.16-04-50: `emacs -nw --batch --eval 
'(princ data-directory)'`/yow.lines

.drj!~drj@trillian.long.harlequin.co.uk.16-04-50.1: or

'(princ(yow))' 2>/dev/null

.drj!~drj@trillian.long.harlequin.co.uk.16-08-40: using emacs directly saves 
you from having to parse yow.lines (which has NULs in.)

.drj!~drj@trillian.long.harlequin.co.uk.16-09-00: _and_ the person who wrote it 
doesn't know how to spell NUL.

.gavinm!gavinm@terpsichore.long.harlequin.co.uk.16-10-21: I often mistype 
"brainstorm" as "bairnstorm".  It's a compelling image.

emacs "M-x yow" is batch mode?

which does just that

.gavinm!gavinm@terpsichore.long.harlequin.co.uk.16-21-44: That's probably less

.gavinm!gavinm@terpsichore.long.harlequin.co.uk.17-22-44: Hmm.

.drj!~drj@trillian.long.harlequin.co.uk.17-23-15: e.g. richard decided about 6 
weeks ago that at least sheep (and possible me and gavinm) should go to the 
states in mid june.  postulating week beginning 1997-06-16.  Has he had time to 
do anything about that yet?  Noooo.

.gavinm!gavinm@terpsichore.long.harlequin.co.uk.17-23-24: I was chatting to my 
neighbour the other day.  He said he was looking for another job, but didn't 
want to be doing coding.

when?

.gavinm!gavinm@terpsichore.long.harlequin.co.uk.17-25-10: I was once listening 
to the Kinks (as I am now) when my landlord asked me "Why are they called 'The 
Kinks'?"

.lmb!~lmb@trillian.long.harlequin.co.uk.17-25-14: would the mm manager *have*

.drj!~drj@trillian.long.harlequin.co.uk.17-25-24: uhuh.  That would be good.  
Have you seen any of the exhibit yet lmb?
