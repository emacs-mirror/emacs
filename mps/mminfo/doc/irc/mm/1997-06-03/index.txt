.drj.07-20-28: ping

.lmb.10-01-01: morning, all.

.drj.10-07-59: hello

.lmb.11-20-42: thanks for your format protocol material, drj.

.drj.11-21-33: got any suggestions for the overall structure?  It's essential 
that this document be as clear as possible.

.lmb.11-21-54: it's not clear how protocols should be documented.  when i 
worked on the format and allocation point protocols myself, they seemed to have 
somewhat different structures.

.drj.11-22-02: the format is exceedingly subtle and exceedingly critical for 
speed (for clients defining their own object format)

.lmb.11-22-31: i think one thing in common should be a summary of the main 
points of the protocol.

.lmb.11-23-00: it's interesting to see how you've structured it.  it's very 
different from the organization i used, i think.

.gavinm.11-23-24: Hello.

.lmb.11-24-03: hi, gavin.

.gavinm.11-24-19: So where are you?

.lmb.11-24-37: the hall.

.gavinm.11-25-58: Ah.

.lmb.11-27-13: i think we'll have to document a few protocols, and then come up 
with some sort of template (if, in fact, that's possible), and then put it 
through the review process.

.lmb.11-27-26: so, basically, you've been a guinea pig, drj.  sorry.

.drj.11-28-04: I haven't finished yet.  vast swathes of doc yet to be written

.lmb.11-29-44: on formats??

.drj.11-29-49: yes

.lmb.11-31-55: but the basic organization is there, right?

.drj.11-32-44: er, well I guess.

.lmb.11-32-47: btw, nouns in the reference doc should probably not be 
capitalized.

.gavinm.11-33-43: Even if we're using a common word with a specialist meaning 
(as "format")?

.lmb.11-34-22: my inclination is not to capitalize them.

.drj.11-34-33: I think so too.  Is the doc going to have a glossary?  In the 
format doc for example, the first time "reference", "pool class", "pool" are 
mentioned it would be good to typographically distinguish them to clue the 
reader that more extensive references ...

.lmb.11-34-40: i'll see what other apps do before i commit myself, though.

.drj.11-34-44: for these terms are availanble.  what a sad client

.drj.11-35-02: it has a line width restriction.  they should use a GC

.lmb.11-35-06: yes, we'll have a glossary.  see "design.product.doc.ref-man" 
and "~.guide" (or some such).

.lmb.11-38-28: oops, brb.

.lmb.13-55-28: quiet here today.

.drj.13-59-18: richard  left his tamagotchi unattended

.drj.13-59-23: I am rescuing it

.gavinm.14-07-50: It's a bit cooler today.

.drj.14-18-35: so, what about some model GC algorithms in the doc?  Would help 
us explain what is going on.

.lmb.14-20-52: where did richard go, btw?  why'd he leave his tama?

.richard.14-31-34: I went to give Tucker his performance review.

.richard.14-31-44: In a moment I'm going to the MM product naming meeting at 
the Hall.

.richard.14-32-00: Chop chop busy busy work work bang bang.

.lmb.14-32-15: taking the bus home?  if you miss it, david williams might be 
able to give you (and me) a ride home.

.richard.14-32-43: I have my bicycle.

.richard.14-32-49: (And will bring it to Hall)

.drj.14-33-38: I have just looked at your format doc lmb 
(meeting.doc.1997-01-17.format

.drj.14-34-23: it is (modulo some minor bugs) excellent.

.drj.14-34-37: it is almost exactly the doc that I haven't written yet for the 
format protocol

.lmb.14-36-04: thank you, drj.  we can work on integrating them.

.lmb.14-36-22: and pulling in info that might have been missed.

.lmb.14-37-10: please comment on the bugs somewhere (in mail is probably best).

.drj.14-37-42: I will comment on the bugs.

.lmb.14-39-58: ta.

.lmb.14-40-50: i need to clean it up a lot, as well.  iirc, there are a lot of 
asides and "the doc should have this" that need to come out.

.lmb.15-37-11: is everyone leaving now?

.gavinm.15-45-05: David's gone.  Nick and I are still here.

.lmb.16-02-23: i'm definitely leaving tomorrow.  in case you were wondering.

.gavinm.16-15-27: Where for?

.lmb.16-16-26: the us.

.lmb.16-16-37: current plan is to bring me over for two weeks each month until 
watson is done.

.lmb.16-16-47: plus a bit to ramp back up on the MM doc.

.lmb.16-16-51: ACTION sighs

.gavinm.16-33-28: They're flying you to the UK for two weeks every month?  For 
how long?

.lmb.16-33-52: watson is scheduled to be done on sept. 2.

.lmb.16-34-13: they think it's cheaper than getting me another work permit.

.gavinm.16-35-04: I'd protest if I were you.  How much does a work permit cost?

.lmb.16-41-15: about a thousand pounds.  plus lodging and a plane ticket.

.lmb.16-41-24: about L600 and L500 respectively.

.gavinm.16-43-11: Er, but they'd have to pay lodging and plane anyway, wouldn't 
they.

.lmb.16-44-47: yes.  let's see...lodging is L38/night * 14 nights * 3 months = 
L1500.

.lmb.16-44-54: cheaper to put me in a bedsit, by far.

.lmb.16-45-05: sorry, that's roughly L1600.

.lmb.16-45-52: i rack up about L15 in food per day.  that's roughly L650.

.lmb.16-45-58: and i couldn't cook in a hotel.

.lmb.16-46-26: and they wouldn't pay my food if i had a work permit; i think it 
would screw up my US taxes.

.gavinm.16-47-15: Um, whatever.  It's still a bit naff for you, but.

.lmb.16-47-30: talk to you on thursday....
