INTRODUCTION

.scope: This document represents the key process area of Training Program, a 
key area of Level 3 of the Capability Maturity Model, as described in 
paper.sei93.

.readership: This document is intended for anyone involved in project.process.

.purpose: The purpose of the Training Program key process area is to develop 
the skills and knowledge of individuals so they can perform their roles 
effectively and efficiently.

Training Program involves first identifying the training needed by the 
organization, projects, and individuals, then developing or procuring training 
to address the identified needs.

Each software project evaluates its current and future skill needs and 
determines how these skills will be obtained. Some skills are effectively and 
efficiently imparted through informal vehicles (e.g., on-the-job training and 
informal mentoring), whereas other skills need more formal training vehicles 
(e.g., classroom training and guided self-study) to be effectively and 
efficiently imparted. The appropriate vehicles are selected and used.

This key process area covers the practices for the group performing the 
training function. The practices identifying the specific training topics 
(i.e., knowledge or skill needed) are contained in the Ability to Perform 
common feature of the individual key process areas.
