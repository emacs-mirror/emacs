INTRODUCTION

.scope: This document represents the key process area of Organization Process 
Focus, a key area of Level 3 of the Capability Maturity Model, as described in 
paper.sei93.

.readership: This document is intended for anyone involved in project.process.

.purpose: The purpose of Organization Process Focus is to establish the 
organizational responsibility for software process activities that improve the 
organization's overall software process capability.

Organization Process Focus involves developing and maintaining an understanding 
of the organization's and projects' software processes and coordinating the 
activities to assess, develop, maintain, and improve these processes.

The organization provides the long-term commitments and resources to coordinate 
the development and maintenance of the software processes across current and 
future software projects via a group such as a software engineering process 
group. This group is responsible for the organization's software process 
activities. It is specifically responsible for the development and maintenance 
of the organization's standard software process and related process assets (as 
described in the Organization Process Definition key process area), and it 
coordinates the process activities with the software projects.

coordinated across the organization.

.goal.strength: The strengths and weaknesses of the software processes used are 
identified relative to a process standard.

.goal.plan: Organization-level process development and improvement activities 
are planned.
