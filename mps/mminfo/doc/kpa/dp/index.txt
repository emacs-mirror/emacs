INTRODUCTION

.scope: This document represents the key process area of Defect Prevention, a 
key area of Level 5 of the Capability Maturity Model, as described in 
paper.sei93.

.readership: This document is intended for anyone involved in project.process.

.purpose: The purpose of Defect Prevention is to identify the cause of defects 
and prevent them from recurring.

Defect Prevention involves analyzing defects that were encountered in the past 
and taking specific actions to prevent the occurrence of those types of defects 
in the future. The defects may have been identified on other projects as well 
as in earlier stages or tasks of the current project. Defect prevention 
activities are also one mechanism for spreading lessons learned between 
projects.

Trends are analyzed to track the types of defects that have been encountered 
and to identify defects that are likely to recur. Based on an understanding of 
the project's defined software process and how it is implemented (as described 
in the Integrated Software Management and Software Product Engineering key 
process areas), the root causes of the defects and the implications of the 
defects for future activities are determined.

Both the project and the organization take specific actions to prevent 
recurrence of the defects. Some of the organizational actions may be handled as 
described in the Process Change Management key process area.


GOALS

.goal.plan: Defect prevention activities are planned.

.goal.seek: Common causes of defects are sought out and identified.

.goal.eliminate: Common causes of defects are prioritized and systematically 
eliminated.
