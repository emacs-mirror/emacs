SUMMARY

Co-operate (or at least co-exist) with other "components" which might
exist in an application.  The term "component" is ill-defined, so we
take a conservative view and anticipate the ways in which other
components might operate.  In particular, we require that our system
co-exists with other instances of itself without being explicitly
aware of them.


DESCRIPTION

- small
- conservative use of features
  - of the OS
  - of the languages
  - of the environment
- small interfaces, well controlled
- act like the ideal C library (assumes C is the lingua franca)
- don't assume control
  - of address space
  - of CPU
  - of threads
  - of the environment in general
  - of anything much
- don't be whacky
- sufficient call interface


JUSITIFICATION

- adaptability to environments
- portability
- quality
- future-proofing: the definition of "component" might resolve
