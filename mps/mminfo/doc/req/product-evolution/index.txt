INTRODUCTION

.purpose: This document specifies the requirements the MM group have of a 
Product Evolution System.

.def: For the purpose of this document, "release", "request", and "change" have 
the meanings defined for Darwin, unless otherwise specified.


REQUIREMENTS

.release.request: It should be possible to determine, for a specific release, 
which requests are fulfilled in that release.  This is particularly important 
for "leaf" releases.

.release.insert: It should be possible to insert a release, particularly 
between the last closed release and the next release, with automatic 
inheritance of closed changes.

.product.dependence: It should be possible to model relationships between 
products, specifically that one product is released with a specific version of 
another product; in particular, it should model requests that are created in 
one product, but result in a change to another.

.release.patch: It should be possible to delegate responsibility for the 
management of patch releases for specific products.

.release.none: It should be possible to track requests and development for 
products that do not have monolithic releases in the conventional sense.

.work-flow: It should support workflow; specifically, data entry should 
strongly support people in entering necessary information at various stages.
