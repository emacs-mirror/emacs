req.dylan.prot.abort requires that the Dylan memory manager "shall never
abort the process".  The MPS complies with this, except that the default
assertion handler invokes mps_lib_abort.  In the supplied plinth,
mps_lib_abort invokes abort.

It is necessary for the client to replace either the assertion handler
(using mps_assert_install) or mps_lib_abort in the plinth, in order to
ensure compliance.

Note that the MPS may also invoke abort as a result of resignalling a
signal in simulation of SIG_DFL.  This is specific to platform.su, and does
not currently affect Dylan.
