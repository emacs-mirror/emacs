INTRODUCTION

.scope:

.background: See analysis.plan and book.gilb88 pp227-248.


PROCEDURE

.req: Renegotiate requirements as necessary.

.spread: Construct a spreadsheet showing the new requirements against releases 
and plot the degree to which the previous releases have met them.

.diff: Starting with the release which most closely satisfies the requirements, 
list the requirements which are not met.

.analyse: Analyse each one in order to estimate the work needed to satisfy it.  
The total will give you an estimate of the work needed to meet the requirements.

.feasibility: Use this information to (re-)assess the feasibility of the whole 
project.

.prio: Prioritize the requirements, putting those which have greatest value to 
the client but lowest cost first.

.risk: Also, seek to eliminate risk as early as possible.

.next: Define the next release to occur as soon as possible and have maximum 
value to the client, working on the principle of "how little can we do?" 
(book.gilb88 pp227-248).

.future: Decide on some future releases beyond that in order to get early 
warnings of risks, but don't spend too much time on them.

You now have a set of requirements to be met by the next release.

.detail: Analyse these in more detail to discover and specify the work to be 
done.

.schedule: Schedule the work.

.execute: Execute it, tracking progress and adjusting the specifications as 
necessary.

.release: When the work is done, release.

.loop: Then start again.
