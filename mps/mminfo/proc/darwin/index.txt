GENERAL PROCEDURAL NOTES

.notes: These notes apply to all procedures.

.explain: Don't be terse and unclear just because you're the one who's going to 
be reading something.  Some others will almost certainly have to look at it 
later.  Possibly _much_ later.  Make it easy for them.

.integrity: Do not fill in any fields except those described in the 
procedures.  Other fields have undefined purpose -- leave them unused and 
empty.  If and when they come into use we don't want the database to be full of 
bogus values.

.name-date: When adding paragraphs such as in a description or report field, 
always append your username and the date.


PROCEDURES

.proc: These procedures are classified by document type, and ordered roughly in 
workflow order. 

In many cases, these procedures can be folded together; for example, a request 
can be defined, planned, and scheduled in one go.  There's nothing wrong with 
this, but there are steps in each procedure it is necessary to follow, and it 
is wise to follow all the steps in the procedures in case you are interrupted.
