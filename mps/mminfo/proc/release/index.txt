A generic version will be created in due course.]

.virus: If you're releasing binaries on Windows or Mac platforms, do a virus 
scan on all of them (including third-party binaries).  Yes, you really want to 
do this after packaging the release, to minimise the chances of last-minute 
infection.  .virus.win: On Windows, you can use the Inoculan scanner installed 
on all Windows machines.  Start it, and choose Local Scanner, then deselect the 
default targets, select the directories holding the executables and start the 
scanner.

.test.overnight: The tip of each current release branch in tested every night 
by the overnight build.  .test.overnight.start: If this is the first release on 
a release branch, you will want to start overnight tests for it.  Refer to 
design.buildsys.overnight for details.  .test.overnight.stop: You might also 
want to consider stopping tests for one of the older branches for the same 
product, if they are no longer going to be modified.
