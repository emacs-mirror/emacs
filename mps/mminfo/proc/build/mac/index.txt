INTRODUCTION

.scope: This document describes how to build the MPS on a Macintosh.

.readership: This document is intended for any MPS developer.


REQUIREMENTS

.req: In order to build the MPS you will need:
.req.os: A Mac running System 7.x (what values of x work?) or System 8.y where 
0<=y<=6 (older version of DEV didn't work with y>1, but I've spoken to Peter 
and the current tip of trunk will work up to and including MacOS 8.6. -- rit 
1999-08-31)

.req.dev: The ScriptWorks development environment known as DEV.
.req.hope: HOPE.  Harlequin's source code control system.
.req.source: The MPS sources.

.os.what: You can find out what version of the system software you have by 
using the "About This Computer" option on the Apple menu when using the Finder.

.dev.where: DEV is stored in HOPE.  .dev.overview: A DEV overview is available: 
SW_macdev!DEV.overview.readme
.dev.install: Installation instructions for DEV: SW_macdev!DEV.install.readme

.hope.where: The Macintosh HOPE client is available via FTP (so you'd better 
have TCP/IP working).  See the instructions in the Installing topic in the Hope 
Reference Manual: .

.source.where: The sources are downloaded from HOPE as part of this procedure.


PROCEDURE

.source.acquire: The source are in HOPE.  They are in a single compound called 
MMsrc.

.source.acquire.cd: Using hope cd to a suitable directory for checking out the 
sources:

cd McCaque:drj:mm-brisling:

.source.acquire.co: checkout the sources.  A directory called "src" will be 
created.

co -compound MMsrc -branch MM_epcore_brisling_1 -missing-dir create

.dev: Now we switch to using DEV (MPW).

.dev.directory: In DEV set the directory to the one you just created in the 
checkout:

directory McCaque:drj:mm-brisling:src:

[This section taken from MMsrc!s7ppac:Makefile -- drj 1999-01-25]

.dev.directory.again: set the directory to the Macintosh platform you want to 
build for (this currently (1999-01-25) is either s7ppac or s760ac):

directory :s7ppac:

.dev.build: Build the stuff (currently (1999-01-25) there is no option about 
what to build):

BuildProgram -d Variety mmsw

.dev.created: 

This creates (amongst other things), the required files

mmsw_{Variety}.o

So currently (1999-01-25) that's:

mmsw_HI.o
mmsw_TI.o
mmsw_WE.o
