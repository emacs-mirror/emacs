.intro: See proc.darwin for scope, readership, update procedure, and additional 
procedural notes.  See also guide.assignment.

.check.release: Check that the relevant release has status "Development".  Note 
that it is _not_ forbidden to do some development work before the release is in 
"Development", and in this case this procedure must be deferred.

.open: Open the change document and enter edit mode.

.find: Find the relevant assignment.

.check.dev: Check that you are the assigned developer.

.status: Set the assignment status to "Implementing".

.close: Save and close the change document.  Give a change comment such as "Now 
implementing assignment N".

.record: You'll need a record of what you did during this assignment.  Start it 
now.  See proc.assignment.end.record.

[How does this relate to proc.dev.branch?
Often a code change is a branch.
Decide (how?)
Co-ordinate with other assigned developers to use same branch (maybe).
Execute proc (not all of it)

[ Need to write to darwin-discussion about apparent consequent of this 
procedure on the request becoming "Active". -- Richard 1997-03-14]
[ If solution has been implemented on another branch, should check approval 
comments.  gavinm 1998-07-28 ]
