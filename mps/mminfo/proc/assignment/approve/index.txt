.intro: See proc.darwin for scope, readership, update procedure, and additional 
procedural notes.  See also guide.assignment.

.approval: Do the approval, and decide to accept or reject the assignment.  
[Describe here or elsewhere?  Conceptual integrity; major defects; mini-review 
-- Richard 1997-03-14] [ The approver should consult any previous approval 
reports for the request, plus any past QA reports for the request.  GavinM 
1997-12-15 ]

.approval.regression: [Suggestion: The approver could check in Darwin (e.g. by 
searching for the name of the file changed, or for particular concepts, such as 
"buffer") to see what previous errors there have been in this or related code. 
The approver could check that the new changes do not reintroduce any earlier 
mistakes or break earlier mends. rit 1997-08-08]

.open: Open the change document and enter edit mode.

.report: Enter the approval report in the Approval Report field.  If rejecting 
the assignment, list all major defects that prevent approval and (optionally) 
any minor defects that might increase quality if fixed.

.status: Enter the new assignment status as "Complete" or "Reworking".

.last-change: If the change is now "Complete", and you notice that it is the 
last change in a release, the release could be ready for handover to QA and you 
could draw this to the attention of the Product Manager.  This is optional.

.close: Save and close the change document.  Give a change comment such as 
"Approved assignment N" or "Disapproved assignment N".
