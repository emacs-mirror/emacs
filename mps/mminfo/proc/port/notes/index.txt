Parameters
  Platform which is described as OOAACC (see platform naming??)
   where OO=short name for operating system e.g. o1 for OSF/1 (as in 
products/std/os.h)
   where AA=short name for architecture e.g. al for DEC alpha (as in 
products/std/arch.h)
   where CC=short name for build environment e.g. gc for Gnu CC
  e.g. o1algc

[these file names are inconsistent with proc.impl.build
  archspar.h not archsp.h
  arch68k.h  not arch68.h
  arch386.h  not arch86.h
  osmac.h    not osma.h
  oslinux.h  not osli.h
  ossunos.h  not su.h
  buildgcc.h not buildgc.h
  buildmvc.h not buildmv.h
also platform names are:
  fb not fbi3gc
  gc not sus8gc
  mv not nti3mv
build names do not appear to have standard short names listed anywhere 
]

Create tools/OOAACC/product.mak
  port existing one from similar (build) environment

To port product spong
  create product/spong/tools/OOAACC/makefile
    port from similar environment

Some products/tests depend on others
Most stuff depends on products/std which contains the architecture and os 
dependent stuff

New OS
products/std/
  create file include/osOO.h based on template include/ostm.h (dsm??) following 
instructions in template
products/mpm/
  include/arenast.h
    update this to select which arena structure implementation is to be used.
    currently arenstvm.h or arenstan.h
  src/vmOO.c
  If the ansi arena is not used have to create an OS specific one e.g. vmnt.h
  tools/OOAACC/makefile
    need to add vmOO to MODULES list if not using ansi arena 


New architecture
products/std/
  create file include/archAA.h based on template include/archtm.h (dsm??) 
following instructions in template

New build environment
products/std/
  include/buildenv.h?
  include/buildCC.h?

Process problems
The templates mentioned exist only in ~/dsm/h/mm/... 
they shouldn't be in directories with the code should they?
