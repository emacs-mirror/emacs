.intro: See proc.darwin for scope, readership, update procedure, and additional 
procedural notes.  See also guide.request.

.just: It is necessary for all requests to be analysed by someone who 
understands the details of the problem and can formulate possible solutions.  
It is often inappropriate for the Product Manager to do this.  This analysis 
(or definition) does not involve deciding when to schedule changes or whether 
to suspend or decline the request (see proc.request.plan).  See 
proc.request.define  for more details of this analysis.  

.open: Open the request document, and enter edit mode.

.status: Set the status field to "Defining".

.owner: Set the Owner field to the Notes name of the person who should do the 
defining.  This could be you.

.note: (optional) Append a note to the Request Description of the form:
  "[Bob, Can you define this please because you know all about frobs?  Sid 
1997-03-12]"
This tells the assigned definer a little more about what he's supposed to be 
doing with it.

.close: Save and close the request document.  Give a change comment such as 
"Assigned to XXX for defining".
