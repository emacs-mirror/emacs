              PROCEDURE FOR PLANNING CHANGES FOR A REQUEST

.intro: See proc.darwin for scope, readership, update procedure, and additional 
procedural notes.  See also guide.request.

.open: Open the relevant request document and enter edit mode.

.choose-rel: Choose a release or releases to satisfy the request in.  None of 
these releases should be an ancestor of another, nor should there be any 
duplicates in this set.  This is necessary to preserve the invariant that the 
same request can be met at most once in any release, either directly, or by 
inheritance.  Note that requests can never be satisfied by the combination of 
two changes.  These releases should similarly not clash with those of existing 
changes.

.create: Execute proc.change.create for each release chosen.

.define: If the request requires more defining:
  .define.status: Set the status to "Defining" (may already be there);
  .define.owner: Set the owner to the intended definer;
  .define.desc: Add an explanatory comment to the Request Description, 
addressed to the new owner;

.sched: Or if the request requires more changes to be scheduled: 
  .sched.status: Set the status to "Scheduling" (may already be there);
  .sched.owner: Set the owner to the intended planner;
  .sched.desc: Add an explanatory comment to the Request Description, addressed 
to the new owner;

.active: Otherwise, set the status to Active.

.close-request: Close and, if appropriate, save the request.  Enter a change 
description of the form "Assigned to XXX for more defining", "XXX will plan 
more changes", or "Now Active".
