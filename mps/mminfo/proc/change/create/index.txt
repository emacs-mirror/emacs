.intro: See proc.darwin for scope, readership, update procedure, and additional 
procedural notes.  See also guide.change.

.request: When executing this procedure, you should already have a request 
document open in edit mode (see proc.request.plan and proc.change.replan).

.create: Create a change document by pressing the "Create change document" 
button.  Choose to inherit contacts if asked.

.release: Select the appropriate release from the menu.  The menu contains 
releases for the product (inherited from the request), that are not yet in QA 
(or Closed).  If the menu doesn't contain the desired release, check that you 
inherited the correct product, and that the release has the correct status.

.check: Check that the product and request have been inherited correctly.

.rework: If executing this procedure from proc.change.replan, set rework to 
"Yes", otherwise leave as "No".

.qa.assign: QA assigned to (optional).  Set the QA assigned to field to the QA 
person reponsible.  If you're not sure, don't set it.

.contacts: The contacts list should be inherited from the request document (see 
.compose) and should follow the rules outlined in guide.change.contact.  

.close-change: Close and save the change.
