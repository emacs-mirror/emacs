.intro: See proc.darwin for scope, readership, update procedure, and additional 
procedural notes.  See also guide.change.

.open: Open the change document and enter edit mode.

.breakdown: Break the necessary change into distinct assignments.  [Need more 
about what to do if there are more than four parts.  EP split the 
request/change. -- GavinM 1997-03-13]

.desc: If there is more than one assignment, enter descriptions (see 
guide.change.desc) for each.

.status: Set the status of all assignments to "Waiting", even if you cannot 
fill in developer and approver.  This is important; otherwise the change's Dev 
Status will be calculated incorrectly.

.dev: For each assignment, assign a developer.  [Can this be deferred? -- 
GavinM 1997-03-13]

.app: For each assignment, assign an approver.  He should be distinct from the 
developer for that assignment.  This will usually be the Product Architect; 
this ensures conceptual integrity.  [Can this be deferred? -- GavinM 1997-03-13]

.qa: If the QA Assigned to has not been filled in, it may optionally be filled 
in at this stage.

.close: Save and close the change document.  Give a change comment like "Made 
assignments".
