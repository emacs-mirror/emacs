INTRODUCTION

.scope: This document describes the procedure for editing a document after 
review, and before exit.

.readership: This document is intended for anyone who may act as an editor in 
formal review.

.purpose: The primary purpose of performing edits is to eliminate major defects 
(see guide.review.class.major) from documents.


PROCEDURE


.resolve: The editor should attempt to resolve all issues in writing (see 
guide.review.edit).  It has been found to be most helpful to do this as you go 
along.

[Nothing here about timeliness of completion.  GavinM 1997-06-12]

.major: The editor should attempt to resolve major issues (see 
guide.review.class.major) first, as this gives the maximum benefit.

.quest: Questions should be answered by email to all participants and to a 
relevant logged mailing list such as "mm".

.imp: Improvement suggestions can be dealt with directly, escalated to an MM 
Evolution request, or passed on to someone else.

.exit.check: The editor should ensure that the result passes all relevant exit 
criteria, where possible.  [This doesn't usually happen.  GavinM 1997-06-12]

.exit.request: The editor should request that the review leader exits the 
document (see proc.review.exit).
