INTRODUCTION

.scope: This document describes the procedure for exiting a document from 
review.

.readership: This document is intended for anyone acting as review leader.


PROCEDURE

.request: The editor requests the leader to exit the document.

.check: The leader checks that the document passes all relevant exit criteria.  
These should be indicated in review record.
 
.check.fix: If it doesn't pass all exit criteria, but it is possible to fix it, 
he may either fix it himself, or return it to the editor.

.check.fail: If the document cannot be made to pass exit (if, say, there are 
two many estimated defects remaining), it may be passed back to development, 
and reviewed subsequently.  The document remains draft, and the review record 
becomes draft.  The reasons for failure should be documented in the review 
record.

.check.pass: If it passes all criteria, the leader sets the document status to 
"accepted" and the review record to "draft".  The date of exit and any notes 
should be recorded in the review record.  The document is now suitable for 
release as appropriate.

.inform: The leader should inform all review participants and some archived 
mailing list (such as "mm"), of the result of the review, and any notes that 
seem appropriate.
