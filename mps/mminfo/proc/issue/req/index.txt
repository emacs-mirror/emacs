dsm: These are some things I thought of while thinking about support process
(obj.debug-strategy).  I don't care what happens to them.

General Issue Requirements

When an issue is raised

.issue.analyse: determine what improvements are possible.
- determine cause
- determine root cause

.issue.improve: make improvements which help us better meet our requirements.
- fix/patch problem
- make process improvement
- note that our attribute requirements may not force us to fix a bug
that occurs very infrequently -- the bug may be very expensive to fix
and we are within our mean time between failure.  However, not fixing
bugs does not do our image any good.

.issue.record: record information to give feedback.  This helps
us with similar problems in the future (by refering to similar issues
or by process improvement).  It enables us to estimate reliability.
