The Memory Management Information database is mostly formatted in an Apple font 
called Monaco, at nine point size.  Unfortunately, this comes out in Helvetica 
on other systems that do not have Monaco installed.

Attached is a Windows format TrueType font file containing Monaco.  To install 
it, use the Fonts control panel. Notes probably has to be restarted, before it 
will see the new font.

And here it is in PCF format, which hopefully will be of use to X servers.
