<H1>Adaptive Memory Management Group</H1>

<P>The Adaptive Memory Management Group is a part of the DP&amp;P
Business Unit (sic).  It seeks to capitalize on Harlequin's expertise
in the area of memory management and garbage collection and to produce
products for both external and internal markets.</P>

<P>Further information can be obtained from the Memory Management
Information database under Spring
(<TT>PROJECTS/MEMMAN/MMINFO2.NSF</TT> on a server near you) or by <A
HREF="mailto:mm@harlequin.co.uk">mailing the Memory Management
group</A>.</P>


<H2>The Memory Management Reference</H2>

<P>The group maintains <A HREF="http://www.harlequin.com/mm/reference/">The
Memory Management Reference</A> on Harlequin's external web site.  The
latest draft of the next version is available
<A HREF="http://webhost.cam.harlequin.co.uk:83/products/st/mm/">on an
internal server</A>; problems in it should be reported to
<A HREF="mailto:mm-web-team">mm-web-team</A>.</P>


<H2>Useful links</H2>

<P>Most useful links can be found in the
<A HREF="http://www.harlequin.com/mm/reference/links.html">The Memory
Management Reference links page</A>; this is just stuff that didn't
make it there, for one reason or another.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Abstract: This paper presents a classification of barrier
techniques for interleaving tracing with mutator operation during an
incremental garbage collection.  The two useful tricolour invariants
are derived from more elementary considerations of graph traversal.
Barrier techniques for maintaining these invariants are classified
according to the action taken at the barrier (such as scanning an
object or changing its colour), and it is shown that the algorithms
described in the literature cover all the possibilities except one.
Unfortunately, the new technique is impractical.  Ways of combining
barrier techniques are also discussed.</BLOCKQUOTE>
