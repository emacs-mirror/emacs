<H1>Adaptive Memory Management Group</H1>

<P>The Adaptive Memory Management Group is a technology group in the R
&amp; D - Technologies division.  It seeks to capitalize on
Harlequin's expertise in the area of memory management and garbage
collection and produce products for both external and internal
markets.</P>

<P>Further information can be obtained from the Memory Management
Information database under Spring
(<TT>PROJECTS/MEMMAN/MMINFO2.NSF</TT> on a server near you) or by

<P>The group maintains <A HREF="http://www.harlequin.com/mm/reference/">The
Memory Management Reference</A> on Harlequin's external web site.</P>

<H3>Pekka P. Pirinen: Barrier techniques for incremental tracing</H3>

<A HREF="http://webhost.cam.harlequin.co.uk/%7Emm/barrier1.ps">Postscript, 6 pages, 182 KB</A><BR>
<A HREF="http://webhost.cam.harlequin.co.uk/%7Emm/barrier1.pdf">PDF 2.1, 6 pages, 72 dpi, 136 KB</A><BR>
Submitted to <A HREF="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/wilson/ismm98/">The
1998 International Symposium on Memory Management</A> (note that the
version on the web has been slightly edited for clarity and format).

<blockquote>Abstract: This paper presents a classification of barrier
techniques for interleaving tracing with mutator operation during an
incremental garbage collection.  The two useful tricolour invariants
are derived from more elementary considerations of graph traversal.
Barrier techniques for maintaining these invariants are classified
according to the action taken at the barrier (such as scanning an
object or changing its colour), and it is shown that the algorithms
described in the literature cover all the possibilities except one.
Unfortunately, the new technique is impractical.  Ways of combining
barrier techniques are also discussed.</blockquote>
