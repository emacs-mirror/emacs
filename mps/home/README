		   MEMORY MANAGEMENT PROJECT ROBOT


The Memory Management Project Robot is a pseudo-user who performs
tedious tasks on behalf of the project team and report any problems
found.  The crontab file used to perform these automatic actions can
be found in HOMEmm!etc:crontab.

The overnight script checks out a fresh copy of the MM compound,
constructs the project environment, then builds and tests various
products.  For details see the script itself, HOMEmm!etc:overnight.

For information about the Memory Management Project, see the World
Wide Web page MMdoc_WWW!home.html.
