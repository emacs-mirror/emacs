		   MEMORY MANAGEMENT PROJECT ROBOT


The Memory Management Project Robot is a pseudo-user who performs
tedious tasks on behalf of the project team and report any problems
found.  The crontab file used to perform these automatic actions can
be found in HOMEmm!etc:crontab.

For information about the Memory Management Project, see the World
Wide Web page http://springhost.cam.harlequin.co.uk/~mm/home.html
