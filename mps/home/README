		   MEMORY MANAGEMENT ROBOT


$HopeName$

The Memory Management Robot is a pseudo-user who performs tedious
tasks on behalf of the MM group and reports any problems found.  The
crontab files used to perform these automatic actions can be found in
HOMEmm!etc:*.cron.

For information about the Adaptive Memory Management group, see the
web page <URL:http://webhost/~mm/> or the MM Information database in
Spring.
