From variety.hi and variety/he:
|
| .desc: This variety is intended to have as much checking and
| telemetry as possible, but with no significant performance
| overhead as compared to variety.wi.  
|
| .slow: A "significant performance overhead" is a slow-down of
| more than 10% in any typical operation.
|
| .slow.just: The figure 10% was chosen because it is at a level
| that an interactive user would not observe. 
|

To test that varieties hi and he meet these requirements, compare
them with wi by running tests and measuring times. Tests to run:

- client application (Dylan, ScriptWorks &c)
- MMQA_test_function!{77,78,79,80}.c and others

It's not quite clear in the quote above whether "a slow-down of
more than 10%" means a slow down in memory-managament time, or
a slow down in total application time. I take it to refer to a
slow-down in memory-management time, given a typical pattern of
allocation, freeing, &c. Therefore if, say, Dylan goes 5% slower
with variety.hi than variety.wi, I will complain because the
MM takes less than 50% of Dylan's time, so the MM overhead must
be more than 10%.

Test is passed if varieties hi and he are within 10% of performance
of variety.wi.
