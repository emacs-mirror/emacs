Release notes for each release should be in Darwin (in the release
document). They should describe all changes relevant to the users
since the last release shipped to users.

In particular, they should:

 - describe any new functionality introduced
 - explain any changes to the interface, whether to function names,
   arguments, header files needed or whatever.
 - warn of any serious negative changes in performance
