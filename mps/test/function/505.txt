1. Check out a version of SW known to be stable and reliable. It's
best to opt for one which corresponds to an actual external release,
e.g. SW_B11, which is 4.5r1.

2. Build a release version using the new memory manager. Bear in mind
that in this context, "memory manager" means not just the mmsw library,
but the glue code. If the distance between the current SW trunk and the
branch you chose is great enough, you may need to edit the new glue code
to make it compatible with the old SW.

3. Set up device and page settings. Turn on the memory statistics
page feature. Then quit and remove LOGFILE from the SW folder.

4. Start SW, run tests, quit.

5. Look at 

If time permits, try on a range of platforms with a range of ScriptWorks
settings. See other SW tests for suggestions.
