 summary = MM works with Dylan debugger
 language = english
END_HEADER

1. Get a recent, stable release of Dylan. If you're not sure what release would
be appropriate, ask Tony.

2. Create a version of hqn-dylan.dll that uses the memory manager to be tested.
Do this by compiling the dylan library, then copying the mmdw.lib you want to
the dylan\lib directory, then from the dylan\build\dylan directory run
"build microsoft force dll".

3. Run the following tests, making sure the new hqn-dylan is used for the
debugger and the debuggee.

console-debug dylan-compile
profile at 50
c
--> compile-library -force-compile dylan
STOP
profile results   [check that MM functions appear correctly in the profile]
break AMCFix
c
(breakpoint hit)
bt 20             [check that MM functions appear correctly on the stack]
quit

The test is passed if MM functions are correctly understood by the debugger
and there are no other problems.
