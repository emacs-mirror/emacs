$HopeName: MMQA_harness!README(trunk.8) $

This is the Memory Management QA test harness. To use it you need
perl 5 (or higher). Go "perl qa help" for help, "perl qa options"
to see what version of the harness you have (or look at the
file "test/version").

Some brief instructions are in guide.mm-qa in MM Information; ask
<rit> (ext 3822) if you need help, want to complain, &c.
