compile test libraries
% $Id$

Usage: qa clib [<options>]

'clib' recompiles the test libraries (as listed in testlib:manifest)
This should be done before running tests with 'run'. The harness
will check whether the test libraries are up-to-date when running
tests, and give an error if not.

Compiled libraries are placed in the obj:<platform>: directory.

In addition to compiling the libraries, 'clib' looks at the mps header
files and the specified link objects, to determine what mps interfaces
are available. This information is recorded in the file 'mmqasym.h'.
