run tests, reporting results and verdict
% $Id$

Usage: qa run [<options>] <testfile> [<testfile> ...]

'run' runs tests individually. The test libraries should previously
have been compiled with 'clib'; if the harness believes the test
libraries may not be up-to-date, it will give an error and ask
you to run 'clib' first. (You can force the harness to run a test
with potentially out-of-date libraries by specifying the "-danger"
option to 'run'. This is not recommended.)

'run' shows the test's output as it runs, then when it finishes,
displays test information, results, and the verdict: PASS or FAIL.
