run tests from test-sets
% $Id$

Usage: qa runset [<options>] <testsetfile> [<testsetfile> ...]

'runset' compiles the test libraries and then runs all the
tests in the test-sets.

A test-set is a file containing a list of tests, one test
per line. Blank lines or those beginning with % are ignored.
Tests can be specified as absolute files, or relative to the
current directory.

'runset' runs all the tests, and saves three log files in the
logs directory (see 'qa help options'):

 summ.log -- summary log: one line per test, PASS or FAIL
 res.log  -- results log: test specifications, results and verdict
 full.log -- full log: specifications, results, verdict and transcript

To run tests individually, use the 'run' command.
