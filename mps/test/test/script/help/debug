debug a test
% $Id$

Usage: qa debug [<options>] <testfile>

'debug' launches a test in the debugger. The test libraries should
previously have been compiled with 'clib'; if the harness believes the
test libraries may not be up-to-date, it will give an error and ask
you to run 'clib' first. (You can force the harness to run a test with
potentially out-of-date libraries by specifying the "-danger" option
to 'debug'. This is not recommended.)
