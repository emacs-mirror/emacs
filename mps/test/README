This is the Memory Management QA test harness. To use it you need Perl
5 (or higher).


Quick start
-----------

In a shell in the test directory::

    perl test/qa clib
    perl test/qa run function/5.c
    perl test/qa runset testsets/passing


Usage and options
-----------------

Run ``perl test/qa help`` for help; run ``perl test/qa options`` to
see what version of the harness you have (or look at the file
``test/version``) and which options are available.

The most important options are the ``-p`` option which specifies the
platform (for example, ``-p lii6ll``) if the auto-detected platform is
not the one you want to test, and the ``-v`` option which specifies
the variety (for example ``-v hot``) if the cool variety is not the
one you want to test.


Debugging on Unix
-----------------

Each test case is compiled in its turn to the file
``test/obj/$PLATFORM/tmp_test`` so you can debug it with::

    gdb test/obj/lii6gc/tmp_test

Or ``lldb`` instead of ``gdb``. MMQA sets its own assertion handler,
so you'll probably want to set a breakpoint on ``mmqa_assert_handler``.


Testing on Windows
------------------

In a Cygwin shell, from the test directory::

    export LANG=C # avoid locale warnings from Perl.
    perl test/qa clib
    perl test/qa run function/5.c
    perl test/qa runset testsets/passing

The runset command can result in this error::

    LINK : fatal error LNK1168: cannot open test/obj/nt_AMD64__pc/tmp_test.exe for writing

You may be able to avoid this by running "View Local Services" from
the Windows Control Panel, double-clicking the "Application
Experience" service, and switching "Startup type" to "Automatic". See
the documentation for LNK1168_.

At present, the easiest way to debug a test case is to edit
test/test/script/platform and set::

    $comwrap = "vsjitdebugger \"";
