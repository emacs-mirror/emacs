This is the Memory Management QA test harness. To use it you need
perl 5 (or higher). Go "perl qa help" for help, "perl qa options"
to see what version of the harness you have (or look at the
file "test/version").


Testing on unix
---------------

From the test directory::

    PLATFORM=lii6ll # substitute your platform
    CODE=../code # code directory of the branch you are testing
    make -C $CODE -f $PLATFORM.gmk VARIETY=cool $PLATFORM/cool/mps.o
    alias qa="perl test/qa -i $CODE -l $CODE/$PLATFORM/cool/mps.o"
    qa clib
    qa run function/5.c
    qa runset testsets/passing

Each test case is compiled in its turn to the file
``test/obj/$(uname -s)_$(uname -r)_$(uname -p)__unix/tmp_test``
so you can debug it with::

    lldb test/obj/$(uname -s)_$(uname -r)_$(uname -p)__unix/tmp_test

Or ``gdb`` instead of ``lldb``. MMQA sets its own assertion handler,
so you'll probaly want to set a breakpoint on mmqa_assert_handler.
