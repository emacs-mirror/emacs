This is the Memory Management QA test harness. To use it you need
perl 5 (or higher). Go "perl qa help" for help, "perl qa options"
to see what version of the harness you have (or look at the
file "test/version").


Testing on unix
---------------

From the root of the master sources or development branch::

    $ PLATFORM=lii6ll # substitute your platform
    $ make -C code -f $PLATFORM.gmk VARIETY=cool $PLATFORM/cool/mps.o
    $ alias qa="perl test/test/qa -i code -l code/$PLATFORM/cool/mps.o"
    $ qa clib
    $ qa run test/function/5.c
    $ qa runset test/testsets/passing

Each test case is compiled in its turn to the file
``test/test/obj/$(uname -s)_$(uname -r)_$(uname -p)__unix/tmp_test``
so you can debug it with::

    $ lldb test/test/obj/$(uname -s)_$(uname -r)_$(uname -p)__unix/tmp_test

(Or ``gdb`` instead of ``lldb``.)
