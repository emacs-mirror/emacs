This is the Memory Management QA test harness. To use it you need
perl 5 (or higher). Go "perl qa help" for help, "perl qa options"
to see what version of the harness you have (or look at the
file "test/version").


Running on OS X
---------------

On OS X you can invoke the test suite like this (from the root of the
master sources or development branch)::

    $ ./configure && make
    $ alias qa="perl test/test/qa -i code -l code/xc/mps.build/Debug/mps.build/Objects-normal/x86_64/mps.o"
    $ qa clib
    $ qa run test/function/5.c
    $ qa runset test/testsets/passing

Each test case is compiled in its turn to the file
``test/test/obj/Darwin_12.3.0_i386__unix/tmp_test`` so you can debug it
with::

    $ lldb test/test/obj/Darwin_12.3.0_i386__unix/tmp_test
