;;; Commentary:
;;
;; Modus Operandi is the light variant of the Modus themes (Modus
;; Vivendi is the dark one).  The themes are designed for color-contrast
;; accessibility.  More specifically:
;;
;;     1. Provide a consistent minimum contrast ratio between background
;;     and foreground values of 7:1 or higher.  This meets the highest
;;     such accessibility criterion per the guidelines of the Worldwide
;;     Web Consortium's Working Group on Accessibility (WCAG AAA
;;     standard).
;;
;;     2. Offer as close to full face coverage as possible.  The list is
;;     already quite long, with more additions to follow as part of the
;;     ongoing development process.
;;
;; For a complete view of the project, also refer to the following files
;; (should be distributed in the same repository/directory as the
;; current item):

;; - modus-themes.el            (Main code shared between the themes)
;; - modus-vivendi-theme.el     (Dark theme)
