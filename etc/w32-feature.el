;;; Commentary:

;; This file provides tests for various features of Emacs. It is
;; designed to check whether bundled binary distributions of Emacs on
;; windows are fully functional.

;; By default is checks whether the features that we are expect to be
;; available on Emacs for Windows are reported to be available. It
;; should be possible to run these tests from a distributed version of
;; Emacs.

;; In addition, it provides a single command
;; `w32-feature-load-tests'. If the full source repository of Emacs is
;; available, this will load selected files from the repository which
;; test these features.
