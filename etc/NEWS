* Installation Changes in Emacs 29.1

+++
** Emacs can be built with built-in support for accessing SQLite databases.
This uses the popular sqlite3 library, and can be disabled by using
the '--without-sqlite3' option to the 'configure' script.

+++
** Support for the WebP image format.
This support is built by default when the libwebp library is
available, and includes support for animated WebP images.  To disable
WebP support, use the '--without-webp' configure flag.  Image
specifiers can now use ':type webp'.

+++
** Emacs has been ported to the Haiku operating system.
The configuration process should automatically detect and build for
Haiku.  There is also an optional window-system port to Haiku, which
can be enabled by configuring Emacs with the option '--with-be-app',
which will require the Haiku Application Kit development headers and a
C++ compiler to be present on your system.  If Emacs is not built with
the option '--with-be-app', the resulting Emacs will only run in
text-mode terminals.

To enable Cairo support, ensure that the Cairo and FreeType
development files are present on your system, and configure Emacs with
'--with-be-cairo'.

Unlike X, there is no compile-time option to enable or disable
double-buffering; it is always enabled.  To disable it, change the
frame parameter 'inhibit-double-buffering' instead.

---
** Emacs now installs the ".pdmp" file using a unique fingerprint in the name.
The file is typically installed using a file name akin to
"...dir/libexec/emacs/29.1/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/emacs-<fingerprint>.pdmp".
If a constant file name is required, the file can be renamed to
"emacs.pdmp", and Emacs will find it during startup anyway.

---
** Emacs now uses XInput 2 for input events.
If your X server has support and you have the XInput 2 development
headers installed, Emacs will use the X Input Extension for handling
input.  If this causes problems, you can configure Emacs with the
option '--without-xinput2' to disable this support.

'(featurep 'xinput2)' can be used to test for the presence of XInput 2
support from Lisp programs.

---
** Emacs no longer reduces the size of the Japanese dictionary.
Building Emacs includes generation of a Japanese dictionary, which is
used by Japanese input methods.  Previously, the build included a step
of reducing the size of this dictionary's vocabulary.  This vocabulary
reduction is now optional, by default off.  If you need the Emacs
build to include the vocabulary reduction, configure Emacs with the
option '--with-small-ja-dic'.  In an Emacs source tree already
configured without that option, you can force the vocabulary reduction
by saying

    make -C leim generate-ja-dic JA_DIC_NO_REDUCTION_OPTION=''

after deleting "lisp/leim/ja-dic/ja-dic.el".

+++
** Emacs now supports being built with pure GTK.
To use this option, make sure the GTK 3 (version 3.22.23 or later) and
Cairo development files are installed, and configure Emacs with the
option '--with-pgtk'.  Unlike the default X and GTK build, the
resulting Emacs binary will work on any underlying window system
supported by GDK, such as Wayland and Broadway.  We do not recommend
that you use this configuration, unless you are running a window
system that's supported by GDK other than X.  Running this
configuration on X is known to have problems, such as undesirable
frame positioning and various issues with keyboard input of sequences
such as 'C-;' and 'C-S-u'.

---
** The docstrings of preloaded files are not in "etc/DOC" any more.
Instead, they're fetched as needed from the corresponding ".elc" file,
as was already the case for all the non-preloaded files.

** Emacs Sessions (Desktop)

+++
*** New option to load a locked desktop if locking Emacs is not running.
The option 'desktop-load-locked-desktop' can now be set to the value
'check-pid', which means to allow loading a locked ".emacs.desktop"
file if the Emacs process which locked it is no longer running on the
local machine.  This allows avoiding questions about locked desktop
files when the Emacs session which locked it crashes, or was otherwise
interrupted, and didn't exit gracefully.  See the "(emacs) Saving
Emacs Sessions" node in the Emacs manual for more details.

** Miscellaneous

+++
*** User option 'minibuffer-eldef-shorten-default' is now obsolete.
Customize the user option 'minibuffer-default-prompt-format' instead.


* Startup Changes in Emacs 29.1

+++
** '--batch' and '--script' now adjust the garbage collection levels.
These switches now set 'gc-cons-percentage' to 1.0 (up from the
default of 0.1).  This means that batch processes will typically use
more memory than before, but use less time doing garbage collection.
Batch jobs that are supposed to run for a long time should adjust the
limit back down again.

+++
** Emacs can now be used more easily in an executable script.
If you start an executable script with

    #!/usr/bin/emacs -x

Emacs will start without reading any init files (like with '--quick'),
and then execute the rest of the script file as Emacs Lisp.  When it
reaches the end of the script, Emacs will exit with an exit code from
the value of the final form.

+++
** Emacs now supports setting 'user-emacs-directory' via '--init-directory'.

+++
** Emacs now has a '--fingerprint' option.
This will output a string identifying the current Emacs build.

+++
** New hook 'after-pdump-load-hook'.
This is run at the end of the Emacs startup process, and is meant to
be used to reinitialize structures that would normally be done at load
time.

** Native Compilation

---
*** New command 'native-compile-prune-cache'.
This command deletes older ".eln" cache entries (but not the ones for
the current Emacs version).

---
*** New function 'startup-redirect-eln-cache'.
This function can be called in your init files to change the
user-specific directory where Emacs stores the "*.eln" files produced
by native compilation of Lisp packages Emacs loads.  The default
eln-cache directory is unchanged: it is the "eln-cache" subdirectory
of 'user-emacs-directory'.


* Incompatible changes in Emacs 29.1

---
*** 'show-paren-mode' is now disabled in 'special-mode' buffers.
In Emacs versions previous to Emacs 28.1, 'show-paren-mode' defaulted
off.  In Emacs 28.1, the mode was switched on in all buffers.  In
Emacs 29.1, this was changed to be switched on in all editing-related
buffers, but not in buffers that inherit from 'special-mode'.  To get
back to how things worked in Emacs 28.1, put the following in your
init file:

  (setopt show-paren-predicate t)

+++
*** Explicitly-set read-only state is preserved when reverting a buffer.
If you use the 'C-x C-q' command to change the read-only state of the
buffer and then revert it, Emacs would previously use the file
permission bits to determine whether the buffer should be read-only
after reverting the buffer.  Emacs now remembers the decision made in
'C-x C-q'.

---
*** The Gtk selection face is no longer used for the region.
The combination of a Gtk-controlled background and a foreground color
controlled by the internal Emacs machinery led to low-contrast faces
in common default setups.  Emacs now uses the same 'region' face on
Gtk and non-Gtk setups.

** Dired

---
*** 'w' ('dired-copy-filename-as-kill') has changed behavior.
If there are several files marked, file names containing space and
quote characters will be quoted "like this".

---
*** The 'd' command now more consistently skips dot files.
In previous Emacs versions, commands like 'C-u 10 d' would put the "D"
mark on the next ten files, no matter whether they were dot files
(i.e., "." and "..") or not, while marking the next ten lines with the
mouse (in 'transient-mark-mode') and then hitting 'd' would skip dot
files.  These now work equivalently.

+++
** Warning about "eager macro-expansion failure" is changed into an error.

---
** Previously, the X "reverseVideo" value at startup was heeded for all frames.
This meant that if you had a "reverseVideo" resource on the initial
display, and then opened up a new frame on a display without any
explicit "reverseVideo" setting, it would get heeded there, too.  (This
included terminal frames.)  In Emacs 29, the "reverseVideo" X resource
is handled like all the other X resources, and set on a per-frame basis.

+++
** 'E' in 'query-replace' now edits the replacement with exact case.
Previously, this command did the same as 'e'.

---
** '/ a' in "*Packages*" buffer now limits by archive name(s) instead of regexp.

+++
** Setting the goal columns now also affects '<prior>' and '<next>'.
Previously, 'C-x C-n' only affected 'next-line' and 'previous-line',
but it now also affects 'scroll-up-command' and 'scroll-down-command'.

---
** Isearch in "*Help*" and "*info*" now char-folds quote characters by default.
This means that you can say 'C-s `foo' (GRAVE ACCENT) if the buffer
contains "‘foo" (LEFT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK) and the like.  These
quotation characters look somewhat similar in some fonts.  To switch
this off, disable the new 'isearch-fold-quotes-mode' minor mode.

---
** Sorting commands no longer necessarily change modification status.
In earlier Emacs versions, commands like 'M-x sort-lines' would always
change buffer modification status to "modified", whether they changed
something in the buffer or not.  This has been changed: The buffer is
marked as modified only if the sorting ended up changing the contents
of the buffer.

---
** 'string-lines' handles trailing newlines differently.
It no longer returns an empty final string if the string ends with a
newline.

---
** 'TAB' and '<backtab>' are now bound in 'button-map'.
This means that if point is on a button, 'TAB' will take you to the
next button, even if the mode has bound it to something else.  This
also means that 'TAB' on a button in an 'outline-minor-mode' heading
will move point instead of collapsing the outline.

---
** 'Info-default-directory-list' is no longer populated at Emacs startup.
If you have code in your init file that removes directories from
'Info-default-directory-list', this will no longer work.

---
** 'C-k' no longer deletes files in 'ido-mode'.
To get the previous action back, put something like the following in
your Init file:

    (require 'ido)
    (keymap-set ido-file-completion-map "C-k" #'ido-delete-file-at-head)

---
** New user option 'term-clear-full-screen-programs'.
By default, term will now work like most terminals when displaying
full-screen programs: When they exit, the output is cleared, leaving
what was displayed in the window before the programs started.  Set
this user option to nil to revert back to the old behavior.

---
** Support for old EIEIO functions is not autoloaded any more.
You need an explicit '(require 'eieio-compat)' to use 'defmethod'
and 'defgeneric' (which have been made obsolete in Emacs 25.1 with
'cl-defmethod' and 'cl-defgeneric').
Similarly you might need to '(require 'eieio-compat)' before loading
files that were compiled with an old EIEIO (Emacs<25).

---
** 'C-x 8 .' has been moved to 'C-x 8 . .'.
This is to open up the 'C-x 8 .' map to bind further characters there.

---
** 'C-x 8 =' moved to 'C-x 8 = ='.
You can now use 'C-x 8 =' to insert several characters with macron;
for example, 'C-x 8 = a' will insert U+0101 LATIN SMALL LETTER A WITH
MACRON.  To insert a lone macron, type 'C-x 8 = =' instead of the
previous 'C-x ='.

** Eshell

---
*** 'source' and '.' no longer accept the '--help' option.
This is for compatibility with the shell versions of these commands,
which don't handle options like '--help' in any special way.

+++
*** String delimiters in argument predicates/modifiers are more restricted.
Previously, some argument predicates/modifiers allowed arbitrary
characters as string delimiters.  To provide more unified behavior
across all predicates/modifiers, the list of allowed delimiters has
been restricted to "...", '...', /.../, |...|, (...), [...], <...>,
and {...}.  See the "(eshell) Argument Predication and Modification"
node in the Eshell manual for more details.

+++
*** Eshell pipelines now only pipe stdout by default.
To pipe both stdout and stderr, use the '|&' operator instead of '|'.

---
** The 'delete-forward-char' command now deletes by grapheme clusters.
This command is by default bound to the <Delete> function key
(a.k.a. <deletechar>).  When invoked without a prefix argument or with
a positive prefix numeric argument, the command will now delete
complete grapheme clusters produced by character composition.  For
example, if point is before an Emoji sequence, pressing <Delete> will
delete the entire sequence, not just a single character at its
beginning.

+++
** 'load-history' does not treat autoloads specially any more.
An autoload definition appears just as a '(defun . NAME)' and the
'(t . NAME)' entries are not generated any more.

---
** The Tamil input methods no longer insert Tamil digits.
The input methods 'tamil-itrans' and 'tamil-inscript' no longer insert
the Tamil digits, as those digit characters are not used nowadays by
speakers of the Tamil language.  To get back the previous behavior,
use the new 'tamil-itrans-digits' and 'tamil-inscript-digits' input
methods instead.

+++
** New variable 'current-time-list' governing default timestamp form.
Functions like 'current-time' now yield '(TICKS . HZ)' timestamps if
this new variable is nil.  The variable defaults to t, which means
these functions default to timestamps of the forms '(HI LO US PS)',
'(HI LO US)' or '(HI LO)', which are less regular and less efficient.
This is part of a long-planned change first documented in Emacs 27.
Developers are encouraged to test timestamp-related code with this
variable set to nil, as it will default to nil in a future Emacs
version and will be removed some time after that.

+++
** Functions that recreate the "*scratch*" buffer now also initialize it.
When functions like 'other-buffer' and 'server-execute' recreate
"*scratch*", they now also insert 'initial-scratch-message' and set
the major mode according to 'initial-major-mode', like at Emacs
startup.  Previously, these functions ignored
'initial-scratch-message' and left "*scratch*" in 'fundamental-mode'.

---
** The 'rlogin' method in the URL library is now obsolete.
Emacs will now display a warning if you request a URL like
"rlogin://foo@example.org".

---
** Setting 'url-gateway-method' to 'rlogin' is now obsolete.
Emacs will now display a warning when setting it to that value.
The user options 'url-gateway-rlogin-host',
'url-gateway-rlogin-parameters', and 'url-gateway-rlogin-user-name'
are also obsolete.

---
** The autoarg.el library is now marked obsolete.
This library provides the 'autoarg-mode' and 'autoarg-kp-mode' minor
modes to emulate the behavior of the historical editor Twenex Emacs.
It is believed to no longer be useful.

---
** The quickurl.el library is now obsolete.
Use 'abbrev', 'skeleton' or 'tempo' instead.

---
** The rlogin.el library, and the 'rsh' command are now obsolete.
Use something like 'M-x shell RET ssh <host> RET' instead.

---
** The url-about.el library is now obsolete.

---
** The autoload.el library is now obsolete.
It is superseded by the loaddefs-gen.el library.

---
** The netrc.el library is now obsolete.
Use the 'auth-source-netrc-parse-all' function in auth-source.el
instead.

---
** The url-dired.el library is now obsolete.

---
** The fast-lock.el and lazy-lock.el library have been removed.
They have been obsolete since Emacs 22.1.

The variable 'font-lock-support-mode' is occasionally useful for
debugging purposes.  It is now a regular variable (instead of a user
option) and can be set to nil to disable Just-in-time Lock mode.


* Changes in Emacs 29.1

---
** New user option 'electric-quote-replace-consecutive'.

---
** Emacs is now capable of editing files with very long lines.
The display of long lines has been optimized, and Emacs should no
longer choke when a buffer on display contains long lines.  The
variable 'long-line-threshold' controls whether and when these display
optimizations are in effect.

A companion variable 'large-hscroll-threshold' controls when another
set of display optimizations are in effect, which are aimed
specifically at speeding up display of long lines that are truncated.

If you still experience slowdowns while editing files with long lines,
this may be due to line truncation, or to one of the enabled minor
modes, or to the current major mode.  Try turning off line truncation
with 'C-x x t', or try disabling all known slow minor modes with
'M-x so-long-minor-mode', or try disabling both known slow minor modes
and the major mode with 'M-x so-long-mode', or visit the file with
'M-x find-file-literally' instead of the usual 'C-x C-f'.

Note that the display optimizations in these cases may cause the
buffer to be occasionally mis-fontified.

The new function 'long-line-optimizations-p' returns non-nil when
these optimizations are in effect in the current buffer.

+++
** New command to change the font size globally.
To increase the font size, type 'C-x C-M-+' or 'C-x C-M-='; to
decrease it, type 'C-x C-M--'; to restore the font size, type 'C-x
C-M-0'.  The final key in these commands may be repeated without the
leading 'C-x' and without the modifiers, e.g. 'C-x C-M-+ C-M-+ C-M-+'
and 'C-x C-M-+ + +' increase the font size by three steps.  When
'mouse-wheel-mode' is enabled, 'C-M-wheel-up' and 'C-M-wheel-down' also
increase and decrease the font size globally.  Additionally, the
user option 'global-text-scale-adjust-resizes-frames' controls whether
the frames are resized when the font size is changed.

+++
** New function 'file-parent-directory'.
Get the parent directory of a file.

** New config variable 'syntax-wholeline-max' to reduce the cost of long lines.
This variable is used by some operations (mostly syntax-propertization
and font-locking) to treat lines longer than this variable as if they
were made up of various smaller lines.  This can help reduce the
slowdowns seen in buffers made of a single long line, but can also
cause misbehavior in the presence of such long lines (tho most of that
misbehavior should usually be limited to mis-highlighting).  You can
recover the previous behavior with:

    (setq syntax-wholeline-max most-positive-fixnum)

---
** New bindings in 'find-function-setup-keys' for 'find-library'.
When 'find-function-setup-keys' is enabled, 'C-x L' is now bound to
'find-library', 'C-x 4 L' is now bound to 'find-library-other-window'
and 'C-x 5 L' is now bound to 'find-library-other-frame'.

+++
** New key binding after 'M-x' or 'M-X': 'M-X'.
Emacs allows different completion predicates to be used with 'M-x'
(i.e., 'execute-extended-command') via the
'read-extended-command-predicate' user option.  Emacs also has the
'M-X' (note upper case) command, which only displays commands
especially relevant to the current buffer.  Emacs now allows toggling
between these modes while the user is inputting a command by hitting
'M-X' while in the minibuffer.

---
** Interactively, 'kill-buffer' will now offer to save the buffer if unsaved.

---
** New commands 'duplicate-line' and 'duplicate-dwim'.
'duplicate-line' duplicates the current line the specified number of times.
'duplicate-dwim' duplicates the region if it is active.  If not, it
works like 'duplicate-line'.  An active rectangular region is
duplicated on its right-hand side.

---
** Files with the ".eld" extension are now visited in 'lisp-data-mode'.

+++
** 'network-lookup-address-info' can now check numeric IP address validity.
Specifying 'numeric' as the new optional 'hints' argument makes it
check if the passed address is a valid IPv4/IPv6 address (without DNS
traffic).

    (network-lookup-address-info "127.1" 'ipv4 'numeric)
    => ([127 0 0 1 0])

+++
** New command 'find-sibling-file'.
This command jumps to a file considered a "sibling file", which is
determined according to the new user option 'find-sibling-rules'.

+++
** New user option 'delete-selection-temporary-region'.
When non-nil, 'delete-selection-mode' will only delete the temporary
regions (usually set by mouse-dragging or shift-selection).

+++
** New user option 'switch-to-prev-buffer-skip-regexp'.
This should be a regexp or a list of regexps; buffers whose names
match those regexps will be ignored by 'switch-to-prev-buffer' and
'switch-to-next-buffer'.

+++
** New command 'rename-visited-file'.
This command renames the file visited by the current buffer by moving
it to a new location, and also makes the buffer visit this new file.

** Menus

---
*** The entries following the buffers in the "Buffers" menu can now be altered.
Change the 'menu-bar-buffers-menu-command-entries' variable to alter
the entries that follow the buffer list.

---
** 'delete-process' is now a command.
When called interactively, it will kill the process running in the
current buffer (if any).  This can be useful if you have runaway
output in the current buffer (from a process or a network connection),
and want to stop it.

+++
** New command 'restart-emacs'.
This is like 'save-buffers-kill-emacs', but instead of just killing
the current Emacs process at the end, it starts a new Emacs process
(using the same command line arguments as the running Emacs process).
'kill-emacs' and 'save-buffers-kill-emacs' have also gained new
optional parameters to restart instead of just killing the current
process.

+++
** New user option 'mouse-drag-mode-line-buffer'.
If non-nil, dragging on the buffer name part of the mode-line will
drag the buffer's associated file to other programs.  This option is
currently only available on X, Haiku and Nextstep (GNUstep or macOS).

+++
** New user option 'mouse-drag-and-drop-region-cross-program'.
If non-nil, this option allows dragging text in the region from Emacs
to another program.

---
** New user option 'mouse-drag-and-drop-region-scroll-margin'.
If non-nil, this option allows scrolling a window while dragging text
around without a scroll wheel.

+++
*** 'mouse-drag-copy-region' can now be 'non-empty'.
This inhibits putting empty strings onto the kill ring.

+++
** New user options 'dnd-indicate-insertion-point' and 'dnd-scroll-margin'.
These options allow adjusting point and scrolling a window when
dragging items from another program.

+++
** The X Direct Save (XDS) protocol is now supported.
This means dropping an image or file link from programs such as
Firefox will no longer create a temporary file in a random directory,
instead asking you where to save the file first.

+++
** New user option 'record-all-keys'.
If non-nil, this option will force recording of all input keys,
including those typed in response to passwords prompt (this was the
previous behavior).  The default is nil, which inhibits recording of
passwords.

+++
** New function 'command-query'.
This function makes its argument command prompt the user for
confirmation before executing.

+++
** The 'disabled' property of a command's symbol can now be a list.
The first element of the list should be the symbol 'query', which will
cause the command disabled this way prompt the user with a y/n or a
yes/no question before executing.  The new function 'command-query' is
a convenient method of making commands disabled in this way.

---
** 'count-lines' will now report buffer totals if given a prefix.

+++
** 'count-words' will now report sentence count when used interactively.

---
** New user option 'find-library-include-other-files'.
If set to nil, commands like 'find-library' will only include library
files in the completion candidates.  The default is t, which preserves
previous behavior, whereby non-library files could also be included.

+++
** New command 'sqlite-mode-open-file' for examining an sqlite3 file.
This uses the new 'sqlite-mode' which allows listing the tables in a
DB file, and examining and modifying the columns and the contents of
those tables.

---
** 'write-file' will now copy some file mode bits.
If the current buffer is visiting a file that is executable, the
'C-x C-w' command will now make the new file executable, too.

+++
** New user option 'process-error-pause-time'.
This determines how long to pause Emacs after a process
filter/sentinel error has been handled.

+++
** New face 'variable-pitch-text'.
This face is like 'variable-pitch' (from which it inherits), but is
slightly larger, which should help with the visual size differences
between the default, non-proportional font and proportional fonts when
mixed.

+++
** New face 'mode-line-active'.
This inherits from the 'mode-line' face, but is the face actually used
on the mode lines (along with 'mode-line-inactive').

+++
** New face attribute pseudo-value 'reset'.
This value stands for the value of the corresponding attribute of the
'default' face.  It can be used to reset attribute values produced by
inheriting from other faces.

+++
** New function 'buffer-text-pixel-size'.
This is similar to 'window-text-pixel-size', but can be used when the
buffer isn't displayed.

+++
** New X resource: "borderThickness".
This controls the thickness of the external borders of the menu bars
and pop-up menus.

+++
** New X resource: "inputStyle".
This controls the style of the pre-edit and status areas of X input
methods.

+++
** New X resources: "highlightForeground" and "highlightBackground".
Only in the Lucid build, this controls colors used for highlighted
menu item widgets.

+++
** On X, Emacs now tries to synchronize window resize with the window manager.
This leads to less flicker and empty areas of a frame being displayed
when a frame is being resized.  Unfortunately, it does not work on
some ancient buggy window managers, so if Emacs appears to freeze, but
is still responsive to input, you can turn it off by setting the X
resource "synchronizeResize" to "off".

+++
** On X, Emacs can optionally synchronize display with the graphics hardware.
When this is enabled by setting the X resource "synchronizeResize" to
"extended", frame content "tearing" is drastically reduced.  This is
only supported on the Motif, Lucid, and no-toolkit builds, and
requires an X compositing manager supporting the extended frame
synchronization protocol (see
https://fishsoup.net/misc/wm-spec-synchronization.html).

This behavior can be toggled on and off via the frame parameter
'use-frame-synchronization'.

+++
** New frame parameter 'alpha-background' and X resource "alphaBackground".
This controls the opacity of the text background when running on a
composited display.

+++
** New frame parameter 'shaded'.
With window managers which support this, it controls whether or not a
frame's contents will be hidden, leaving only the title bar on display.

---
** New user option 'x-gtk-use-native-input'.
This controls whether or not GTK input methods are used by Emacs,
instead of XIM input methods.

+++
** New user option 'use-system-tooltips'.
This controls whether to use the toolkit tooltips, or Emacs's own
native implementation of tooltips as small frames.  This option is
only meaningful if Emacs was built with GTK+, Nextstep, or Haiku
support, and defaults to t, which makes Emacs use the toolkit
tooltips.  The existing GTK-specific option
'x-gtk-use-system-tooltips' is now an alias of this new option.

+++
** Non-native tooltips are now supported on Nextstep.
This means Emacs built with GNUstep or built on macOS is now able to
display different faces and images inside tooltips when the
'use-system-tooltips' user option is nil.

** Connection-local variables

+++
*** Some connection-local variables are now user options.
The variables 'connection-local-profile-alist' and
'connection-local-criteria-alist' are now user options, in order to
make it more convenient to inspect and modify them.

+++
*** The default connection-local application can be changed temporarily.
Running 'with-connection-local-variables' defaults to application
'tramp'.  This can be changed by let-binding
'connection-local-default-application' to another symbol.  This is
useful when running code in a buffer where Tramp has already set some
connection-local variables.

---
** New minor mode 'pixel-scroll-precision-mode'.
When enabled, and if your mouse supports it, you can scroll the
display up or down at pixel resolution, according to what your mouse
wheel reports.  Unlike 'pixel-scroll-mode', this mode scrolls the
display pixel-by-pixel, as opposed to only animating line-by-line
scrolls.

** Terminal Emacs

---
*** Emacs will now use 24-bit colors on terminals that support "Tc" capability.
This is in addition to previously-supported ways of discovering 24-bit
color support: either via the "RGB" or "setf24" capabilities, or if
the 'COLORTERM' environment variable is set to the value "truecolor".

*** Select active regions with xterm selection support.
On terminals with xterm setSelection support, the active region may be
saved to the X primary selection, following the
'select-active-regions' variable.  This support is enabled when
'tty-select-active-regions' is non-nil.

---
*** New command to set up display of unsupported characters.
The new command 'standard-display-by-replacement-char' produces Lisp
code that sets up the 'standard-display-table' to use a replacement
character for display of characters that the text-mode terminal
doesn't support.  It is most useful with the Linux console and similar
terminals, where Emacs has a reliable way of determining which
characters have glyphs in the font loaded into the terminal's memory.

** ERT

+++
*** New ERT variables 'ert-batch-print-length' and 'ert-batch-print-level'.
These variables will override 'print-length' and 'print-level' when
printing Lisp values in ERT batch test results.

---
*** Redefining an ERT test in batch mode now signals an error.
Executing 'ert-deftest' with the same name as an existing test causes
the previous definition to be discarded, which was probably not
intended when this occurs in batch mode.  To remedy the error, rename
tests so that they all have unique names.

+++
*** ERT can generate JUnit test reports.
When environment variable 'EMACS_TEST_JUNIT_REPORT' is set, ERT
generates a JUnit test report under this file name.  This is useful
for Emacs integration into CI/CD test environments.

---
*** Unbound test symbols now signal an 'ert-test-unbound' error.
This affects the 'ert-select-tests' function and its callers.

** Emoji

+++
*** Emacs now has several new methods for inserting Emojis.
The Emoji commands are under the new 'C-x 8 e' prefix.

+++
*** New command 'emoji-insert' (bound to 'C-x 8 e e' and 'C-x 8 e i').
This command guides you through various Emoji categories and
combinations in a graphical menu system.

+++
*** New command 'emoji-search' (bound to 'C-x 8 e s').
This command lets you search for Emojis based on names.

+++
*** New command 'emoji-list' (bound to 'C-x 8 e l').
This command lists all Emojis (categorized by themes) in a special
buffer and lets you choose one of them.

---
*** New command 'emoji-recent' (bound to 'C-x 8 e r').
This command lets you choose among the Emojis you have recently
inserted.

+++
*** New command 'emoji-describe' (bound to 'C-x 8 e d').
This command will tell you the name of the Emoji at point.  (This
command also works for non-Emoji characters.)

---
*** New commands 'emoji-zoom-increase' and 'emoji-zoom-decrease'.
These are bound to 'C-x 8 e +' and 'C-x 8 e -', respectively.  They
can be used on any character, but are mainly useful for emoji.

---
*** New input method 'emoji'.
This allows you to enter emoji using short strings, eg ':face_palm:'
or ':scream:'.

** Help

---
*** Variable values displayed by 'C-h v' in "*Help*" are now font-locked.

+++
*** New user option 'help-clean-buttons'.
If non-nil, link buttons in "*Help*" will have any surrounding quotes
removed.

---
*** 'M-x apropos-variable' output now includes values of variables.

+++
*** New docstring syntax to indicate that symbols shouldn't be links.
When displaying docstrings in "*Help*" buffers, strings that are
"`like-this'" are made into links (if they point to a bound
function/variable).  This can lead to false positives when talking
about values that are symbols that happen to have the same names as
functions/variables.  To inhibit this buttonification, the new
"\\+`like-this'" syntax can be used.

+++
*** New user option 'help-window-keep-selected'.
If non-nil, commands to show the info manual and the source will reuse
the same window the "*Help*" buffer is shown in.

---
*** Commands like 'C-h f' have changed how they describe menu bindings.
For instance, previously a command might be described as having the
following bindings:

    It is bound to <open>, C-x C-f, <menu-bar> <file> <new-file>.

This has been changed to:

    It is bound to <open> and C-x C-f.
    It can also be invoked from the menu: File → Visit New File...

+++
*** The 'C-h .' command now accepts a prefix argument.
'C-u C-h .' would previously inhibit displaying a warning message if
there's no local help at point.  This has been changed to call
'button-describe'/'widget-describe' and display button/widget help
instead.

---
*** New user option 'help-enable-variable-value-editing'.
If enabled, 'e' on a value in "*Help*" will pop you to a new buffer
where you can edit the value.  This is not enabled by default, because
it's easy to make an edit that yields an invalid result.

---
*** 'C-h b' uses outlining by default.
Set 'describe-bindings-outline' to nil to get the old behavior.

---
*** Jumping to function/variable source now saves mark before moving point.
Jumping to source from "*Help*" buffer moves the point when the source
buffer is already open.  Now, the old point is pushed to mark ring.

+++
*** New key bindings in "*Help*" buffers: 'n' and 'p'.
These will take you (respectively) to the next and previous "page".

---
*** 'describe-char' now also outputs the name of emoji combinations.

+++
*** New key binding in "*Help*" buffer: 'I'.
This will take you to the Emacs Lisp manual entry for the item
displayed, if any.

---
*** The 'C-h m' ('describe-mode') "*Help*" buffer has been reformatted.
It now only includes local minor modes at the start, and the global
minor modes are listed after the major mode.

+++
*** The user option 'help-window-select' now affects apropos commands.
The apropos commands will now select the apropos window if
'help-window-select' is non-nil.

---
*** 'describe-keymap' now considers the symbol at point.
If the symbol at point is a keymap, 'describe-keymap' suggests it as
the default candidate.

** Outline Mode

+++
*** Support for customizing the default visibility state of headings.
Customize the user option 'outline-default-state' to define what
headings will be visible after Outline mode is turned on.  When equal
to a number, the user option 'outline-default-rules' determines the
visibility of the subtree starting at the corresponding level.  Values
are provided to control showing a heading subtree depending on whether
the heading matches a regexp, or on whether its subtree has long lines
or is itself too long.

** Outline Minor Mode

+++
*** New user option 'outline-minor-mode-use-buttons'.
If non-nil, Outline Minor Mode will use buttons to hide/show outlines
in addition to the ellipsis.  The default is nil in editing modes, but
non-nil in 'special-mode' and its derivatives.

** Windows

+++
*** New commands 'split-root-window-below' and 'split-root-window-right'.
These commands split the root window in to, and are are bound to 'C-x
7' and 'C-x 9' respectively.

+++
*** New user option 'display-buffer-avoid-small-windows'.
If non-nil, this should be a window height, a number.  Windows smaller
than this will be avoided by 'display-buffer', if possible.

+++
*** New display action 'display-buffer-full-frame'.
This action removes other windows on the frame when displaying a
buffer.

+++
*** 'display-buffer' now can set up the body size of the chosen window.
For example, a 'display-buffer-alist' entry of

    '(window-width . (body-columns . 40))'

will make the body of the chosen window 40 columns wide.  For the
height use 'window-height' in combination with 'body-lines'.

---
*** You can customize which window 'scroll-other-window' operates on.
This is controlled by the new 'other-window-scroll-default' user option.

** Frames

+++
*** Deleted frames can now be undeleted.
The 16 most recently deleted frames can be undeleted with 'C-x 5 u' when
'undelete-frame-mode' is enabled.  Without a prefix argument, undelete
the most recently deleted frame.  With a numerical prefix argument
between 1 and 16, where 1 is the most recently deleted frame, undelete
the corresponding deleted frame.

** Tab Bars and Tab Lines

---
*** 'C-x t RET' creates a new tab when the provided tab name doesn't exist.

---
*** New keymap 'tab-bar-history-mode-map'.
By default, it contains 'C-c <left>' and 'C-c <right>' to browse
the history of tab window configurations back and forward.

---
** Better detection of text suspiciously reordered on display.
The function 'bidi-find-overridden-directionality' has been extended
to detect reordering effects produced by embeddings and isolates
(started by directional formatting control characters such as RLO and
LRI).  The new command 'highlight-confusing-reorderings' finds and
highlights segments of buffer text whose reordering for display is
suspicious and could be malicious.

** Emacs server and client changes

+++
*** New command-line option '-r'/'--reuse-frame' for emacsclient.
With this command-line option, Emacs reuses an existing graphical client
frame if one exists; otherwise it creates a new frame.

+++
*** New command-line option '-w N'/'--timeout=N' for emacsclient.
With this command-line option, emacsclient will exit if Emacs does not
respond within N seconds.  The default is to wait forever.

+++
*** 'server-stop-automatically' can be used to automatically stop the server.
The Emacs server will be automatically stopped when certain conditions
are met.  The conditions are given by the argument, which can be
'empty', 'delete-frame' or 'kill-terminal'.

** Rcirc

+++
*** New command 'rcirc-when'.

+++
*** New user option 'rcirc-cycle-completion-flag'.
Rcirc will use the default 'completion-at-point' mechanism.  The
conventional IRC behavior of completing by cycling through the
available options can be restored by enabling this option.

** Imenu

+++
*** 'imenu' is now bound to 'M-g i' globally.

---
*** New function 'imenu-flush-cache'.
Use it if you want Imenu to forget the buffer's index alist and
recreate it anew next time 'imenu' is invoked.

+++
** Emacs is now capable of abandoning a window's redisplay that takes too long.
This is controlled by the new variable 'max-redisplay-ticks'.  If that
variable is set to a non-zero value, display of a window will be
aborted after that many low-level redisplay operations, thus
preventing Emacs from becoming wedged when visiting files with very
long lines.

* Editing Changes in Emacs 29.1

+++
** 'M-SPC' is now bound to 'cycle-spacing'.
Formerly it invoked 'just-one-space'.  The actions performed by
'cycle-spacing' and their order can now be customized via the user
option 'cycle-spacing-actions'.

---
** 'zap-to-char' and 'zap-up-to-char' are case-sensitive for upper-case chars.
These commands now behave as case-sensitive for interactive calls when
they are invoked with an uppercase character, regardless of the
'case-fold-search' value.

---
** 'scroll-other-window' and 'scroll-other-window-down' now respect remapping.
These commands (bound to 'C-M-v' and 'C-M-V') used to scroll the other
windows without looking a customizations in that other window.  These
functions now check whether they have been rebound in the buffer in
that other window, and then call the remapped function instead.  In
addition, these commands now also respect the
'scroll-error-top-bottom' user option.

---
** Indentation of 'cl-flet' and 'cl-labels' has changed.
These forms now indent like this:

    (cl-flet ((bla (x)
                (* x x)))
      (bla 42))

This change also affects 'cl-macrolet', 'cl-flet*' and
'cl-symbol-macrolet'.

+++
** New user option 'translate-upper-case-key-bindings'.
Set this option to nil to inhibit translating upper case keys to lower
case keys.

+++
** New command 'ensure-empty-lines'.
This command increases (or decreases) the number of empty lines before
point.

---
** Improved mouse behavior with auto-scrolling modes.
When clicking inside the 'scroll-margin' or 'hscroll-margin' region,
point is now moved only when releasing the mouse button.  This no
longer results in a bogus selection, unless the mouse has been
effectively dragged.

+++
** 'kill-ring-max' now defaults to 120.

---
** New user option 'yank-menu-max-items'.
Customize this option to limit the number of entries in the menu
"Edit->Paste from Kill Menu".  The default is 60.

+++
** Performing a pinch gesture on a touchpad now increases the text scale.

** show-paren-mode

+++
*** New user option 'show-paren-context-when-offscreen'.
When non-nil, if the point is in a closing delimiter and the opening
delimiter is offscreen, shows some context around the opening
delimiter in the echo area.  The default is nil.

May also be set to the symbols 'overlay' or 'child-frame', in which
case the context is shown in an overlay or child-frame at the top-left
of the current window.  The latter option requires a graphical frame.
On non-graphical frames, the context is shown in the echo area.

** Comint

+++
*** 'comint-term-environment' is now aware of connection-local variables.
The user option 'comint-terminfo-terminal' and the variable
'system-uses-terminfo' can now be set as connection-local variables to
change the terminal used on a remote host.

---
*** New user option 'comint-delete-old-input'.
When nil, this prevents comint from deleting the current input when
inserting previous input using '<mouse-2>'.  The default is t, to
preserve past behavior.

** Mwheel

---
*** New user options for alternate wheel events.
The options 'mouse-wheel-down-alternate-event',
'mouse-wheel-up-alternate-event', 'mouse-wheel-left-alternate-event',
and 'mouse-wheel-right-alternate-event' have been added to better
support systems where two kinds of wheel events can be received.

** Internationalization changes

*** The <Delete> function key now allows deleting the entire composed sequence.
For the details, see the item about the 'delete-forward-char' command
above.

*** New user option 'composition-break-at-point'.
Setting it to a non-nil value temporarily disables automatic
composition of character sequences at point, and thus makes it easier
to edit such sequences by allowing point to "enter" the sequence.

---
*** Support for many old scripts and writing systems.
Emacs now supports and has language-environments and input methods for
several dozens of old scripts that were used in the past for various
languages in South and South-East Asia.  For each such script Emacs
now has font-selection and character composition rules, a language
environment, and an input method.  The newly-added scripts and the
corresponding language environments are:

Tai Tham script and the Northern Thai language environment
Brahmi script and language environment
Kaithi script and language environment
Tirhuta script and language environment
Sharada script and language environment
Siddham script and language environment
Syloti Nagri script and language environment
Modi script and language environment
Baybayin script and Tagalog language environment
Hanunoo script and language environment
Buhid script and language environment
Tagbanwa script and language environment
Limbu script and language environment
Balinese script and language environment
Javanese script and language environment
Sundanese script and language environment
Batak script and language environment
Rejang script and language environment
Makasar script and language environment
Lontara script and language environment
Hanifi Rohingya script and language environment
Grantha script and language environment
Kharoshthi script and language environment
Lepcha script and language environment
Meetei Mayek script and language environment

---
*** The "Oriya" language environment was renamed to "Odia".
This is to follow the change in the official name of the script.  The
'oriya' input method was also renamed to 'odia'.  However, the old
name of the language environment and the input method are still
supported.

---
*** New Greek translation of the Emacs tutorial.
Type 'C-u C-h t' to select it in case your language setup does not do
so automatically.

---
*** New default phonetic input method for the Tamil language environment.
The default input method for the Tamil language environment is now
"tamil-phonetic" which is a customizable phonetic input method.  To
change the input method's translation rules, customize the user option
'tamil-translation-rules'.


* Changes in Specialized Modes and Packages in Emacs 29.1

** ecomplete

---
*** New user option 'ecomplete-auto-select'.
If non-nil and there's only one matching option, auto-select that.

** Dired

+++
*** 'dired-guess-shell-command' moved from dired-x to dired.
This means that 'dired-do-shell-command' will now provide smarter
defaults without first having to require 'dired-x'.  See the node
"(emacs) Shell Command Guessing" in the Emacs manual for more details.

---
*** 'dired-clean-up-buffers-too' moved from dired-x to dired.
This means that Dired now offers to kill buffers visiting files and
dirs when they are deleted in Dired.  Before, you had to require
'dired-x' to enable this behavior.  To disable this behavior,
customize the user option 'dired-clean-up-buffers-too' to nil.  The
related user option 'dired-clean-confirm-killing-deleted-buffers'
(which see) has also been moved to 'dired'.

+++
*** 'dired-do-relsymlink' moved from dired-x to dired.
The corresponding key 'Y' is now bound by default in Dired.

+++
*** 'dired-do-relsymlink-regexp' moved from dired-x to dired.
The corresponding key '% Y' is now bound by default in Dired.

---
*** 'M-G' is now bound to 'dired-goto-subdir'.
Before, that binding was only available if the dired-x package was
loaded.

+++
*** 'dired-info' and 'dired-man' moved from dired-x to dired.
The 'dired-info' and 'dired-man' commands have been moved from the
dired-x package to dired.  They have also been renamed to
'dired-do-info' and 'dired-do-man'; the old command names are obsolete
aliases.

The keys 'I' ('dired-do-info') and 'N' ('dired-do-man') are now bound
in Dired mode by default.  The user options 'dired-bind-man' and
'dired-bind-info' no longer have any effect and are obsolete.

To get the old behavior back and unbind these keys in Dired mode, add
the following to your Init file:

    (with-eval-after-load 'dired
      (keymap-set dired-mode-map "N" nil)
      (keymap-set dired-mode-map "I" nil))

---
*** New command 'dired-do-eww'.
This command visits the file on the current line with EWW.

** Elisp

---
*** New command 'elisp-eval-buffer' (bound to 'C-c C-e').
This command evals the forms in the current buffer.

---
*** New commands 'elisp-byte-compile-file' and 'elisp-byte-compile-buffer'.
These commands (bound to 'C-c C-f' and 'C-c C-b', respectively)
byte-compile the visited file and the current buffer, respectively.

** Games

---
*** New user option 'tetris-allow-repetitions'.
This controls how randomness is implemented (whether to use pure
randomness as before or whether to use a bag).

** Battery

+++
*** New user option 'battery-update-functions'.
This can be used to trigger actions based on the battery status.

** Enriched Mode

+++
*** New command 'enriched-toggle-markup'.
This allows you to see the markup in 'enriched-mode' buffers (e.g.,
the "HELLO" file).

** Shell Script Mode

---
*** New user option 'sh-indent-statement-after-and'.
This controls how statements like the following are indented:

    foo &&
        bar

** Cperl Mode

---
*** New user option 'cperl-file-style'.
This option determines the indentation style to be used.  It can also
be used as a file-local variable.

** Gud

---
*** 'gud-go' is now bound to 'C-c C-v'.
If given a prefix, it will query the user for an argument to use for
the run/continue command.

---
*** 'perldb' now recognizes '-E'.
As of Perl 5.10, 'perl -E 0' behaves like 'perl -e 0' but also activates
all optional features of the Perl version in use.  'perldb' now uses
this invocation as its default.

** Customize

---
*** New command 'custom-toggle-hide-all-widgets'.
This is bound to 'H' and toggles whether to hide or show the widget
contents.

** Diff mode

---
*** New user option 'diff-whitespace-style'.
Sets the value of the buffer-local variable 'whitespace-style' in
'diff-mode' buffers.  By default, this variable is '(face trailing)',
which preserves behavior from previous Emacs versions.

+++
*** New user option 'diff-add-log-use-relative-names'.
If non-nil insert file names in ChangeLog skeletons relative to the
VC root directory.

** Ispell

---
*** 'ispell-region' and 'ispell-buffer' now push the mark.
These commands push onto the mark ring the location of the last
misspelled word where corrections were offered, so that you can then
skip back to that location with 'C-x C-x'.

** Dabbrev

---
*** New function 'dabbrev-capf' for use on 'completion-at-point-functions'.

+++
*** New user option 'dabbrev-ignored-buffer-modes'.
Buffers with major modes in this list will be ignored.  By default,
this includes "binary" buffers like 'archive-mode' and 'image-mode'.

** Package

+++
*** New command 'package-update'.
This command allows you to upgrade packages without using 'M-x
list-packages'.

+++
*** New command 'package-update-all'.
This command allows updating all packages without any queries.

+++
*** New commands 'package-recompile' and 'package-recompile-all'.
These commands can be useful if the ".elc" files are out of date
(invalid byte code and macros).

+++
*** New DWIM action on 'x' in "*Packages*" buffer.
If no packages are marked, 'x' will install the package under point if
it isn't already, and remove it if it is installed.

** Miscellaneous

+++
*** New command 'scratch-buffer'.
This command switches to the "*scratch*" buffer.  If "*scratch*" doesn't
exist, the command creates it first.  You can use this command if you
inadvertently delete the "*scratch*" buffer.

** Debugging

---
*** 'q' in a "*Backtrace*" buffer no longer clears the buffer.
Instead it just buries the buffer and switches the mode from
'debugger-mode' to 'backtrace-mode', since commands like 'e' are no
longer available after exiting the recursive edit.

+++
*** New user option 'debug-allow-recursive-debug'.
This user option controls whether the 'e' (in a "*Backtrace*"
buffer or while edebugging) and 'C-x C-e' (while edebugging) commands
lead to a (further) backtrace.  By default, this variable is nil,
which is a change in behavior from previous Emacs versions.

+++
*** 'e' in edebug can now take a prefix arg to pretty-print the results.
When invoked with a prefix argument, as in 'C-u e', this command will
pop up a new buffer and show the full pretty-printed value there.

+++
*** 'C-x C-e' now interprets a non-zero prefix arg to pretty-print the results.
When invoked with a non-zero prefix argument, as in 'C-u C-x C-e',
this command will pop up a new buffer and show the full pretty-printed
value there.

+++
*** You can now generate a backtrace from Lisp errors in redisplay.
To do this, set the new variable 'backtrace-on-redisplay-error' to a
non-nil value.  The backtrace will be written to a special buffer
named "*Redisplay-trace*".  This buffer will not be automatically
displayed in a window.

** Compile

+++
*** New user option 'compilation-hidden-output'.
This can be used to make specific parts of compilation output
invisible.

+++
*** The 'compilation-auto-jump-to-first-error' user option has been extended.
It can now have the additional values 'if-location-known' (which will
only jump if the location of the first error is known), and
'first-known' (which will jump to the first known error location).

+++
*** New user option 'compilation-max-output-line-length'.
Lines longer than this will have the ends hidden, with a button to
reveal the hidden text.  This speeds up operations like grepping on
files that have few newlines.

** Flymake

+++
*** New user option 'flymake-mode-line-lighter'.

+++
** New minor mode 'word-wrap-whitespace-mode' for extending 'word-wrap'.
This mode switches 'word-wrap' on, and breaks on all the whitespace
characters instead of just 'SPC' and 'TAB'.

---
** New mode, 'emacs-news-mode', for editing the NEWS file.
This mode adds some highlighting, fixes the 'M-q' command, and has
commands for doing maintenance of the Emacs NEWS files.  In addition,
this mode turns on 'outline-minor-mode', and thus displays
customizable icons (see 'icon-preference') on heading lines.  To
disable these icons, customize 'outline-minor-mode-use-buttons' to a
nil value.

---
** Kmacro
Kmacros are now OClosures and have a new constructor 'kmacro' which
uses the 'key-parse' syntax.  It replaces the old 'kmacro-lambda-form'
(which is now declared obsolete).

---
** 'savehist.el' can now truncate variables that are too long.
An element of 'savehist-additional-variables' can now be of the form
'(VARIABLE . MAX-ELTS)', which means to truncate the VARIABLE's value to
at most MAX-ELTS elements (if the value is a list) before saving the
value.

** Minibuffer and Completions

+++
*** New commands for navigating completions from the minibuffer.
When the minibuffer is the current buffer, typing 'M-<up>' or
'M-<down>' selects a previous/next completion candidate from the
"*Completions*" buffer and inserts it to the minibuffer.
When the user option 'minibuffer-completion-auto-choose' is nil,
'M-<up>' and 'M-<down>' do the same, but without inserting
a completion candidate to the minibuffer, then 'M-RET' can be used
to choose the currently active candidate from the "*Completions*"
buffer and exit the minibuffer.  With a prefix argument, 'C-u M-RET'
inserts the currently active candidate to the minibuffer, but doesn't
exit the minibuffer.  These keys are also available for in-buffer
completion, but they don't insert candidates automatically, you need
to type 'M-RET' to insert the selected candidate to the buffer.

+++
*** The "*Completions*" buffer can now be automatically selected.
To enable this behavior, customize the user option
'completion-auto-select' to t, then pressing 'TAB' will switch to the
"*Completions*" buffer when it pops up that buffer.  If the value is
'second-tab', then the first 'TAB' will display "*Completions*", and
the second one will switch to the "*Completions*" buffer.

---
*** New user option 'completion-auto-wrap'.
When non-nil, the commands 'next-completion' and 'previous-completion'
automatically wrap around on reaching the beginning or the end of
the "*Completions*" buffer.

+++
*** New values for the 'completion-auto-help' user option.
There are two new values to control the way the "*Completions*" buffer
behaves after pressing a 'TAB' if completion is not unique.  The value
'always' updates or shows the "*Completions*" buffer after any attempt
to complete.  The value 'visual' is like 'always', but only updates
the completions if they are already visible.  The default value 't'
always hides the completion buffer after some completion is made.

*** New commands to complete the minibuffer history.
'minibuffer-complete-history' ('C-x <up>') is like 'minibuffer-complete'
but completes on the history items instead of the default completion
table.  'minibuffer-complete-defaults' ('C-x <down>') completes
on the list of default items.

+++
*** New user option 'completions-sort'.
This option controls the sorting of the completion candidates in
the "*Completions*" buffer.  Available styles are no sorting,
alphabetical (the default), or a custom sort function.

+++
*** New user option 'completions-max-height'.
This option limits the height of the "*Completions*" buffer.

+++
*** New user option 'completions-header-format'.
This is a string to control the heading line to show in the
"*Completions*" buffer before the list of completions.
If it contains "%s", that is replaced with the number of completions.
If nil, the heading line is not shown.

+++
*** New user option 'completions-highlight-face'.
When this user option names a face, the current
candidate in the "*Completions*" buffer is highlighted with that face.
The nil value disables this highlighting.

+++
*** Choosing a completion with a prefix argument doesn't exit the minibuffer.
This means that typing 'C-u RET' on a completion candidate in the
"*Completions*" buffer inserts the completion to the minibuffer,
but doesn't exit the minibuffer.

+++
*** You can now define abbrevs for the fundamental minibuffer modes.
'minibuffer-mode-abbrev-table' and
'minibuffer-inactive-mode-abbrev-table' are now defined.

** Isearch and Replace

+++
*** Changes in how Isearch responds to 'mouse-yank-at-point'.
If a user does 'C-s' and then uses '<mouse-2>' ('mouse-yank-primary')
outside the echo area, Emacs will, by default, end the Isearch and
yank the text at mouse cursor.  But if 'mouse-yank-at-point' is
non-nil, the text will now be added to the Isearch instead.

+++
*** Changes for values 'no' and 'no-ding' of 'isearch-wrap-pause'.
Now with these values the search will wrap around not only on repeating
with 'C-s C-s', but also after typing a character.

+++
*** New user option 'char-fold-override'.
Non-nil means that the default definitions of equivalent characters
are overridden.

*** New command 'describe-char-fold-equivalences'.
It displays character equivalences used by `char-fold-to-regexp'.

+++
*** New command 'isearch-emoji-by-name'.
It is bound to 'C-x 8 e RET' during an incremental search.  The
command accepts the Unicode name of an Emoji (for example, "smiling
face" or "heart with arrow"), like 'C-x 8 e e', with minibuffer
completion, and adds the Emoji into the search string.

** Glyphless characters

+++
*** New minor mode 'glyphless-display-mode'.
This allows an easy way to toggle seeing all glyphless characters in
the current buffer.

---
*** The extra slot of 'glyphless-char-display' can now have cons values.
The extra slot of the 'glyphless-char-display' char-table can now have
values that are cons cells, specifying separate values for text-mode
and GUI terminals.

+++
*** "Replacement character" feature for undisplayable characters on TTYs.
The 'acronym' method of displaying glyphless characters on text-mode
frames treats single-character acronyms specially: they are displayed
without the surrounding [..] "box", thus in effect treating such
"acronyms" as replacement characters.

** Registers

+++
*** Buffer names can now be stored in registers.
For instance, to enable jumping to the "*Messages*" buffer with
'C-x r j m':

    (set-register ?m '(buffer . "*Messages*"))

** Pixel-fill

+++
*** This is a new package that deals with filling variable-pitch text.

+++
*** New function 'pixel-fill-region'.
This fills the region to be no wider than a specified pixel width.

** Info

+++
*** 'M-x info-apropos' now takes a prefix argument to search for regexps.

---
*** New command 'Info-goto-node-web' and key binding 'G'.
This will take you to the gnu.org web server's version of the current
info node.  This command only works for the Emacs and Emacs Lisp manuals.

** VC

+++
*** New command '%' ('vc-dir-mark-by-regexp').
This command marks files based on a regexp.  If given a prefix
argument, unmark instead.

---
*** 'C-x v v' in a diffs buffer allows to commit only some of the changes.
This command is intended to allow you to commit only some of the
changes you have in your working tree.  Begin by creating a buffer
with the changes against the last commit, e.g. with 'C-x v D'
('vc-root-diff').  Then edit the diffs to remove the hunks you don't
want to commit.  Finally, type 'C-x v v' in that diff buffer to commit
only part of your changes, those whose hunks were left in the buffer.

Currently this feature works only with the Git as 'vc-backend'.

---
*** 'C-x v v' on an unregistered file will now use the most specific backend.
Previously, if you had an SVN-covered "~/" directory, and a Git-covered
directory in "~/foo/bar", using 'C-x v v' on a new, unregistered file
"~/foo/bar/zot" would register it in the SVN repository in "~/" instead of
in the Git repository in "~/foo/bar".  This makes this command
consistent with 'vc-responsible-backend'.

---
*** Log Edit now font locks long Git commit summary lines.
Writing shorter summary lines avoids truncation in contexts in which
Git commands display summary lines.  See the two new variables
'vc-git-log-edit-summary-target-len' and 'vc-git-log-edit-summary-max-len'.

** Message

---
*** New user option 'mml-attach-file-at-the-end'.
If non-nil, 'C-c C-a' will put attached files at the end of the message.

---
*** Message Mode now supports image yanking.

+++
*** New user option 'message-server-alist'.
This controls automatic insertion of the "X-Message-SMTP-Method"
header before sending a message.

** HTML Mode

---
*** HTML Mode now supports "text/html" and "image/*" yanking.

** Texinfo Mode

---
*** 'texinfo-mode' now has a specialized 'narrow-to-defun' definition.
It narrows to the current node.

** EUDC

+++
*** 'eudc-expansion-overwrites-query' to 'eudc-expansion-save-query-as-kill'.
'eudc-expansion-overwrites-query' is renamed to
'eudc-expansion-save-query-as-kill' to reflect the actual behavior of
the user option.

+++
*** New command 'eudc-expand-try-all'.
This command can be used in place of 'eudc-expand-inline'.  It takes a
prefix argument that causes 'eudc-expand-try-all' to return matches
from all servers instead of just the matches from the first server to
return any.  This is useful for example, if one wants to search LDAP
for a name that happens to match a contact in one's BBDB.

+++
*** New behavior and default for user option 'eudc-inline-expansion-format'.
EUDC inline expansion result formatting defaulted to

    '("%s %s <%s>" firstname name email)

Since email address specifications need to comply with RFC 5322 in
order to be useful in messages, there was a risk to produce syntax
which was standard with RFC 822, but is marked as obsolete syntax by
its successor RFC 5322.  Also, the first and last name part was never
enclosed in double quotes, potentially producing invalid address
specifications, which may be rejected by a receiving MTA.  Thus, this
variable can now additionally be set to nil (the new default), or a
function.  In both cases, the formatted result will be in compliance
with RFC 5322.  When set to nil, a default format very similar to the
old default will be produced.  When set to a function, that function
is called, and the returned values are used to populate the phrase and
comment parts (see RFC 5322 for definitions).  In both cases, the
phrase part will be automatically quoted if necessary.

+++
*** New function 'eudc-capf-complete' with 'message-mode' integration.
EUDC can now contribute email addresses to 'completion-at-point' by
adding the new function 'eudc-capf-complete' to
'completion-at-point-functions' in 'message-mode'.

+++
*** Additional attributes of query and results in eudcb-macos-contacts.el.
The EUDC back-end for the macOS Contacts app now provides a wider set
of attributes to use for queries, and delivers more attributes in
query results.

** EWW/SHR

+++
*** New user option to automatically rename EWW buffers.
The 'eww-auto-rename-buffer' user option can be configured to rename
rendered web pages by using their title, URL, or a user-defined
function which returns a string.  For the first two cases, the length
of the resulting name is controlled by 'eww-buffer-name-length'.  By
default, no automatic renaming is performed.

+++
*** New user option 'shr-allowed-images'.
This complements 'shr-blocked-images', but allows specifying just the
allowed images.

+++
*** New user option 'shr-use-xwidgets-for-media'.
If non-nil (and Emacs has been built with support for xwidgets),
display <video> elements with an xwidget.  Note that this is
experimental; it is known to crash Emacs on some systems, and just
doesn't work on other systems.  Also see etc/PROBLEMS.

+++
*** New user option 'eww-url-transformers'.
These are used to alter an URL before using it.  By default it removes
the common "utm_" trackers from URLs.

** Find-Dired

---
*** New command 'find-dired-with-command'.
This enables users to run 'find-dired' with an arbitrary command,
enabling running commands previously unsupported and also enabling new
commands to be built on top.

** Gnus

+++
*** Tool bar changes in Gnus/Message.
There were previously two styles of tool bars available in Gnus and
Message, referred to as 'gnus-summary-tool-bar-retro',
'gnus-group-tool-bar-retro' and 'message-tool-bar-retro', and
'gnus-summary-tool-bar-gnome', 'gnus-group-tool-bar-gnome' and
'message-tool-bar-gnome'.  The "retro" tool bars have been removed (as
well as the icons used), and the "Gnome" tool bars are now the only
pre-defined toolbars.

---
*** 'gnus-summary-up-thread' and 'gnus-summary-down-thread' bindings removed.
The 'gnus-summary-down-thread' binding to "M-C-d" was shadowed by
'gnus-summary-read-document', and these commands are also available on
"T-u" and "T-d" respectively.

---
*** Gnus now uses a variable-pitch font in the headers by default.
To get the monospace font back, you can put something like the
following in your ".gnus" file:

    (set-face-attribute 'gnus-header nil :inherit 'unspecified)

---
*** The default value of 'gnus-treat-fold-headers' is now 'head'.

---
*** New face 'gnus-header'.
All other 'gnus-header-*' faces inherit from this face now.

+++
*** New user option 'gnus-treat-emojize-symbols'.
If non-nil, symbols that have an emoji representation will be
displayed as emojis.  The default is nil.

+++
*** New command 'gnus-article-emojize-symbols'.
This is bound to 'W D e' and will display symbols that have emoji
representation as emojis.

+++
*** New mu backend for gnus-search.
Configuration is very similar to the notmuch and namazu backends.  It
supports the unified search syntax.

---
*** 'gnus-html-image-cache-ttl' is now a seconds count.
Formerly it was a pair of numbers '(A B)' that represented 65536*A + B,
to cater to older Emacs implementations that lacked bignums.
The older form still works but is undocumented.

** EIEIO

+++
*** 'slot-value' can now be used to access slots of 'cl-defstruct' objects.

** Align

---
*** Alignment in 'text-mode' has changed.
Previously, 'M-x align' didn't do anything, and you had to say 'C-u
M-x align' for it to work.  This has now been changed.  The default
regexp for 'C-u M-x align-regexp' has also been changed to be easier
for inexperienced users to use.

** Help

---
*** New mode, 'emacs-news-view-mode', for viewing the NEWS file.
This mode is used by the 'C-h N' command, and adds buttons to manual
entries and symbol references.

---
*** New user option 'help-link-key-to-documentation'.
When this option is non-nil (which is the default), key bindings
displayed in the "*Help*" buffer will be linked to the documentation
for the command they are bound to.  This does not affect listings of
key bindings and functions (such as 'C-h b').

** Info-look

---
*** info-look specs can now be expanded at run time instead of a load time.
The new ':doc-spec-function' element can be used to compute the
':doc-spec' element when the user asks for info on that particular
mode (instead of at load time).

** Ansi-color

---
*** Support for ANSI 256-color and 24-bit colors.
256-color and 24-bit color codes are now handled by ANSI color
filters and displayed with the specified color.

** Term-mode

---
*** New user option 'term-bind-function-keys'.
If non-nil, 'term-mode' will pass the function keys on to the
underlying shell instead of using the normal Emacs bindings.

---
*** Support for ANSI 256-color and 24-bit colors, italic and other fonts.
'term-mode' can now display 256-color and 24-bit color codes.  It can
also handle ANSI codes for faint, italic and blinking text, displaying
it with new 'term-{faint,italic,slow-blink,fast-blink}' faces.

** Xref

+++
*** 'project-find-file' and 'project-or-external-find-file' now accept
a prefix argument which is interpreted to mean "include all files".

+++
*** 'project-kill-buffers' can display the list of buffers to kill.
Customize the user option 'project-kill-buffers-display-buffer-list'
to enable the display of the buffer list.

+++
*** New command 'xref-go-forward'.
It is bound to 'C-M-,' and jumps to the location where 'xref-go-back'
('M-,', also known as 'xref-pop-marker-stack') was invoked previously.

+++
*** 'xref-query-replace-in-results' prompting change.
This command no longer prompts for FROM when called without prefix
argument.  This makes the most common case faster: replacing entire
matches.

+++
*** New command 'xref-find-references-and-replace' to rename one identifier.

---
*** New variable 'xref-current-item' (renamed from a private version).

---
*** New function 'xref-show-xrefs'.

** File notifications

+++
*** The new command 'file-notify-rm-all-watches' removes all file notifications.

** Sql

---
*** Sql now supports sending of passwords in-process.
To improve security, if an sql product has ':password-in-comint' set
to t, a password supplied via the minibuffer will be sent in-process,
as opposed to via the command-line.

** Image Mode

+++
*** New command 'image-transform-fit-to-window'.
This command fits the image to the current window by scaling down or
up as necessary.  Unlike 'image-transform-fit-both', this does not
only scale the image down, but up as well.  It is bound to "s w" in
Image Mode by default.

+++
*** 'image-transform-fit-to-(height|width)' are now obsolete.
Use the new command 'image-transform-fit-to-window' instead.
The keybinding for 'image-transform-fit-to-width' is now 's i'.

---
*** User option 'image-auto-resize' can now be set to 'fit-window'.
This works like 'image-transform-fit-to-window'.

---
*** New user option 'image-auto-resize-max-scale-percent'.
The new 'fit-window' option will never scale an image more than this
much (in percent).  It is nil by default, which means no limit.

---
*** New user option 'image-text-based-formats'.
This controls whether or not to show a message when opening certain
image formats saying how to edit it as text.  The default is to show
this message for SVG and XPM.

+++
*** New commands: 'image-flip-horizontally' and 'image-flip-vertically'.
These commands horizontally and vertically flip the image under point.

+++
*** New command 'image-transform-set-percent'.
It allows setting the image size to a percentage of its original size,
and is bound to "s p" in Image mode.

** Images

+++
*** Users can now add special image conversion functions.
This is done via 'image-converter-add-handler'.

** Image-Dired

+++
*** 'image-dired-display-image-mode' is now based on 'image-mode'.
This avoids converting images in the background, and makes Image-Dired
noticeably faster.  New keybindings from 'image-mode' are now
available in the "*image-dired-display-image*" buffer; press '?' or
'h' in that buffer to see the full list.  Finally, some commands and
user options that are no longer needed are now obsolete:
'image-dired-cmd-create-temp-image-options',
'image-dired-cmd-create-temp-image-program',
'image-dired-display-current-image-full',
'image-dired-display-current-image-sized',
'image-dired-display-window-height-correction',
'image-dired-display-window-width-correction',
'image-dired-temp-image-file'.

---
*** Navigation and marking commands now work in image display buffer.
The following new bindings have been added:

    n or SPC  image-dired-display-next-thumbnail-original
    p or DEL  image-dired-display-previous-thumbnail-original
    m         image-dired-mark-thumb-original-file
    d         image-dired-flag-thumb-original-file
    u         image-dired-unmark-thumb-original-file

---
*** Reduce dependency on external "exiftool" command.
The 'image-dired-copy-with-exif-file-name' no longer requires an
external "exiftool" command to be available.  The user options
'image-dired-cmd-read-exif-data-program' and
'image-dired-cmd-read-exif-data-options' are now obsolete.

---
*** New command for the thumbnail buffer.
The new command 'image-dired-unmark-all-marks' has been added.  It is
bound to 'U' in the thumbnail and display buffer.

---
*** Support Thumbnail Managing Standard v0.9.0 (Dec 2020).
This standard allows sharing generated thumbnails across different
programs.  Version 0.9.0 adds two larger thumbnail sizes: 512x512 and
1024x1024 pixels.  See the user option 'image-dired-thumbnail-storage'
to use it; it is not enabled by default.

---
*** Support GraphicsMagick command line tools.
Support for the GraphicsMagick command line tool ("gm") has been
added, and is used instead of ImageMagick when it is available.

---
*** New face 'image-dired-thumb-flagged'.
If 'image-dired-thumb-mark' is non-nil (the default), this face is
used for images that are flagged for deletion in the Dired buffer
associated with Image-Dired.

---
*** 'image-dired-slideshow-start' is now bound to 'S'.
It is bound in both the thumbnail and display buffer.

---
*** The 'image-dired-slideshow-start' command no longer prompts.
It no longer inconveniently prompts for a number of images and a
delay: it runs indefinitely, but stops automatically on any command.
You can set the delay with a prefix argument, or a negative prefix
argument to prompt for a delay.  Customize the user option
'image-dired-slideshow-delay' to change the default from 5 seconds.

---
*** Support for bookmark.el.
The command 'bookmark-set' (bound to 'C-x r m') is now supported in
the thumbnail view, and will create a bookmark that opens the current
directory in Image-Dired.

---
*** New user option 'image-dired-marking-shows-next'.
If this option is non-nil (the default), marking, unmarking or
flagging an image in either the thumbnail or display buffer shows the
next image.

---
*** Image information is now shown in the header line.
This replaces the message most navigation commands in the thumbnail
buffer used to show at the bottom of the screen.

+++
*** 'image-dired-show-all-from-dir-max-files' increased to 1000.
This user option controls asking for confirmation when starting
Image-Dired in a directory with many files.  Since Image-Dired creates
thumbnails in the background in recent versions, this is not as
important as it used to be.  You can now also customize this option to
nil to disable this confirmation completely.

---
*** 'image-dired-rotate-thumbnail-(left|right)' is now obsolete.
Instead, use commands 'image-dired-refresh-thumb' to generate a new
thumbnail, or 'image-rotate' to rotate the thumbnail without updating
the thumbnail file.

---
*** HTML image gallery generation is now obsolete.
The 'image-dired-gallery-generate' command and these user options are
now obsolete: 'image-dired-gallery-thumb-image-root-url',
'image-dired-gallery-hidden-tags', 'image-dired-gallery-dir',
'image-dired-gallery-image-root-url'.

** Dired

---
*** New user option 'dired-omit-lines'.
This is used by 'dired-omit-mode', and now allows you to hide based on
other things than just the file names.

+++
*** New user option 'dired-mouse-drag-files'.
If non-nil, dragging file names with the mouse in a Dired buffer will
initiate a drag-and-drop session allowing them to be opened in other
programs.

+++
*** New user option 'dired-free-space'.
Dired will now, by default, include the free space in the first line
instead of having it on a separate line.  To get the previous behavior
back, say:

    (setq dired-free-space 'separate)

---
*** New user option 'dired-make-directory-clickable'.
If non-nil (which is the default), hitting 'RET' or 'mouse-1' on
the directory components at the directory displayed at the start of
the buffer will take you to that directory.

---
*** Search and replace in Dired/Wdired supports more regexps.
For example, the regexp ".*" will match only characters that are part
of the file name.  Also "^.*$" can be used to match at the beginning
of the file name and at the end of the file name.  This is used only
when searching on file names.  In Wdired this can be used when the new
user option 'wdired-search-replace-filenames' is non-nil (which is the
default).

** Bookmarks

---
*** 'list-bookmarks' now includes a type column.
Types are registered via a 'bookmark-handler-type' symbol property on
the jumping function.

+++
*** 'bookmark-sort-flag' can now be set to 'last-modified'.
This will display bookmark list from most recently set to least
recently set.

---
*** When editing a bookmark annotation, 'C-c C-k' will now cancel.
It is bound to the new command 'bookmark-edit-annotation-cancel'.

---
*** New option 'bookmark-fringe-mark'.
This option controls the bitmap used to indicate bookmarks in the
fringe (or 'nil' to disable showing this marker).

** Exif

---
*** New function 'exif-field'.
This is a convenience function to extract the field data from
'exif-parse-file' and 'exif-parse-buffer'.

** Xwidgets

---
*** New user option 'xwidget-webkit-buffer-name-format'.
This option controls how xwidget-webkit buffers are named.

---
*** New user option 'xwidget-webkit-cookie-file'.
This option controls whether the xwidget-webkit buffers save cookies
set by web pages, and if so, in which file to save them.

+++
*** New minor mode 'xwidget-webkit-edit-mode'.
When this mode is enabled, self-inserting characters and other common
web browser shortcut keys are redefined to send themselves to the
WebKit widget.

+++
*** New minor mode 'xwidget-webkit-isearch-mode'.
This mode acts similarly to incremental search, and allows searching
the contents of a WebKit widget.  In xwidget-webkit mode, it is bound
to 'C-s' and 'C-r'.

+++
*** New command 'xwidget-webkit-browse-history'.
This command displays a buffer containing the page load history of
the current WebKit widget, and allows you to navigate it.

---
*** On X, the WebKit inspector is now available inside xwidgets.
To access the inspector, right click on the widget and select "Inspect
Element".

---
*** "Open in New Window" in a WebKit widget's context menu now works.
The newly created buffer will be displayed via 'display-buffer', which
can be customized through the usual mechanism of 'display-buffer-alist'
and friends.

** Tramp

---
*** Tramp supports abbreviating remote home directories now.
When calling 'abbreviate-file-name' on a Tramp file name, the result
will abbreviate the user's home directory, for example by abbreviating
"/ssh:user@host:/home/user" to "/ssh:user@host:~".

+++
*** New user option 'tramp-use-scp-direct-remote-copying'.
When set to non-nil, Tramp does not copy files between two remote
hosts via a local copy in its temporary directory, but lets the 'scp'
command do this job.

+++
*** Proper password prompts for methods "doas", "sudo" and "sudoedit".
The password prompts for these methods reflect now the credentials of
the user requesting such a connection, and not of the user who is the
target.  This has always been needed, just the password prompt and the
related 'auth-sources' entry were wrong.

** Browse URL

---
*** New user option 'browse-url-default-scheme'.
This user option decides which URL scheme that 'browse-url' and
related functions will use by default.  For example, you could
customize this to "https" to always prefer HTTPS URLs.

---
*** Support for the Netscape web browser has been removed.
This support has been obsolete since Emacs 25.1.  The final version of
the Netscape web browser was released in February, 2008.

---
*** Support for the Galeon web browser has been removed.
This support has been obsolete since Emacs 25.1.  The final version of
the Galeon web browser was released in September, 2008.

---
*** Support for the Mozilla web browser is now obsolete.
Note that this historical web browser is different from Mozilla
Firefox; it is its predecessor.

** Python Mode

+++
*** Project shells and a new user option 'python-shell-dedicated'.
When called with a prefix argument, 'run-python' now offers the choice
of creating a shell dedicated to the current project.  This shell runs
in the project root directory and is shared among all project buffers.

Without a prefix argument, the kind of shell (buffer-dedicated,
project-dedicated or global) is specified by the new
'python-shell-dedicated' variable.

** Ruby Mode

---
*** New user option 'ruby-toggle-block-space-before-parameters'.

** Eshell

+++
*** New feature to easily bypass Eshell's own pipelining.
Prefixing '|', '<' or '>' with an asterisk, i.e. '*|', '*<' or '*>',
will cause the whole command to be passed to the operating system
shell.  This is particularly useful to bypass Eshell's own pipelining
support for pipelines which will move a lot of data.  See section
"Running Shell Pipelines Natively" in the Eshell manual, node
"(eshell) Input/Output".

+++
*** New module to help supplying absolute file names to remote commands.
After enabling the new 'eshell-elecslash' module, typing a forward
slash as the first character of a command line argument will
automatically insert the Tramp prefix.  The automatic insertion
applies only when 'default-directory' is remote and the command is a
Lisp function.  This frees you from having to keep track of whether
commands are Lisp function or external when supplying absolute file
name arguments.  See "Electric forward slash" in the Eshell manual.

+++
*** Improved support for redirection operators in Eshell.
Eshell now supports a wider variety of redirection operators.  For
example, you can now redirect both stdout and stderr via '&>' or
duplicate one output handle to another via 'NEW-FD>&OLD-FD'.  For more
information, see "Redirections" in the Eshell manual.

+++
*** Double-quoting an Eshell expansion now treats the result as a single string.
If an Eshell expansion like '$FOO' is surrounded by double quotes, the
result will always be a single string, no matter the type that would
otherwise be returned.

+++
*** Concatenating Eshell expansions now works more similarly to other shells.
When concatenating an Eshell expansion that returns a list, "adjacent"
elements of each operand are now concatenated together,
e.g. '$list("a" "b")c' returns '("a" "bc")'.  See the "(eshell)
Expansion" node in the Eshell manual for more details.

+++
*** Eshell subcommands with multiline numeric output return lists of numbers.
If every line of the output of an Eshell subcommand like '${COMMAND}'
is numeric, the result will be a list of numbers (or a single number
if only one line of output).  Previously, this only converted numbers
when there was a single line of output.

---
*** Built-in Eshell commands now follow POSIX/GNU argument syntax conventions.
Built-in commands in Eshell now accept command-line options with
values passed as a single token, such as '-oVALUE' or
'--option=VALUE'.  New commands can take advantage of this with the
'eshell-eval-using-options' macro.  See "Defining new built-in
commands" in the "(eshell) Built-ins" node of the Eshell manual.

---
*** Eshell globs ending with '/' now match only directories.
Additionally, globs ending with '**/' or '***/' no longer raise an
error, and now expand to all directories recursively (following
symlinks in the latter case).

+++
*** Lisp forms in Eshell now treat a 'nil' result as a failed exit status.
When executing a command that looks like '(lisp form)', Eshell will
set the exit status (available in the '$?' variable) to 2.  This
allows commands like that to be used as conditionals.  To change this
behavior, customize the new 'eshell-lisp-form-nil-is-failure' option.

** Shell

---
*** New user option 'shell-kill-buffer-on-exit'.
Enabling this will automatically kill a "*shell*" buffer as soon as
the shell session terminates.

** Calc

+++
*** New user option 'calc-kill-line-numbering'.
Set it to nil to exclude line numbering from kills and copies.

** Miscellaneous

---
*** New user option 'webjump-use-internal-browser'.
When non-nil, WebJump will use an internal browser to open web pages,
instead of the default external browser.

+++
*** New user option 'font-lock-ignore'.
This option provides a mechanism to selectively disable font-lock
keyword-driven fontifications.

---
*** New user option 'auto-save-visited-predicate'.
This user option is a predicate function which is called by
'auto-save-visited-mode' to decide whether or not to save a buffer.
You can use it to automatically save only specific buffers, for
example buffers using a particular mode or in some directory.

---
*** New user option 'remote-file-name-inhibit-auto-save-visited'.
If this user option is non-nil, 'auto-save-visited-mode' will not
auto-save remote buffers.  The default is nil.

+++
*** New package vtable.el for formatting tabular data.
This package allows formatting data using variable-pitch fonts.
The resulting tables can display text in variable pitch fonts, text
using fonts of different sizes, and images.  See the "(vtable) Top"
manual for more details.

---
*** New minor mode 'elide-head-mode'.
Enabling this minor mode turns on hiding header material, like
'elide-head' does; disabling it shows the header.  The commands
'elide-head' and 'elide-head-show' are now obsolete.

+++
*** New user option 'project-vc-include-untracked'.
If non-nil, files untracked by a VCS are considered to be part of
the project by a VC project based on that VCS.

---
*** 'recentf-mode' now uses abbreviated file names by default.
This means that e.g. "/home/foo/bar" is now displayed as "~/bar".
Customize the user option 'recentf-filename-handlers' to nil to get
back the old behavior.

---
*** New command 'recentf-open'.
This command prompts for a recently opened file in the minibuffer, and
visits it.

---
*** 'ffap-machine-at-point' no longer pings hosts by default.
It will now simply look at a hostname to determine if it is valid,
instead of also trying to ping it.  Customize the user option
'ffap-machine-p-known' to 'ping' to get the old behavior back.

---
*** The 'run-dig' command is now obsolete; use 'dig' instead.

---
*** Some `bib-mode' commands and variables have been renamed.
To respect Emacs naming conventions, the variable 'unread-bib-file'
has been renamed to 'bib-unread-file'.  The following commands have
also been renamed:
    'addbib'           to  'bib-add'
    'return-key-bib'   to  'bib-return-key'
    'mark-bib'         to  'bib-mark'
    'unread-bib'       to  'bib-unread'

---
*** proced.el shows system processes of remote hosts.
When 'default-directory' is remote, and 'proced' is invoked with a
negative argument like 'C-u - proced', the system processes of that
remote host are shown.  Alternatively, the user option
'proced-show-remote-processes' can be set to non-nil.
'proced-signal-function' has been marked obsolete.

---
*** 'outlineify-sticky' command is renamed to 'allout-outlinify-sticky'.
The old name is still available as an obsolete function alias.


* New Modes and Packages in Emacs 29.1

+++
** New package 'oclosure'.
Allows the creation of "functions with slots" or "function objects"
via the macros 'oclosure-define' and 'oclosure-lambda'.

+++
*** New generic function 'oclosure-interactive-form'.
Used by 'interactive-form' when called on an OClosure.
This allows specific OClosure types to compute their interactive specs
on demand rather than precompute them when created.

---
** New theme 'leuven-dark'.
This is a dark version of the 'leuven' theme.

+++
** New mode 'erts-mode'.
This mode is used to edit files geared towards testing actions in
Emacs buffers, like indentation and the like.  The new ert function
'ert-test-erts-file' is used to parse these files.

---
** New mode 'js-json-mode'.
This is a lightweight variant of 'js-mode' that is used by default
when visiting JSON files.


* Incompatible Lisp Changes in Emacs 29.1

---
** 'find-image' now uses 'create-image'.
This means that images found through 'find-image' also have
auto-scaling applied.  (This only makes a difference on HiDPI
displays.)

+++
** Changes to "raw" in-memory xbm images are specified.
Some years back Emacs gained the ability to scale images, and you
could then specify ':width' and ':height' when using 'create-image' on all
image types -- except xbm images, because this format already used the
':width' and ':height' arguments to specify the width/height of the "raw"
in-memory format.  This meant that if you used these specifications
on, for instance, xbm files, Emacs would refuse to display them.  This
has been changed, and ':width'/':height' now works as with all other image
formats, and the way to specify the width/height of the "raw"
in-memory format is now by using ':data-width' and ':data-height'.

+++
** "loaddefs.el" generation has been reimplemented.
The various "loaddefs.el" files in the Emacs tree (which contain
information about autoloads, built-in packages and package prefixes)
used to be generated by functions in "autoloads.el".  These are now
generated by "loaddefs-gen.el" instead.  This leads to functionally
equivalent loaddef files, but they do not use exactly the same syntax,
so using 'M-x update-file-autoloads' no longer works.  (This didn't
work well in most files in the past, either, but it will now signal an
error in any file.)

In addition, files are scanned in a slightly different way.
Previously ';;;###' specs inside a top-level form (i.e., something
like '(when ... ;;;### ...)' would be ignored.  They are now parsed as
normal.

+++
** 'buffer-modified-p' has been extended.
This function was previously documented to return only nil or t.  This
has been changed to nil/'autosaved'/non-nil.  The new 'autosaved'
value means that the buffer is modified, but that it hasn't been
modified since the time of last auto-save.

---
** 'with-silent-modifications' also restores buffer autosave status.
'with-silent-modifications' is a macro meant to be used by the font
locking machinery to allow applying text properties without changing
the modification status of the buffer.  However, it didn't restore the
buffer autosave status, so applying font locking to a modified buffer
that had already been auto-saved would trigger another auto-saving.
This is no longer the case.

---
** 'prin1' doesn't always escape "." and "?" in symbols any more.
Previously, symbols like 'foo.bar' would be printed by 'prin1' as
"foo\.bar".  This now prints as "foo.bar" instead.  The Emacs Lisp
reader interprets these strings as referring to the same symbol, so
this is virtually always backwards-compatible, but there may
theoretically be code out there that expects a specific printed
representation.

The same is the case with the "?" character: The 'foo?' symbol is now
printed as "foo?" instead of "foo\?".

If the "." and "?" characters are the first character in the symbol,
they will still be escaped, so the '.foo' symbol is still printed as
"\.foo" and the '?bar' symbol is still printed as "\?bar".

+++
** Remapping 'mode-line' no longer works as expected.
'mode-line' is now the parent face of the new 'mode-line-active' face,
and remapping parent of basic faces does not work reliably.
Instead of remapping 'mode-line', you have to remap 'mode-line-active'.

+++
** 'make-process' has been extended to support ptys when ':stderr' is set.
Previously, setting ':stderr' to a non-nil value would force the
process's connection to use pipes.  Now, Emacs will use a pty for
stdin and stdout if requested no matter the value of ':stderr'.

---
** User option 'mail-source-ignore-errors' is now obsolete.
The whole mechanism for prompting users to continue in case of
mail-source errors has been removed, so this option is no longer
needed.

** Fonts

---
*** Emacs now supports 'medium' fonts.
Emacs previously didn't distinguish between the 'regular'/'normal'
weight and the 'medium' weight, but it now also supports the (heavier)
'medium' weight.  However, this means that if you previously specified
a weight of 'normal' and the font doesn't have this weight, Emacs
won't find the font spec.  In these cases, replacing ":weight 'normal"
with ":weight 'medium" should fix the issue.

---
** Keymap descriptions have changed.
'help--describe-command', 'C-h b' and associated functions that output
keymap descriptions have changed.  In particular, prefix commands are
not output at all, and instead of "??" for closures/functions,
"[closure]"/"[lambda]" is output.

---
** 'downcase' details have changed slightly.
In certain locales, changing the case of an ASCII-range character may
turn it into a multibyte character, most notably with "I" in Turkish
(the lowercase is "ı", 0x0131).  Previously, 'downcase' on a unibyte
string was buggy, and would mistakenly just return the lower byte of
this, 0x31 (the digit "1").  'downcase' on a unibyte string has now
been changed to downcase such characters as if they were ASCII.  To
get proper locale-dependent downcasing, the string has to be converted
to multibyte first.  (This goes for the other case-changing functions,
too.)

---
** Functions in 'tramp-foreign-file-name-handler-alist' have changed.
Functions to determine which Tramp file name handler to use are now
passed a file name in dissected form (via 'tramp-dissect-file-name')
instead of in string form.

---
** 'def' indentation changes.
In 'emacs-lisp-mode', forms with a symbol with a name that start with
"def" have been automatically indented as if they were 'defun'-like
forms, for instance:

    (defzot 1
      2 3)

This heuristic has now been removed, and all functions/macros that
want to be indented this way have to be marked with

    (declare (indent defun))

or the like.  If the function/macro definition itself can't be
changed, the indentation can also be adjusted by saying something
like:

    (put 'defzot 'lisp-indent-function 'defun)

---
** The 'inhibit-changing-match-data' variable is now obsolete.
Instead, functions like 'string-match' and 'looking-at' now take an
optional INHIBIT-MODIFY argument.

---
** 'gnus-define-keys' is now obsolete.
Use 'define-keymap' instead.

---
** MozRepl has been removed from js.el.
MozRepl was removed from Firefox in 2017, so this code doesn't work
with recent versions of Firefox.

---
** The function 'image-dired-get-exif-data' is now obsolete.
Use 'exif-parse-file' and 'exif-field' instead.

---
** 'insert-directory' alternatives should not change the free disk space line.
This change is now applied in 'dired-insert-directory'.

---
** 'compilation-last-buffer' is (finally) declared obsolete.
It's been obsolete since Emacs-22.1, actually.

---
** Calling 'lsh' now elicits a byte-compiler warning.
'lsh' behaves in somewhat surprising and platform-dependent ways for
negative arguments, and is generally slower than 'ash', which should be
used instead.  This warning can be suppressed by surrounding calls to
'lsh' with the construct '(with-suppressed-warnings ((suspicious lsh)) ...)',
but switching to `ash` is generally much preferable.

---
** Some functions and variables obsolete since Emacs 24 have been removed:
'Info-edit-map', 'allout-abbreviate-flattened-numbering',
'allout-mode-deactivate-hook', 'ansi-color-unfontify-region',
'auth-source-forget-user-or-password', 'auth-source-hide-passwords',

---
** Some functions and variables obsolete since Emacs 23 have been removed:
'find-emacs-lisp-shadows', 'newsticker-cache-filename',
'process-filter-multibyte-p', 'redisplay-end-trigger-functions',
'set-process-filter-multibyte', 'set-window-redisplay-end-trigger',
'unify-8859-on-decoding-mode', 'unify-8859-on-encoding-mode',
'vc-arch-command', 'window-redisplay-end-trigger', 'x-selection'.

---
** Some functions and variables obsolete since Emacs 21 or 22 have been removed:
'c-toggle-auto-state', 'find-file-not-found-hooks',
'ls-lisp-dired-ignore-case', 'query-replace-regexp-eval'.

+++
** New generic function 'function-documentation'.
Can dynamically generate a raw docstring depending on the type of
a function.
Used mainly for docstrings of OClosures.

+++
** Base64 encoding no longer tolerates latin-1 input.
The functions 'base64-encode-string', 'base64url-encode-string',
'base64-encode-region' and 'base64url-encode-region' no longer accept
characters in the range U+0080..U+00FF as substitutes for single bytes
in the range 128..255, but signal an error for all multibyte characters.
The input must be encoded text.

+++
** The 'clone-indirect-buffer-hook' is now run by 'make-indirect-buffer'.
It was previously only run by 'clone-indirect-buffer' and
'clone-indirect-buffer-other-window'.  Since 'make-indirect-buffer' is
called by both of these, the hook is now run by all 3 of these
functions.

---
** '?\' at the end of a line now signals an error.
Previously it produced a nonsense value, -1, that was never intended.

---
** Some libraries obsolete since Emacs 24.1 and 24.3 have been removed:
abbrevlist.el, assoc.el, complete.el, cust-print.el,
erc-hecomplete.el, mailpost.el, mouse-sel.el, old-emacs-lock.el,
patcomp.el, pc-mode.el, pc-select.el, s-region.el, and sregex.el.

+++
** Many seldom-used generalized variables have been made obsolete.
Emacs has a number of rather obscure generalized variables defined,
that, for instance, allowed you to say things like:

   (setf (point-min) 4)

These never caught on and have been made obsolete.  The form above,
for instance, is the same as saying

   (narrow-to-region 4 (point-max))

The following generalized variables have been made obsolete:
'buffer-file-name', 'buffer-local-value', 'buffer-modified-p',
'buffer-name', 'buffer-string', 'buffer-substring', 'current-buffer',
'current-column', 'current-global-map', 'current-input-mode',
'current-local-map', 'current-window-configuration',
'default-file-modes', 'documentation-property', 'frame-height',
'frame-width', 'frame-visible-p', 'global-key-binding',
'local-key-binding', 'mark', 'mark-marker', 'marker-position',
'mouse-position', 'point', 'point-marker', 'point-max', 'point-min',
'read-mouse-position', 'screen-height', 'screen-width',
'selected-frame', 'selected-screen', 'selected-window',
'standard-case-table', 'syntax-table', 'visited-file-modtime',
'window-height', 'window-width', and 'x-get-secondary-selection'.


* Lisp Changes in Emacs 29.1

+++
** New function 'make-obsolete-generalized-variable'.
This can be used to mark setters used by 'setf' as obsolete, and the
byte-compiler will then warn about using them.

+++
** New functions 'pos-eol' and 'pos-bol'.
These are like 'line-end-position' and 'line-beginning-position'
(respectively), but ignore fields (and are more efficient).

+++
** New function 'compiled-function-p'.
This returns non-nil if its argument is either a built-in, or a
byte-compiled, or a natively-compiled function object, or a function
loaded from a dynamic module.

---
** 'deactivate-mark' can have new value 'dont-save'.
This value means that Emacs should deactivate the mark as usual, but
without setting the primary selection, if 'select-active-regions' is
enabled.

+++
** New 'declare' form 'interactive-args'.
This can be used to specify what forms to put into 'command-history'
when executing commands interactively.

+++
** The FORM arg of 'time-convert' is mandatory.
'time-convert' can still be called without it, as before, but the
compiler now emits a warning about this deprecated usage.

+++
** Emacs now supports user-customizable and themable icons.
These can be used for buttons in buffers and the like.  See the
"(elisp) Icons" and "(emacs) Icons" nodes in the manuals for details.

+++
** New function 'seq-positions'.
This returns a list of the (zero-based) indices of elements matching a
given predicate in the specified sequence.

+++
** New arguments MESSAGE and TIMEOUT of 'set-transient-map'.
MESSAGE specifies a message to display after activating the transient
map, including a special formatting spec to list available keys.
TIMEOUT is the idle time after which to deactivate the transient map.
The default timeout value can be defined by the new variable
'set-transient-map-timeout'.

+++
** New function 'seq-split'.
This returns a list of sub-sequences of the specified sequence.

+++
** New function 'seq-remove-at-position'.
This function returns a copy of the specified sequence where the
element at a given (zero-based) index got removed.

+++
** 'plist-get', 'plist-put' and 'plist-member' are no longer limited to 'eq'.
These function now take an optional comparison predicate argument.

+++
** 'read-multiple-choice' can now use long-form answers.

+++
** 'M-c' in 'read-regexp' now toggles case folding.

+++
** 'completing-read' now allows a function as its REQUIRE-MATCH argument.
This function is called to see whether what the user has typed in is a
match.  This is also available from functions that call
'completing-read', like 'read-file-name'.

+++
** 'posn-col-row' can now give position data based on windows.
Previously, it reported data only based on the frame.

+++
** 'file-expand-wildcards' can now also take a regexp as PATTERN argument.

---
** vc-mtn (the backend for Monotone) has been made obsolete.

+++
** 'gui-set-selection' can now specify different values for different data types.
If DATA is a string, then its text properties are searched for values
for each specific data type while the selection is being converted.

---
** New eldoc function 'elisp-eldoc-var-docstring-with-value'.
This function includes the current value of the variable in eldoc display
and can be used as a more detailed alternative to 'elisp-eldoc-var-docstring'.

+++
** 'save-some-buffers' can now be extended to save other things.
Traditionally, 'save-some-buffers' saved buffers, and also saved
abbrevs.  This has been generalized via the
'save-some-buffers-functions' variable, and packages can now register
things to be saved.

+++
** New function 'string-equal-ignore-case'.
This compares strings ignoring case differences.

** 'symbol-file' can now report natively-compiled ".eln" files.
If Emacs was built with native-compilation enabled, Lisp programs can
now call 'symbol-file' with the new optional 3rd argument non-nil to
request the name of the ".eln" file which defined a given symbol.

+++
** New macro 'with-memoization' provides a very primitive form of memoization.

+++
** 'max-char' can now report the maximum codepoint according to Unicode.
When called with a new optional argument UNICODE non-nil, 'max-char'
will now report the maximum valid codepoint defined by the Unicode
Standard.

** Themes

---
*** New hooks 'enable-theme-functions' and 'disable-theme-functions'.
These are run after enabling and disabling a theme, respectively.

---
*** Themes can now be made obsolete.
Using 'make-obsolete' on a theme is now supported.  This will make
'load-theme' issue a warning when loading the theme.

+++
** New hook 'display-monitors-changed-functions'.
It is called whenever the configuration of different monitors on a
display changes.

+++
** 'prin1' and 'prin1-to-string' now take an optional OVERRIDES parameter.
This parameter can be used to override values of print-related settings.

+++
** New minor mode 'header-line-indent-mode'.
This is meant to be used in modes that have a header line that should
be kept aligned with the buffer contents when the user switches
'display-line-numbers-mode' on or off.

+++
** New minor mode 'lost-selection-mode'.
This minor mode makes Emacs deactivate the mark in all buffers when
the primary selection is obtained by another program.

---
** On X, Emacs will try to preserve selection ownership when a frame is deleted.
This means that if you make Emacs the owner of a selection, such as by
selecting some text into the clipboard or primary selection, and then
delete the current frame, you will still be able to insert the
contents of that selection into other programs as long as another
frame is open on the same display.  This behavior can be disabled by
setting the user option 'x-auto-preserve-selections' to nil.

+++
** New predicate 'char-uppercase-p'.
This returns non-nil if its argument its an uppercase character.

** Byte compilation

---
*** Byte compilation will now warn about some quoting mistakes in docstrings.
When writing code snippets that contains the "'" character (APOSTROPHE),
that quote character has to be escaped to avoid Emacs displaying it as
"’" (LEFT SINGLE QUOTATION MARK), which would make code examples like

    (setq foo '(1 2 3))

invalid.  Emacs will now warn during byte compilation if it seems
something like that, and also warn about when using RIGHT/LEFT SINGLE
QUOTATION MARK directly.  In both these cases, if these characters
should really be present in the docstring, they should be quoted with
"\=".

---
*** Byte compilation will now warn about some malformed 'defcustom' types.
It's very common to write 'defcustom' types on the form:

    :type '(choice (const :tag "foo" 'bar))

I.e., double-quoting the 'bar', which is almost never the correct
value.  The byte compiler will now issue a warning if it encounters
these forms.

+++
** 'restore-buffer-modified-p' can now alter buffer auto-save state.
With a FLAG value of 'autosaved', it will mark the buffer as having
been auto-saved since the time of last modification.

---
** New minor mode 'isearch-fold-quotes-mode'.
This sets up 'search-default-mode' so that quote characters are
char-folded into each other.  It is used, by default, in "*Help*" and
"*info*" buffers.

+++
** New macro 'buffer-local-set-state'.
This is a helper macro to be used by minor modes that wish to restore
buffer-local variables back to their original states when the mode is
switched off.

---
** New macro 'with-buffer-unmodified-if-unchanged'.
If the buffer is marked as unmodified, and code does modifications
that, in total, means that the buffer is identical to the buffer
before, mark the buffer as unmodified again.

---
** New function 'malloc-trim'.
This function allows returning unused memory back to the operating
system, and is mainly meant as a debugging tool.  It is currently
available only when Emacs was built with glibc as the C library.

---
** 'x-show-tip' no longer hard-codes a timeout default.
The new 'x-show-tooltip-timeout' variable allows the user to alter
this for packages that don't use 'tooltip-show', but instead call the
lower level function directly.

---
** New function 'current-cpu-time'.
It gives access to the CPU time used by the Emacs process, for
example for benchmarking purposes.

---
** New function 'string-edit'.
This is meant to be used when the user has to edit a (potentially)
long string.  It pops you to a new buffer where you can edit the
string, and a callback is called when the user types 'C-c C-c'.

+++
** New function 'read-string-from-buffer'.
This is a modal version of 'string-edit', and can be used as an
alternative to 'read-string'.

+++
** The return value of 'clear-message-function' is not ignored anymore.
If the function returns 'dont-clear-message', then the message is not
cleared, with the assumption that the function cleared it itself.

+++
** The local variable section now supports defining fallback modes.
This was previously only available when using a property line (i.e.,
putting the modes on the first line of a file).

+++
** New function 'flush-standard-output'.
This enables you to display incomplete lines from batch-based Emacs
scripts.

+++
** New convenience function 'buttonize-region'.
This works like 'buttonize', but for a region instead of a string.

+++
** 'macroexp-let2*' can omit TEST arg and use single-var bindings.

+++
** New macro-writing macros, 'cl-with-gensyms' and 'cl-once-only'.
See the "(cl) Macro-Writing Macros" manual section for descriptions.

+++
** New variable 'last-event-device' and new function 'device-class'.
On X Windows, 'last-event-device' specifies the input extension device
from which the last input event originated, and 'device-class' can be
used to determine the type of an input device.

+++
** 'track-mouse' can be a new value 'drag-source'.
This means the same as 'dropping', but modifies the mouse position
list in reported motion events if there is no frame underneath the
mouse pointer.

+++
** New functions for dragging items from Emacs to other programs.
The new functions 'x-begin-drag', 'dnd-begin-file-drag',
'dnd-begin-drag-files', and 'dnd-direct-save' allow dragging contents
(such as files and text) from Emacs to other programs.

---
** New function 'ietf-drums-parse-date-string'.
This function parses RFC5322 (and RFC822) date strings, and should be
used instead of 'parse-time-string' when parsing data that's standards
compliant.

+++
** New macro 'setopt'.
This is like 'setq', but is meant to be used for user options instead
of plain variables, and
uses 'custom-set'/'set-default' to set them.

+++
** New utility predicate 'mode-line-window-selected-p'.
This is meant to be used from ':eval' mode line constructs to create
different mode line looks for selected and unselected windows.

+++
** New variable 'messages-buffer-name'.
This variable (defaulting to "*Messages*") allows packages to override
where messages are logged.

+++
** New function 'readablep'.
This function says whether an object can be written out and then
read back by the Emacs Lisp reader.

+++
** New variable 'print-unreadable-function'.
This variable allows changing how Emacs prints unreadable objects.

---
** The user option 'polling-period' now accepts floating point values.
This means Emacs can now poll for input during Lisp execution more
frequently than once in a second.

---
** New function 'bidi-string-strip-control-characters'.
This utility function is meant for displaying strings when it's
essential that there's no bidirectional context.

---
** The Gnus range functions have been moved to a new library, range.el.
All the old names have been made obsolete.

+++
** New function 'function-alias-p'.
This predicate says whether an object is a function alias, and if it
is, the alias chain is returned.

+++
** New variable 'lisp-directory' holds the directory of Emacs's own Lisp files.

+++
** New facility for handling session state: 'multisession-value'.
This can be used as a convenient way to store (simple) application
state, and the command 'list-multisession-values' allows users to list
(and edit) this data.

+++
** New function 'get-display-property'.
This is like 'get-text-property', but works on the 'display' text
property.

+++
** New function 'add-display-text-property'.
This is like 'put-text-property', but works on the 'display' text
property.

+++
** New 'min-width' 'display' property.
This allows setting a minimum display width for a region of text.

+++
** New 'cursor-face' text property.
This uses 'cursor-face' instead of the default face when cursor is on or
near the character and 'cursor-face-highlight-mode' is enabled.  The
user option 'cursor-face-highlight-nonselected-window' is similar to
'highlight-nonselected-windows', but for this property.

+++
** New event type 'touch-end'.
This event is sent whenever the user's finger moves off the mouse
wheel on some mice, or when the user's finger moves off the touchpad.

+++
** New event type 'pinch'.
This event is sent when a user performs a pinch gesture on a touchpad,
which is comprised of placing two fingers on the touchpad and moving
them towards or away from each other.

+++
** New hook 'x-pre-popup-menu-hook'.
This hook is run before 'x-popup-menu' is about to display a
deck-of-cards menu on screen.

---
** New hook 'post-select-region-hook'.
This hook is run immediately after 'select-active-regions' causes the
region to be set as the primary selection.

+++
** New function 'buffer-match-p'.
Check if a buffer satisfies some condition.  Some examples for
conditions can be regular expressions that match a buffer name, a
cons-cell like '(major-mode . shell-mode)' that matches any buffer
where 'major-mode' is 'shell-mode' or a combined with a condition like
'(and "\\`\\*.+\\*\\'" (major-mode . special-mode))'.

+++
** New function 'match-buffers'.
Use 'buffer-match-p' to gather a list of buffers that match a
condition.

---
** New optional arguments 'text-face' and 'default-face' for 'tooltip-show'.
They allow changing the faces used for the tooltip text and frame
colors of the resulting tooltip frame from the default 'tooltip' face.

** Text security and suspiciousness

+++
*** New library textsec.el.
This library contains a number of checks for whether a string is
"suspicious".  This usually means that the string contains characters
that have glyphs that can be confused with other, more commonly used
glyphs, or contain bidirectional (or other) formatting characters that
may be used to confuse a user.

+++
*** New user option 'textsec-check'.
If non-nil (which is the default), Emacs packages that are vulnerable
to attackers trying to confuse the users will use the textsec library
to mark suspicious text.  For instance shr/eww will mark suspicious
URLs and links, Gnus will mark suspicious From addresses, and
Message mode will query the user if the user is sending mail to a
suspicious address.  If this variable is nil, these checks aren't
performed.

+++
*** New function 'textsec-suspicious-p'.
This is the main function Emacs applications should be using to check
whether a string is suspicious.  It heeds the 'textsec-check' user
option.

** Keymaps and key definitions

+++
*** 'where-is-internal' can now filter events marked as non key events.
If a command maps to a key binding like '[some-event]', and 'some-event'
has a symbol plist containing a non-nil 'non-key-event' property, then
that binding is ignored by 'where-is-internal'.

+++
*** New functions for defining and manipulating keystrokes.
These all take the syntax defined by 'key-valid-p'.  None of the older
functions have been deprecated or altered, but they are now
de-emphasized in the documentation.

+++
*** Use 'keymap-set' instead of 'define-key'.

+++
*** Use 'keymap-global-set' instead of 'global-set-key'.

+++
*** Use 'keymap-local-set' instead of 'local-set-key'.

+++
*** Use 'keymap-global-unset' instead of 'global-unset-key'.

+++
*** Use 'keymap-local-unset' instead of 'local-unset-key'.

+++
*** Use 'keymap-substitute' instead of 'substitute-key-definition'.

+++
*** Use 'keymap-set-after' instead of 'define-key-after'.

+++
*** Use 'keymap-lookup' instead of 'lookup-keymap' and 'key-binding'.

+++
*** Use 'keymap-local-lookup' instead of 'local-key-binding'.

+++
*** Use 'keymap-global-lookup' instead of 'global-key-binding'.

+++
*** 'define-key' now takes an optional REMOVE argument.
If non-nil, remove the definition from the keymap.  This is subtly
different from setting a definition to nil (when the keymap has a
parent).

+++
*** 'read-multiple-choice' now takes an optional SHOW-HELP argument.
If non-nil, show the help buffer immediately, before any user input.

+++
*** New function 'key-valid-p'.
The 'kbd' function is quite permissive, and will try to return
something usable even if the syntax of the argument isn't completely
correct.  The 'key-valid-p' predicate does a stricter check of the
syntax.

---
*** New function 'key-parse'.
This is like 'kbd', but only returns vectors instead of a mix of
vectors and strings.

+++
*** New ':type' for 'defcustom' for keys.
The new 'key' type can be used for options that should be a valid key
according to 'key-valid-p'.  The type 'key-sequence' is now obsolete.

+++
** New substitution in docstrings and 'substitute-command-keys'.
Use \\`KEYSEQ' to insert a literal key sequence "KEYSEQ" (for example
\\`C-k') in a docstring or when calling 'substitute-command-keys',
which will use the same face as a command substitution.  This should
be used only when a key sequence has no corresponding command, for
example when it is read directly with 'read-key-sequence'.  It must be
a valid key sequence according to 'key-valid-p'.

+++
** New function 'file-name-split'.
This returns a list of all the components of a file name.

+++
** New macro 'with-undo-amalgamate'.
It records a particular sequence of operations as a single undo step.

+++
** New command 'yank-media'.
This command supports yanking non-plain-text media like images and
HTML from other applications into Emacs.  It is only supported in
modes that have registered support for it, and only on capable
platforms.

+++
** New command 'yank-media-types'.
This command lets you examine all data in the current selection and
the clipboard, and insert it into the buffer.

+++
** New variable 'yank-transform-functions'.
This variable allows the user to alter the string to be inserted.

---
** New command 'yank-in-context'.
This command tries to preserve string/comment syntax when yanking.

---
** New function 'minibuffer-lazy-highlight-setup'.
This function allows setting up the minibuffer so that lazy
highlighting of its content is applied in the original window.

+++
** New text property 'inhibit-isearch'.
If set, 'isearch' will skip these areas, which can be useful (for
instance) when covering huge amounts of data (that has no meaningful
searchable data, like image data) with a 'display' text property.

+++
** 'insert-image' now takes an INHIBIT-ISEARCH optional parameter.
It marks the image with the 'inhibit-isearch' text property, which
inhibits 'isearch' matching the STRING parameter.

---
** New variable 'replace-regexp-function'.
Function to call to convert the entered FROM string to an Emacs
regexp in 'query-replace' and similar commands.  It can be used to
implement a different regexp syntax for search/replace.

---
** New variables to customize defaults of FROM for 'query-replace*' commands.
The new variable 'query-replace-read-from-default' can be set to a
function that returns the default value of FROM when 'query-replace'
prompts for a string to be replaced.  An example of such a function is
'find-tag-default'.

The new variable 'query-replace-read-from-regexp-default' can be set
to a function (such as 'find-tag-default-as-regexp') that returns the
default value of FROM when 'query-replace-regexp' prompts for a regexp
whose matches are to be replaced.  If these variables are nil (which
is the default), 'query-replace' and 'query-replace-regexp' take the
default value from the previous FROM-TO pair.

---
** New user option 'pp-use-max-width'.
If non-nil, 'pp' will attempt to limit the line length when formatting
long lists and vectors.

---
** New function 'pp-emacs-lisp-code'.
'pp' formats general Lisp sexps.  This function does much the same,
but applies formatting rules appropriate for Emacs Lisp code.

+++
** New function 'file-has-changed-p'.
This convenience function is useful when writing code that parses
files at run-time, and allows Lisp programs to re-parse files only
when they have changed.

+++
** 'abbreviate-file-name' now respects magic file name handlers.

---
** New function 'font-has-char-p'.
This can be used to check whether a specific font has a glyph for a
character.

+++
** 'window-text-pixel-size' now accepts a new argument IGNORE-LINE-AT-END.
This controls whether or not the last screen line of the text being
measured will be counted for the purpose of calculating the text
dimensions.

+++
** 'window-text-pixel-size' understands a new meaning of FROM.
Specifying a cons as the FROM argument allows to start measuring text
from a specified amount of pixels above or below a position.

+++
** 'window-body-width' and 'window-body-height' can use remapped faces.
Specifying 'remap' as the PIXELWISE argument now checks if the default
face was remapped, and if so, uses the remapped face to determine the
character width/height.

+++
** 'set-window-vscroll' now accepts a new argument PRESERVE-VSCROLL-P.
This means the vscroll will not be reset when set on a window that is
"frozen" due to a mini-window being resized.

** XDG support

---
*** New function 'xdg-state-home' returns 'XDG_STATE_HOME' environment variable.
This new location, introduced in the XDG Base Directory Specification
version 0.8 (8th May 2021), "contains state data that should persist
between (application) restarts, but that is not important or portable
enough to the user that it should be stored in $XDG_DATA_HOME".

+++
** New macro 'with-delayed-message'.
This macro is like 'progn', but will output the specified message if
the body takes longer to execute than the specified timeout.

---
** New function 'funcall-with-delayed-message'.
This function is like 'funcall', but will output the specified message
if the function takes longer to execute than the specified timeout.

** Locale

---
*** New variable 'current-locale-environment'.
This holds the value of the previous call to 'set-locale-environment'.

---
*** New macro 'with-locale-environment'.
This macro can be used to change the locale temporarily while
executing code.

** table.el

---
*** New user option 'table-latex-environment'.
This allows switching between "table" and "tabular".

** Tabulated List Mode

+++
*** A column can now be set to an image descriptor.
The 'tabulated-list-entries' variable now supports using an image
descriptor, which means to insert an image in that column instead of
text.  See the documentation string of that variable for details.

+++
** ':keys' in 'menu-item' can now be a function.
If so, it is called whenever the menu is computed, and can be used to
calculate the keys dynamically.

+++
** New major mode 'clean-mode'.
This is a new major mode meant for debugging.  It kills absolutely all
local variables and removes overlays and text properties.

+++
** 'kill-all-local-variables' can now kill all local variables.
If given the new optional KILL-PERMANENT argument, also kill permanent
local variables.

+++
** Third 'mapconcat' argument SEPARATOR is now optional.
An explicit nil always meant the empty string, now it can be left out.

+++
** New function 'define-keymap'.
This function allows defining a number of keystrokes with one form.

+++
** New macro 'defvar-keymap'.
This macro allows defining keymap variables more conveniently.

---
** 'kbd' can now be used in built-in, preloaded libraries.
It no longer depends on edmacro.el and cl-lib.el.

+++
** New function 'image-at-point-p'.
This function returns t if point is on a valid image, and nil
otherwise.

+++
** New function 'string-pixel-width'.
This returns the width of a string in pixels.  This can be useful when
dealing with variable pitch fonts and glyphs that have widths that
aren't integer multiples of the default font.

+++
** New function 'string-glyph-split'.
This function splits a string into a list of strings representing
separate glyphs.  This takes into account combining characters and
grapheme clusters.

---
** 'lookup-key' is more permissive when searching for extended menu items.
In Emacs 28.1, the behavior of 'lookup-key' was changed: when looking
for a menu item '[menu-bar Foo-Bar]', first try to find an exact
match, then look for the lowercased '[menu-bar foo-bar]'.

This has been extended, so that when looking for a menu item with a
symbol containing spaces, as in '[menu-bar Foo\ Bar]', first look for
an exact match, then the lowercased '[menu-bar foo\ bar]' and finally
'[menu-bar foo-bar]'.  This further improves backwards-compatibility
when converting menus to use 'easy-menu-define'.

** xwidgets

+++
*** The function 'make-xwidget' now accepts an optional RELATED argument.
This argument is used as another widget for the newly created WebKit
widget to share settings and subprocesses with.  It must be another
WebKit widget.

+++
*** New function 'xwidget-perform-lispy-event'.
This function allows you to send events to xwidgets.  Usually, some
equivalent of the event will be sent, but there is no guarantee of
what the widget will actually receive.

On GTK+, only key and function key events are implemented.

+++
*** New function 'xwidget-webkit-load-html'.
This function is used to load HTML text into WebKit xwidgets
directly, in contrast to creating a temporary file to hold the
markup, and passing the URI of the file as an argument to
'xwidget-webkit-goto-uri'.

+++
*** New functions for performing searches on WebKit xwidgets.
Some new functions, such as 'xwidget-webkit-search', have been added
for performing searches on WebKit xwidgets.

+++
*** New function 'xwidget-webkit-back-forward-list'.
This function returns the history of page-loads in a WebKit xwidget.

+++
*** New function 'xwidget-webkit-estimated-load-progress'.
This function returns the estimated progress of page loading in a
WebKit xwidget.

+++
*** New function 'xwidget-webkit-stop-loading'.
This function terminates all data transfer during page loads in a
WebKit xwidget.

+++
*** 'load-changed' xwidget events are now more detailed.
In particular, they can now have different arguments based on the
state of the WebKit widget.  'load-finished' is sent when a load has
completed, 'load-started' when a load first starts, 'load-redirected'
after a redirect, and 'load-committed' when the WebKit widget first
commits to the load.

+++
*** New event type 'xwidget-display-event'.
These events are sent whenever an xwidget requests that Emacs display
another xwidget.  The only arguments to this event are the xwidget
that should be displayed, and the xwidget that asked to display it.

+++
*** New function 'xwidget-webkit-set-cookie-storage-file'.
This function is used to control where and if an xwidget stores
cookies set by web pages on disk.

---
** New variable 'help-buffer-under-preparation'.
This variable is bound to t during the preparation of a "*Help*" buffer.

+++
** Timestamps like '(1 . 1000)' now work without warnings being generated.
For example, '(time-add nil '(1 . 1000))' no longer warns that the
'(1 . 1000)' acts like '(1000 . 1000000)'.  This warning, which was a
temporary transition aid for Emacs 27, has served its purpose.

+++
** 'encode-time' now also accepts a 6-element list with just time and date.
'(encode-time (list SECOND MINUTE HOUR DAY MONTH YEAR))' is now short for
'(encode-time (list SECOND MINUTE HOUR DAY MONTH YEAR nil -1 nil))'.

+++
** 'date-to-time' now assumes earliest values if its argument lacks
month, day, or time.  For example, (date-to-time "2021-12-04") now
assumes a time of 00:00 instead of signaling an error.

+++
** 'format-seconds' now allows suppressing zero-value trailing elements.
The new "%x" non-printing control character will suppress zero-value
elements that appear after "%x".

+++
** New events for taking advantage of touchscreen devices.
The events 'touchscreen-begin, 'touchscreen-update', and
'touchscreen-end' have been added to take better advantage of
touch-capable display panels.

+++
** New error symbol 'permission-denied'.
This is a subcategory of 'file-error', and is signaled when some file
operation fails because the OS doesn't allow Emacs to access a file or
a directory.

+++
** The ':underline' face attribute now accepts a new property.
The property ':position' now specifies the position of the underline
when used as part of a property list specification for the
':underline' attribute.

+++
** 'defalias' records a more precise history of definitions.
This is recorded in the 'function-history' symbol property.

---
** New hook 'save-place-after-find-file-hook'.
This is called at the end of 'save-place-find-file-hook'.

---
** 'indian-tml-base-table' no longer translates digits.
Use 'indian-tml-base-digits-table' if you want digits translation.

---
** 'indian-tml-itrans-v5-hash' no longer translates digits.
Use 'indian-tml-itrans-digits-v5-hash' if you want digits
translation.

+++
** 'shell-quote-argument' has a new optional parameter POSIX.
This is useful when quoting shell arguments for a remote shell
invocation.  Such shells are POSIX conformant by default.

+++
** 'make-process' can set connection type independently for input and output.
When calling 'make-process', communication via pty can be enabled
selectively for just input or output by passing a cons cell for
':connection-type', e.g. '(pipe . pty)'.  When examining a process
later, you can determine whether a particular stream for a process
uses a pty by passing one of 'stdin', 'stdout', or 'stderr' as the
second argument to 'process-tty-name'.

+++
** 'signal-process' now consults the list 'signal-process-functions'.
This is to determine which function has to be called in order to
deliver the signal.  This allows Tramp to send the signal to remote
asynchronous processes.  The hitherto existing implementation has been
moved to 'internal-default-signal-process'.

+++
** 'list-system-processes' now returns remote process IDs.
This happens only when the current buffer's 'default-directory' is
remote.  In order to preserve the old behavior, apply

    (let ((default-directory temporary-file-directory))
      (list-system-processes))

+++
** 'process-attributes' expects a remote process ID now.
When current buffer's 'default-directory' is remote, the PID argument
of 'process-attributes' is regarded as a remote process ID.  In order
to preserve the old behavior, apply

    (let ((default-directory temporary-file-directory))
      (process-attributes pid))

+++
** New functions 'take' and 'ntake'.
'(take N LIST)' returns the first N elements of LIST; 'ntake' does
the same but works by modifying LIST destructively.



* Changes in Emacs 29.1 on Non-Free Operating Systems

** MS-Windows

---
*** Emacs now supports double-buffering on MS-Windows to reduce display flicker.
(This was supported on Free systems since Emacs 26.1.)

To disable double-buffering (e.g., if it causes display problems), set
the frame parameter 'inhibit-double-buffering' to a non-nil value.
You can do that either by adding

    '(inhibit-double-buffering . t)

to 'default-frame-alist', or by modifying the frame parameters of the
selected frame by evaluating

    (modify-frame-parameters nil '((inhibit-double-buffering . t)))

+++
*** Emacs now supports system dark mode.
On Windows 10 (version 1809 and higher) and Windows 11, Emacs will now
follow the system's dark mode: GUI frames use the appropriate light or
dark title bar and scroll bars, based on the user's Windows-wide color
settings.

---
*** Emacs now uses native image APIs to display some image formats.
On Windows 2000 and later, Emacs now defaults to using the native
image APIs for displaying the BMP, GIF, JPEG, PNG, and TIFF images.
This means Emacs on MS-Windows needs no longer use external image
support libraries to display those images.  Other image types -- XPM,
SVG, and WEBP -- still need support libraries for Emacs to be able to
display them.

The use of native image APIs is controlled by the variable
'w32-use-native-image-API', whose value now defaults to t on systems
where those APIs are available.

+++
*** Emacs now supports display of BMP images using native image APIs.
When 'w32-use-native-image-API' is non-nil, Emacs on MS-Windows now
has built-in support for displaying BMP images.

** Cygwin

---
*** 'process-attributes' is now implemented.
