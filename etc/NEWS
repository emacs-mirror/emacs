* Installation Changes in Emacs 28.1

--
** Support for building with Motif has been removed.

** Cairo graphics library is now used by default if found.
'--with-cairo' is now the default, if the appropriate development files
are found by 'configure'.  Note that building with Cairo means using
Pango instead of libXFT for font support.  Since Pango 1.44 has
removed support for bitmapped fonts, this may require you to adjust
your font settings.

Note also that 'FontBackend' settings in ".Xdefaults" or
".Xresources", or 'font-backend' frame parameter settings in your init
files, may need to be adjusted, as 'xft' is no longer a valid backend
when using Cairo.  Use 'ftcrhb' if your Emacs was built with HarfBuzz
text shaping support, and 'ftcr' otherwise.  You can determine this by
checking 'system-configuration-features'.  The 'ftcr' backend will
still be available when HarfBuzz is supported, but will not be used by
default.  We strongly recommend building with HarBuzz support.  'x' is
still a valid backend.

---
** Building without double buffering support.
'configure --with-xdbe=no' can now be used to disable double buffering
at build time.

---
** 'configure' now warns about building with libXft support.
libXft is unmaintained, and causes a number of problems with modern
fonts including but not limited to crashes; support for it may be
removed in a future version of Emacs.  Please consider using
Cairo + HarfBuzz instead.

---
** 'configure' now warns about not using HarfBuzz if using Cairo.
We want to encourage people to use the most modern font features
available, and this is the Cairo graphics library + HarfBuzz for font
shaping, so 'configure' now recommends that combination.

---
** The ftx font backend driver has been removed.
It was declared obsolete in Emacs 27.1.

---
** Support for building with '-fcheck-pointer-bounds' has been removed.
GCC has withdrawn the '-fcheck-pointer-bounds' option and support for
its implementation has been removed from the Linux kernel.

---
** Emacs no longer supports old OpenBSD systems.
OpenBSD 5.3 and older releases are no longer supported, as they lack
proper pty support that Emacs needs.


* Startup Changes in Emacs 28.1

** Emacs can support 24-bit color TTY without terminfo database.
If your text-mode terminal supports 24-bit true color, but your system
lacks the terminfo database, you can instruct Emacs to support 24-bit
true color by setting 'COLORTERM=truecolor' in the environment.  This is
useful on systems such as FreeBSD which ships only with "etc/termcap".


* Changes in Emacs 28.1

** The new NonGNU ELPA archive is enabled by default alongside GNU ELPA.

+++
** New command 'recenter-other-window', bound to 'S-M-C-l'.
Like 'recenter-top-bottom' acting in the other window.

** Minibuffer scrolling is now conservative by default.
This is controlled by the new variable 'scroll-minibuffer-conservatively'.

In addition, there is a new variable
'redisplay-adhoc-scroll-in-resize-mini-windows' to disable the
ad-hoc auto-scrolling when resizing minibuffer windows.  It has been
found that its heuristic can be counter productive in some corner
cases, tho the cure may be worse than the disease.  This said, the
effect should be negligible in the vast majority of cases anyway.

+++
** Improved handling of minibuffers on switching frames.
By default, when you switch to another frame, an active minibuffer now
moves to the newly selected frame.  Nevertheless, the effect of what
you type in the minibuffer happens in the frame where the minibuffer
was first activated.  An alternative behavior is available by
customizing 'minibuffer-follows-selected-frame' to nil.  Here, the
minibuffer stays in the frame where you first opened it, and you must
switch back to this frame to continue or abort its command.  The old
behavior, which mixed these two, can be approximated by customizing
'minibuffer-follows-selected-frame' to a value which is neither nil
nor t.

+++
** New system for displaying documentation for groups of functions.
This can either be used by saying 'M-x shortdoc-display-group' and
choosing a group, or clicking a button in the "*Help*" buffers when
looking at the doc string of a function that belongs to one of these
groups.

---
** Improved "find definition" feature of *Help* buffers.
Now clicking on the link to find the definition of functions generated
by 'cl-defstruct', or variables generated by 'define-derived-mode',
for example, will go to the exact place where they are defined.

** New variable 'redisplay-skip-initial-frame' to enable batch redisplay tests.
Setting it to nil forces the redisplay to do its job even in the
initial frame used in batch mode.

---
** Support for the 'strike-through' face attribute on TTY frames.
If your terminal's termcap or terminfo database entry has the 'smxx'
capability defined, Emacs will now emit the prescribed escape
sequences necessary to render faces with the 'strike-through'
attribute on TTY frames.

+++
** Emacs now defaults to UTF-8 instead of ISO-8859-1.
This is only for the default, where the user has set no 'LANG' (or
similar) variable or environment.  This change should lead to no
user-visible changes for normal usage.

+++
** New variables that hold default buffer names for shell output.
The new constants 'shell-command-buffer-name' and
'shell-command-buffer-name-async' store the default buffer names
for the output of, respectively, synchronous and async shell
commands.

** Support for '(box . SIZE)' 'cursor-type'.
By default, 'box' cursor always has a filled box shape.  But if you
specify 'cursor-type' to be '(box . SIZE)', the cursor becomes a hollow
box if the point is on an image larger than 'SIZE' pixels in any
dimension.

+++
** New user option 'word-wrap-by-category'.
When word-wrap is enabled, and this option is non-nil, that allows
Emacs to break lines after more characters than just whitespace
characters.  In particular, this significantly improves word-wrapping
for CJK text mixed with Latin text.

---
** Rudimentary support for the 'st' terminal emulator.
Emacs now supports 256 color display on the 'st' terminal emulator.

---
** Mouse wheel scrolling now works on more parts of frame's display.
When using 'mwheel-mode', the mouse wheel will now scroll also when
the mouse cursor is on the scroll bars, fringes, margins, header line,
and mode line.  ('mwheel-mode' is enabled by default on most graphical
displays.)

---
** Mouse wheel scrolling now defaults to one line at a time.

+++
** Mouse wheel scrolling with Shift modifier now scrolls horizontally.
This works in text buffers and over images.  Typing a numeric prefix arg
(e.g. 'M-5') before starting horizontal scrolling changes its step value.
The value is saved in the user option 'mouse-wheel-scroll-amount-horizontal'.

---
** The default value of 'frame-title-format' and 'icon-title-format' has changed.
These variables are used to display the title bar of visible frames
and the title bar of an iconified frame.  They now show the name of
the current buffer and the text "GNU Emacs" instead of the value of
'invocation-name'.  To get the old behavior back, add the following to
your init file:

    (setq frame-title-format '(multiple-frames "%b"
                              ("" invocation-name "@" system-name)))

+++
** 'nobreak-char-display' now also affects all non-ASCII space characters.
Previously, this was limited only to NO-BREAK-SPACE and hyphen
characters.  Now it also covers the rest of the non-ASCII Unicode
space characters.

---
** Prefer "chat.freenode.net" to "irc.freenode.net".
"chat.freenode.net" has been the preferred address for connecting to the
freenode IRC network for years now.  Occurrences of "irc.freenode.net"
have been replaced with "chat.freenode.net" throughout Emacs.

+++
** New functions 'null-device' and 'path-separator'.
These functions return the connection local value of the respective
variables.  This can be used for remote hosts.

** Emacs now prints a backtrace when signaling an error in batch mode.
This makes debugging Emacs Lisp scripts run in batch mode easier.  To
get back the old behavior, set the new variable
'backtrace-on-error-noninteractive' to a nil value.

** 'redisplay-skip-fontification-on-input' helps Emacs keep up with fast input.
This is another attempt to solve the problem of handling high key repeat rate
and other "slow scrolling" situations.  It is hoped it behaves better
than 'fast-but-imprecise-scrolling' and 'jit-lock-defer-time'.
It is not enabled by default.

+++
** Modifiers now go outside angle brackets in pretty-printed key bindings.
For example, 'RET' with Control and Meta modifiers is now shown as
'C-M-<return>' instead of '<C-M-return>'.  Either variant can be used
as input; functions such as 'kbd' and 'read-kbd-macro' accept both
styles as equivalent (they have done so for a long time).

+++
** New user option 'lazy-highlight-no-delay-length'.
Lazy highlighting of matches in Isearch now starts immediately if the
search string is at least this long.  'lazy-highlight-initial-delay'
still applies for shorter search strings, which avoids flicker in the
search buffer due to too many matches being highlighted.

+++
** A new keymap for buffer actions has been added.
The 'C-x x' keymap now holds keystrokes for various buffer-oriented
commands.  The new keystrokes are 'C-x x g' ('revert-buffer'),
'C-x x r' ('rename-buffer'), 'C-x x u' ('rename-uniquely'), 'C-x x n'
('clone-buffer'), 'C-x x i' ('insert-buffer') and 'C-x x t'
('toggle-truncate-lines').


* Editing Changes in Emacs 28.1

+++
** New command 'execute-extended-command-for-buffer'.
This new command, bound to 'M-S-x', works like
'execute-extended-command', but limits the set of commands to the
commands that have been determined to be particularly useful with the
current mode.

+++
** New user option 'read-extended-command-predicate'.
This option controls how 'M-x' performs completion of commands when
you type TAB.  By default, any command that matches what you have
typed is considered a completion candidate, but you can customize this
option to exclude commands that are not applicable to the current
buffer's major and minor modes, and respect the command's completion
predicate (if any).

---
** 'eval-expression' now no longer signals an error on incomplete expressions.
Previously, typing 'M-: ( RET' would result in Emacs saying "End of
file during parsing" and dropping out of the minibuffer.  The user
would have to type 'M-: M-p' to edit and redo the expression.  Now
Emacs will echo the message and allow the user to continue editing.

+++
** 'eval-last-sexp' now handles 'defvar'/'defcustom'/'defface' specially.
This command would previously not redefine values defined by these
forms, but this command has now been changed to work more like
'eval-defun', and reset the values as specified.

+++
** Standalone 'M-y' uses the minibuffer to complete previous kills.
When 'M-y' is typed not after a yank command, it activates the minibuffer
where you can browse previous kills using the minibuffer history or
completion.  In Isearch, you can bind 'C-s M-y' to the command
'isearch-yank-pop' that uses the minibuffer with completion on
previous kills to read a string and append it to the search string.

---
** New user options 'copy-region-blink-delay' and 'delete-pair-blink-delay'.
'copy-region-blink-delay' specifies a delay to indicate the region
copied by 'kill-ring-save'.  'delete-pair-blink-delay' specifies
a delay to show a paired character to delete.

+++
** New command 'undo-redo'.
It undoes previous undo commands, but doesn't record itself as an
undoable command.

+++
** 'read-number' now has its own history variable.
Additionally, the function now accepts a HIST argument which can be
used to specify a custom history variable.

+++
** Input history for 'goto-line' is now local to every buffer.
Each buffer will keep a separate history of line numbers used with
'goto-line'.  This should help making faster the process of finding
line numbers that were previously jumped to.

+++
** New command 'goto-line-relative' to use in a narrowed buffer.
It moves point to the line relative to the accessible portion of the
narrowed buffer.  'M-g M-g' in Info is rebound to this command.
When 'widen-automatically' is non-nil, 'goto-line' widens the narrowed
buffer to be able to move point to the inaccessible portion.
'goto-line-relative' is bound to 'C-x n g'.

+++
** When called interactively, 'goto-char' now offers the number at
point as default.

+++
** When 'suggest-key-bindings' is non-nil, the completion list of 'M-x'
shows equivalent key bindings for all commands that have them.

** Autosaving via 'auto-save-visited-mode' can now be inhibited by
setting the variable 'auto-save-visited-mode' buffer-locally to nil.

** New commands to describe buttons and widgets have been added.
'widget-describe' (on a widget) will pop up a help buffer and give a
description of the properties.  Likewise 'button-describe' does the
same for a button.

** Obsolete commands are no longer hidden from command completion.
Completion of command names now considers obsolete aliases as
candidates.  Invoking a command via an obsolete alias now mentions the
obsolescence fact and shows the new name of the command.

+++
** New command 'revert-buffer-with-fine-grain'.
Revert a buffer trying to be as non-destructive as possible,
preserving markers, properties and overlays.  The new variable
'revert-buffer-with-fine-grain-max-seconds' specifies the maximum
number of seconds that 'revert-buffer-with-fine-grain' should spend
trying to be non-destructive.

+++
** New command 'memory-report'.
This command opens a new buffer called "*Memory Report*" and gives a
summary of where Emacs is using memory currently.

+++
** The history list for the 'goto-line' command is now a single list
for all buffers by default.  You can configure a separate list for
each buffer by customizing the user option 'goto-line-history-local'.

** Outline

+++
*** New commands to cycle heading visibility.
Typing 'TAB' on a heading cycles the current section between "hide
all", "subheadings", and "show all" state.  Typing 'S-TAB' anywhere in
the buffer cycles the whole buffer between "only top-level headings",
"all headings and subheadings", and "show all" states.


* Changes in Specialized Modes and Packages in Emacs 28.1

** 'blink-cursor-mode' is now enabled by default regardless of the UI.
It used to be enabled when Emacs is started in GUI mode but not when started
in text mode.  The cursor still only actually blinks in GUI frames.

** Bindat
+++
*** New types 'u64' and 'u64r'
+++
*** New macro 'bindat-spec' to define specs, with Edebug support
** pcase

+++
*** The 'pred' pattern can now take the form '(pred (not FUN))'.
This is like '(pred (lambda (x) (not (FUN x))))' but results
in better code.

+++
** profiler.el
The results displayed by 'profiler-report' now have the usage figures
at the left hand side followed by the function name.  This is intended
to make better use of the horizontal space, in particular eliminating
the truncation of function names.  There is no way to get the former
layout back.

** Loading dunnet.el in batch mode doesn't start the game any more.
Instead you need to do "emacs -f dun-batch" to start the game in
batch mode.

** Emacs Server

+++
*** New user option 'server-client-instructions'.
When emacsclient connects, Emacs will (by default) output a message
about how to exit the client frame.  If 'server-client-instructions'
is set to nil, this message is inhibited.

** Perl mode

---
*** New face 'perl-non-scalar-variable'.
This is used to fontify non-scalar variables.

** Python mode

*** 'python-shell-interpreter' now defaults to python3 on systems with python3.

*** 'C-c C-r' can now be used on arbitrary regions.
The command previously extended the start of the region to the start
of the line, but will now actually send the marked region, as
documented.

** Ruby mode

*** 'ruby-use-smie' is declared obsolete.
SMIE is now always enabled and 'ruby-use-smie' only controls whether
indentation is done using SMIE or with the old ad-hoc code.

---
** Specific warnings can now be disabled from the warning buffer.
When a warning is displayed to the user, the resulting buffer now has
buttons which allow making permanent changes to the treatment of that
warning.  Automatic showing of the warning can be disabled (although
it is still logged to the "*Messages*" buffer), or the warning can be
disabled entirely.

** mspool.el

---
*** Autoload the main entry point 'mspool-show'.

** Windows

+++
*** New 'display-buffer' function 'display-buffer-use-least-recent-window'.
This is like 'display-buffer-use-some-window', but won't reuse the
current window, and when called repeatedly will try not to reuse a
previously selected window.

*** New function 'window-bump-use-time'.
This updates the use time of a window.

*** The key prefix 'C-x 4 1' displays next command buffer in the same window.
It's bound to the command 'same-window-prefix' that requests the buffer
of the next command to be displayed in the same window.

*** The key prefix 'C-x 4 4' displays next command buffer in a new window.
It's bound to the command 'other-window-prefix' that requests the buffer
of the next command to be displayed in a new window.

** Frames

*** The key prefix 'C-x 5 5' displays next command buffer in a new frame.
It's bound to the command 'other-frame-prefix' that requests the buffer
of the next command to be displayed in a new frame.

** Tab Bars

*** The key prefix 'C-x t t' displays next command buffer in a new tab.
It's bound to the command 'other-tab-prefix' that requests the buffer
of the next command to be displayed in a new tab.

+++
*** New command 'C-x t C-r' to open file read-only in other tab.

---
*** The tab bar is frame-local when 'tab-bar-show' is a number.
Show/hide the tab bar independently for each frame, according to the
value of 'tab-bar-show'.

---
*** New command 'toggle-frame-tab-bar'.
It can be used to enable/disable the tab bar individually on each frame
independently from the value of 'tab-bar-mode' and 'tab-bar-show'.

---
*** New command 'tab-duplicate'.

---
*** 'Mod-9' bound to 'tab-last' now switches to the last tab.
It also supports a negative argument.

---
*** 'C-x t N' creates a new tab at the specified absolute position.
It also supports a negative argument.

---
*** 'C-x t M' moves the current tab to the specified absolute position.
It also supports a negative argument.

---
*** New user option 'tab-bar-tab-name-format-function'.

---
*** The tabs in the tab line can now be scrolled using horizontal scroll.
If your mouse or trackpad supports it, you can now scroll tabs when
the mouse pointer is in the tab line by scrolling left or right.

---
*** New tab-line faces and options.
The face 'tab-line-tab-special' is used for tabs whose buffers are
special, i.e. not file-backed.  The face
'tab-line-tab-inactive-alternate' is used to display inactive tabs
with an alternating background color, making them easier to
distinguish between, especially if the face 'tab-line-tab' is
configured to not display with a box; this alternate face is only
applied when the option 'tab-line-tab-face-functions' is
so-configured.  That option may also be used to customize tab-line
faces in other ways.

** Occur mode

*** New bindings in occur-mode, 'next-error-no-select' bound to 'n' and
'previous-error-no-select' bound to 'p'.

*** The new command 'recenter-current-error', bound to 'l' in Occur or
compilation buffers, recenters the current displayed occurrence/error.

** EIEIO

+++
*** The macro 'oref-default' can now be used with 'setf'.
It is now defined as a generalized variable that can be used with
'setf' to modify the value stored in a given class slot.

** New minor mode 'cl-font-lock-built-in-mode' for 'lisp-mode'.
The mode provides refined highlighting of built-in functions, types,
and variables.

** Archive mode

---
*** Archive Mode can now parse ".squashfs" files.

*** Can now modify members of 'ar' archives.

*** Display of summaries unified between backends.

*** New user option 'archive-hidden-columns' and command
'archive-hideshow-column'.  These let you control which columns are
displayed and which are kept hidden.

---
*** New command bound to 'C': 'archive-copy-file'.
This command extracts the file under point and writes the data to a
file.

** Emacs Lisp mode

*** The mode-line now indicates whether we're using lexical or dynamic scoping.

*** A space between an open paren and a symbol changes the indentation rule.
The presence of a space between an open paren and a symbol now is
taken as a statement by the programmer that this should be indented
as a data list rather than as a piece of code.

** Calendar

+++
*** New user option 'calendar-time-zone-style'.
If 'numeric', calendar functions (eg 'calendar-sunrise-sunset') that display
time zones will use a form like "+0100" instead of "CET".

** Dired

---
*** Behavior change on 'dired-clean-confirm-killing-deleted-buffers'.
Previously, if 'dired-clean-up-buffers-too' was non-nil, and
'dired-clean-confirm-killing-deleted-buffers' was nil, the buffers
wouldn't be killed.  This combination will now kill the buffers.

+++
*** New user option 'dired-switches-in-mode-line'.
This user option controls how 'ls' switches are displayed in the mode
line, and allows truncating them (to preserve space on the mode line)
or showing them literally, either instead of, or in addition to,
displaying "by name" or "by date" sort order.

---
*** Broken and circular links are shown with the 'dired-broken-symlink' face.

*** '=' ('dired-diff') will now put all backup files into the 'M-n' history.
When using '=' on a file with backup files, the default file to use
for diffing is the newest backup file.  You can now use 'M-n' to quickly
select a different backup file instead.

+++
*** New user option 'dired-maybe-use-globstar'.
If set, enables globstar (recursive globbing) in shells that support
this feature, but turn it off by default.  This allows producing
directory listings with files matching a wildcard in all the
subdirectories of a given directory.  The new variable
'dired-enable-globstar-in-shell' lists which shells can have globstar
enabled, and how to enable it.

+++
*** New user option 'dired-copy-dereference'.
If set to non-nil, Dired will dereference symbolic links when copying.
This can be switched off on a per-usage basis by providing
'dired-do-copy' with a 'C-u' prefix.

*** New user option 'dired-mark-region' affects all Dired commands
that mark files.  When non-nil and the region is active in Transient
Mark mode, then Dired commands operate only on files in the active
region.  The values 'file' and 'line' of this user option define the
details of marking the file at the end of the region.

*** State changing VC operations are supported in Dired on files and
directories with the help of new command 'dired-vc-next-action'.

+++
*** 'dired-jump' and 'dired-jump-other-window' moved from 'dired-x' to 'dired'.
The 'dired-jump' and 'dired-jump-other-window' commands have been
moved from the 'dired-x' package to 'dired'.  The user option
'dired-bind-jump' no longer has any effect and is now obsolete.
The commands are now bound to 'C-x C-j' and 'C-x 4 C-j' by default.

To get the old behavior of 'dired-bind-jump' back and unbind the above
keys, add the following to your init file:

(global-set-key "\C-x\C-j" nil)
(global-set-key "\C-x4\C-j" nil)

** Change Logs and VC

*** More VC commands can be used from non-file buffers.
The relevant commands are those that don't change the VC state.
The non-file buffers which can use VC commands are those that have
their 'default-directory' under VC.

*** New command 'vc-dir-root' uses the root directory without asking.

---
*** New face 'log-view-commit-body'.
This is used when expanding commit messages from 'vc-print-root-log'
and similar commands.

---
*** New faces for 'vc-dir' buffers.
Those are: 'vc-dir-header', 'vc-dir-header-value', 'vc-dir-directory',
'vc-dir-file', 'vc-dir-mark-indicator', 'vc-dir-status-warning',
'vc-dir-status-edited', 'vc-dir-status-up-to-date',
'vc-dir-status-ignored'.

---
*** The responsible VC backend is now the most specific one.
'vc-responsible-backend' loops over the backends in
'vc-handled-backends' to determine which backend is responsible for a
specific (unregistered) file.  Previously the first matching backend
was chosen, but now the one with the most specific path is chosen (in
case there's a directory handled by one backend inside another).

*** New commands 'vc-dir-mark-registered-files' (bound to '* r') and
'vc-dir-mark-unregistered-files'.

*** Support for bookmark.el.
Bookmark locations can refer to VC directory buffers.

---
*** New user option 'vc-hg-create-bookmark'.
It controls whether a bookmark or branch will be created when you
invoke 'C-u C-x v s' ('vc-create-tag').

---
*** 'vc-hg' now uses 'hg summary' to populate extra 'vc-dir' headers.

---
*** New user option 'vc-git-revision-complete-only-branches'.
If non-nil, only branches and remotes are considered when doing
completion over Git branch names.  The default is nil, which causes
tags to be considered as well.

** Gnus

+++
*** New user option 'gnus-registry-register-all'.
If non-nil (the default), create registry entries for all messages.
If nil, don't automatically create entries, they must be created
manually.

+++
*** New user options to customise the summary line specs "%[" and "%]".
Four new options introduced in customisation group
'gnus-summary-format'.  These are 'gnus-sum-opening-bracket',
'gnus-sum-closing-bracket', 'gnus-sum-opening-bracket-adopted', and
'gnus-sum-closing-bracket-adopted'.  Their default values are "[", "]",
"<", ">" respectively.  These options control the appearance of "%["
and "%]" specs in the summary line format.  "%[" will normally display
the value of 'gnus-sum-opening-bracket', but can also be
'gnus-sum-opening-bracket-adopted' for the adopted articles.  "%]" will
normally display the value of 'gnus-sum-closing-bracket', but can also
be 'gnus-sum-closing-bracket-adopted' for the adopted articles.

+++
*** New user option 'gnus-paging-select-next'.
This controls what happens when using commands like 'SPC' and 'DEL' to
page the current article.  If non-nil (the default), go to the
next/prev article, but if nil, do nothing at the end/start of the article.

+++
*** New gnus-search library.
A new unified search syntax which can be used across multiple
supported search engines.  Set 'gnus-search-use-parsed-queries' to
non-nil to enable.

+++
*** New value for user option 'smiley-style'.
Smileys can now be rendered with emojis instead of small images when
using the new 'emoji' value in 'smiley-style'.

+++
*** New user option 'gnus-agent-eagerly-store-articles'.
If non-nil (which is the default), the Gnus Agent will store all read
articles in the Agent cache.

+++
*** New user option 'gnus-global-groups'.
Gnus handles private groups differently from public (i.e., NNTP-like)
groups.  Most importantly, Gnus doesn't download external images from
mail-like groups.  This can be overridden by putting group names in
'gnus-global-groups': Any group present in that list will be treated
like a public group.

+++
*** New scoring types for the Date header.
You can now score based on the relative age of an article with the new
'<' and '>' date scoring types.

+++
*** User-defined scoring is now possible.
The new type is 'score-fn'.  More information in the Gnus manual node
"(gnus) Score File Format".

+++
*** New backend 'nnselect'.
The newly added 'nnselect' backend allows creating groups from an
arbitrary list of articles that may come from multiple groups and
servers.  These groups generally behave like any other group: they may
be ephemeral or persistent, and allow article marking, moving,
deletion, etc.  'nnselect' groups may be created like any other group,
but there are three convenience functions for the common case of
obtaining the list of articles as a result of a search:
'gnus-group-make-search-group' ('G g') that will prompt for an 'nnir'
search query and create a persistent group for that search;
'gnus-group-read-ephemeral-search-group' ('G G') that will prompt for
an 'nnir' search query and create an ephemeral group for that search;
and 'gnus-summary-make-group-from-search' ('C-c C-p') that will create
a persistent group with the search parameters of a current ephemeral
search group.

As part of this addition, the user option 'nnir-summary-line-format'
has been removed; its functionality is now available directly in the
'gnus-summary-line-format' specs '%G' and '%g'.  The user option
'gnus-refer-thread-use-nnir' has been renamed to
'gnus-refer-thread-use-search'.

+++
*** New user option 'gnus-dbus-close-on-sleep'.
On systems with D-Bus support, it is now possible to register a signal
to close all Gnus servers before the system sleeps.

+++
*** The key binding of 'gnus-summary-search-article-forward' has changed.
This command was previously on 'M-s' and shadowed the global 'M-s'
search prefix.  The command has now been moved to 'M-s M-s'.  (For
consistency, the 'M-s M-r' key binding has been added for the
'gnus-summary-search-article-backward' command.)

---
*** The value of "all" in the 'large-newsgroup-initial' group parameter changes.
It was previously nil, which didn't work, because nil is
indistinguishable from not being present.  The new value for "all" is
the symbol 'all'.

+++
*** The name of dependent Gnus sessions has changed from "slave" to "child".
The names of the commands 'gnus-slave', 'gnus-slave-no-server' and
'gnus-slave-unplugged' have changed to 'gnus-child',
'gnus-child-no-server' and 'gnus-child-unplugged' respectively.

+++
*** The 'W Q' summary mode command now takes a numerical prefix to
allow adjusting the fill width.

+++
*** New variable 'mm-inline-font-lock'.
This variable is supposed to be bound by callers to determine whether
inline MIME parts (that support it) are supposed to be font-locked or
not.

** Message

---
*** Respect 'message-forward-ignored-headers' more.
Previously, this user option would not be consulted if
'message-forward-show-mml' was nil and forwarding as MIME.

+++
*** New user option 'message-forward-included-mime-headers'.
This is used when forwarding messages as MIME, but not using MML.

+++
*** Message now supports the OpenPGP header.
To generate these headers, add the new function
'message-add-openpgp-header' to 'message-send-hook'.  The header will
be generated according to the new 'message-openpgp-header' variable.

---
*** A change to how "Mail-Copies-To: never" is handled.
If a user has specified "Mail-Copies-To: never", and Message was asked
to do a "wide reply", some other arbitrary recipient would end up in
the resulting "To" header, while the remaining recipients would be put
in the "Cc" header.  This is somewhat misleading, as it looks like
you're responding to a specific person in particular.  This has been
changed so that all the recipients are put in the "To" header in these
instances.

+++
*** New command to start Emacs in Message mode to send an email.
Emacs can be defined as a handler for the "x-scheme-handler/mailto"
MIME type with the following command: "emacs -f message-mailto %u".
An "emacs-mail.desktop" file has been included, suitable for
installing in desktop directories like "/usr/share/applications".
Clicking on a 'mailto:' link in other applications will then open
Emacs with headers filled out according to the link, e.g.
"mailto:larsi@gnus.org?subject=This+is+a+test".

---
*** Change to default value of 'message-draft-headers' user option.
The 'Date' symbol has been removed from the default value, meaning that
draft or delayed messages will get a date reflecting when the message
was sent.  To restore the original behavior of dating a message
from when it is first saved or delayed, add the symbol 'Date' back to
this user option.

+++
*** New command to take screenshots.
In Message mode buffers, the 'C-c C-p' ('message-insert-screenshot')
command has been added.  It depends on using an external program to
take the actual screenshot, and defaults to "ImageMagick import".

** Smtpmail

+++
*** Allow direct selection of smtp authentication mechanism.
A server entry retrieved by auth-source can request a desired smtp
authentication mechanism by setting a value for the key 'smtp-auth'.

** Grep

+++
*** New user option 'grep-match-regexp' matches grep markers to highlight.
Grep emits SGR ANSI escape sequences to color its output.  The new
user option 'grep-match-regexp' holds the regular expression to match
the appropriate markers in order to provide highlighting in the source
buffer.  The user option can be customized to accommodate other
grep-like tools.

---
*** The 'lgrep' command now ignores directories.
On systems where the grep command supports it, directories will be
skipped.

** Help

---
*** 'g' ('revert-buffer') in 'help-mode' no longer requires confirmation.

+++
*** New command 'describe-keymap' describes keybindings in a keymap.

---
*** New keybinding 'C-h R' prompts for a manual to display and displays it.

+++
** New command 'lossage-size'.
It allows users to set the maximum number of keystrokes and commands
recorded for the purpose of 'view-lossage'.

---
*** The command 'view-lossage' can now be invoked from the menu bar.
The menu bar "Help" menu now has a "Show Recent Inputs" item under the
"Describe" sub-menu.

** Input methods

+++
*** Emacs now supports "transient" input methods.
A transient input method is enabled for inserting a single character,
and is then automatically disabled.  'C-x \' temporarily enables the
selected transient input method.  Use 'C-u C-x \' to select a
transient input method (which can be different from the input method
enabled by 'C-\').  For example, 'C-u C-x \ compose RET' selects the
'compose' input method; then typing 'C-x \ 1 2' will insert the
character '½', and disable the 'compose' input method afterwards.
You can use 'C-x \' in incremental search to insert a single character
to the search string.

---
*** New input method 'compose' based on X Multi_key sequences.

---
*** New input method 'iso-transl' with the same keys as 'C-x 8'.
After selecting it as a transient input method with 'C-u C-x \
iso-transl RET', it supports the same key sequences as 'C-x 8',
so e.g. like 'C-x 8 [' inserts a left single quotation mark,
'C-x \ [' does the same.

---
*** New user options 'read-char-by-name-sort' and 'read-char-by-name-group'.
'read-char-by-name-sort' defines the sorting order of characters for
completion of 'C-x 8 RET TAB' and can be customized to sort them
by codepoints instead of character names by default.  The 't' value of
'read-char-by-name-group' groups the characters for completion of
'C-x 8 RET TAB' by Unicode blocks.

---
*** Improved language transliteration in Malayalam input methods.
Added a new Mozhi scheme.  The inapplicable ITRANS scheme is now
deprecated.  Errors in the Inscript method were corrected.

---
*** New input method 'cham'.
There's also a Cham greeting in "etc/HELLO".

** Ispell

+++
*** 'ispell-comments-and-strings' now accepts START and END arguments,
defaulting to active region when used interactively.

+++
*** New command 'ispell-comment-or-string-at-point' is provided.

---
** The old non-SMIE indentation of 'sh-mode' has been removed.

---
** The 'list-bookmark' menu is now based on 'tabulated-list-mode'.
The interactive bookmark list will now benefit from features in
'tabulated-list-mode' like sorting columns or changing column width.

Support for the optional "inline" header line, allowing for a header
without using 'header-line-format', has been dropped.  Consequently,
the variables 'bookmark-bmenu-use-header-line' and
'bookmark-bmenu-inline-header-height' are now declared obsolete.

---
** The sb-image.el library is now marked obsolete.
This file was a compatibility kludge which is no longer needed.

---
** Lisp mode now uses 'common-lisp-indent-function'.
To revert to the previous behavior,
'(setq lisp-indent-function 'lisp-indent-function)' from 'lisp-mode-hook'.

** Customize

*** Most customize commands now hide obsolete user options.
Obsolete user options are no longer shown in the listings produced by
the commands 'customize', 'customize-group', 'customize-apropos' and
'customize-changed'.

To customize obsolete user options, use 'customize-option' or
'customize-saved'.

** Edebug

---
*** Obsoletions
**** 'get-edebug-spec' is obsolete, replaced by 'edebug-get-spec'.

+++
**** The spec operator ':name NAME' is obsolete, use '&name' instead.
+++
**** The spec element 'function-form' is obsolete, use 'form' instead.

+++
*** New function 'def-edebug-elem-spec' to define Edebug spec elements.
These used to be defined with 'def-edebug-spec' thus conflating the
two name spaces, which lead to name collisions.
The use of 'def-edebug-spec' to define Edebug spec elements is
declared obsolete.

*** Edebug specification lists can use some new keywords:

+++
**** '&interpose SPEC FUN ARGS..' lets FUN control parsing after SPEC.
More specifically, FUN is called with 'HEAD PF ARGS..' where
PF is a parsing function that expects a single argument (the specs to
use) and HEAD is the code that matched SPEC.

+++
**** '&error MSG' unconditionally aborts the current edebug instrumentation.

+++
**** '&name SPEC FUN' extracts the current name from the code matching SPEC.

** ElDoc

+++
*** New user option 'eldoc-echo-area-display-truncation-message'.
If non-nil (the default), eldoc will display a message saying
something like "(Documentation truncated. Use `M-x eldoc-doc-buffer'
to see rest)" when a message has been truncated.  If nil, truncated
messages will be marked with just "..." at the end.

+++
*** New hook 'eldoc-documentation-functions'.
This hook is intended to be used for registering doc string functions.
These functions don't need to produce the doc string right away, they
may arrange for it to be produced asynchronously.  The results of all
doc string functions are accessible to the user through the user
option 'eldoc-documentation-strategy'.

*** New hook 'eldoc-display-functions'.
This hook is intended to be used for displaying doc strings.  The
functions receive the doc string composed according to
'eldoc-documentation-strategy' and are tasked with displaying it to
the user.  Examples of such functions would use the echo area, a
separate buffer, or a tooltip.

+++
*** New user option 'eldoc-documentation-strategy'.
The built-in choices available for this user option let users compose
the results of 'eldoc-documentation-functions' in various ways, even
if some of those functions are synchronous and some asynchronous.
The user option replaces 'eldoc-documentation-function', which is now
obsolete.

*** 'eldoc-echo-area-use-multiline-p' is now handled by ElDoc.
The user option 'eldoc-echo-area-use-multiline-p' is now handled
by the ElDoc library itself.  Functions in
'eldoc-documentation-functions' don't need to worry about consulting
it when producing a doc string.

** Shell

---
*** New command in 'shell-mode': 'narrow-to-prompt'.
This is bound to 'C-x n d' in 'shell-mode' buffers, and narrows to the
command line under point (and any following output).

** Eshell

---
*** 'eshell-hist-ignoredups' can now also be used to mimic "erasedups" in bash.

---
*** Environment variable 'INSIDE_EMACS' is now copied to subprocesses.
Its value equals the result of evaluating '(format "%s,eshell" emacs-version)'.

---
*** Eshell no longer re-initializes its keymap every call.
This allows users to use (define-key eshell-mode-map ...) as usual.
Some modules have their own minor mode now to account for these
changes.

** EUDC

+++
*** New macOS Contacts backend.
This backend works on newer versions of macOS and is generally
preferred over the eudcb-mab.el backend.

** Tramp

+++
*** New connection method "mtp", which allows accessing media devices
like cell phones, tablets or cameras.

+++
*** Trashed remote files are moved to the local trash directory.
All remote files, which are trashed, are moved to the local trash
directory.  Except remote encrypted files, which are always deleted.

+++
*** New command 'tramp-crypt-add-directory'.
This command marks a remote directory to contain only encrypted files.
See the "(tramp) Keeping files encrypted" node of the Tramp manual for
details.  This feature is experimental.

+++
*** Support of direct asynchronous process invocation.
When Tramp connection property "direct-async-process" is set to
non-nil for a given connection, 'make-process' and 'start-file-process'
calls are performed directly as in "ssh ... <command>".  This avoids
initialization performance penalties.  See the "(tramp) Improving
performance of asynchronous remote processes" node of the Tramp manual
for details, and also for a discussion or restrictions.  This feature
is experimental.

+++
*** New user option 'tramp-debug-to-file'.
When non-nil, this user option instructs Tramp to mirror the debug
buffer to a file under the "/tmp/" directory.  This is useful, if (in
rare cases) Tramp blocks Emacs, and we need further debug information.

** Tempo

---
*** 'tempo-define-template' can now re-assign templates to tags.
Previously, assigning a new template to an already defined tag had no
effect.

** map.el

*** Pcase 'map' pattern added keyword symbols abbreviation.
A pattern like '(map :sym)' binds the map's value for ':sym' to 'sym',
equivalent to '(map (:sym sym))'.

** Package

+++
*** New commands to filter the package list.
The filter commands are bound to the following keys:

key             binding
---             -------
/ a             package-menu-filter-by-archive
/ d             package-menu-filter-by-description
/ k             package-menu-filter-by-keyword
/ N             package-menu-filter-by-name-or-description
/ n             package-menu-filter-by-name
/ s             package-menu-filter-by-status
/ v             package-menu-filter-by-version
/ m             package-menu-filter-marked
/ u             package-menu-filter-upgradable
/ /             package-menu-filter-clear

---
*** Column widths in 'list-packages' display can now be customized.
See the new user options 'package-name-column-width',
'package-version-column-width', 'package-status-column-width', and
'package-archive-column-width'.

** gdb-mi

+++
*** gdb-mi can now store and restore window configurations.
Use 'gdb-save-window-configuration' to save window configuration to a
file and 'gdb-load-window-configuration' to load from a file.  These
commands can also be accessed through the menu bar under 'Gud --
GDB-Windows'.  'gdb-default-window-configuration-file', when non-nil,
is loaded when GDB starts up.

+++
*** gdb-mi can now restore window configuration after quit.
Set 'gdb-restore-window-configuration-after-quit' to non-nil and Emacs
will remember the window configuration before GDB started and restore
it after GDB quits.  A toggle button is also provided under 'Gud --
GDB-Windows'.

+++
*** gdb-mi now has a better logic for displaying source buffers.
Now GDB only uses one source window to display source file by default.
Customize 'gdb-max-source-window-count' to use more than one window.
Control source file display by 'gdb-display-source-buffer-action'.

+++
*** The default value of 'gdb-mi-decode-strings' is now t.
This means that the default coding-system is now used to decode strings
and source file names from GDB.

** Gravatar

---
*** New user option 'gravatar-service' for host to query for gravatars.
Defaults to 'libravatar', with 'unicornify' and 'gravatar' as options.

** Compilation mode

*** Regexp matching of messages is now case-sensitive by default.
The variable 'compilation-error-case-fold-search' can be set for
case-insensitive matching of messages when the old behavior is
required, but the recommended solution is to use a correctly matching
regexp instead.

---
*** Messages from ShellCheck are now recognized.

---
*** Messages from Visual Studio that mention column numbers are now recognized.

** Hi Lock mode

---
*** Matching in 'hi-lock-mode' is case-sensitive when regexp contains
upper case characters and 'search-upper-case' is non-nil.
'highlight-phrase' also uses 'search-whitespace-regexp'
to substitute spaces in regexp search.

---
*** The default value of 'hi-lock-highlight-range' was enlarged.
The new default value is 2000000 (2 megabytes).

** Whitespace mode

+++
*** New style 'missing-newline-at-eof'.
If present in 'whitespace-style' (as it is by default), the final
character in the buffer will be highlighted if the buffer doesn't end
with a newline.

---
*** The default 'whitespace-enable-predicate' predicate has changed.
It used to check elements in the list version of
'whitespace-global-modes' with 'eq', but now uses 'derived-mode-p'.

** Texinfo

---
*** New user option 'texinfo-texi2dvi-options'.
This is used when invoking 'texi2dvi' from 'texinfo-tex-buffer'.

---
*** New commands for moving in and between environments.
An "environment" is something that ends with '@end'.  The commands are
'C-c C-c C-f' (next end), 'C-c C-c C-b' (previous end),
'C-c C-c C-n' (next start) and 'C-c C-c C-p' (previous start), as well
as 'C-c .', which will alternate between the start and the end of the
current environment.

** Rmail

---
*** New user option 'rmail-re-abbrevs'.
Its default value matches localized abbreviations of the "reply"
prefix on the Subject line in various languages.

---
*** New user option 'shr-offer-extend-specpdl'.
If this is nil, rendering of HTML in the email message body that
requires to enlarge 'max-specpdl-size', the number of Lisp variable
bindings, will be aborted, and Emacs will not ask you whether to
enlarge 'max-specpdl-size' to complete the rendering.  The default is
t, which preserves the original behavior.

---
*** New user option 'rmail-show-message-set-modified'.
If set non-nil, showing an unseen message will set the Rmail buffer's
modified flag.

** Apropos

*** New commands 'apropos-next-symbol' and 'apropos-previous-symbol'.
These new navigation commands are bound to 'n' and 'p' in
'apropos-mode'.

*** New command 'apropos-function'.
This works like 'C-u M-x apropos-command' but is more discoverable.

** CC Mode

*** Added support for Doxygen documentation style.
'doxygen' is now a valid 'c-doc-comment-style' which recognises all
comment styles supported by Doxygen (namely '///', '//!', '/** … */'
and '/*! … */'.  'gtkdoc' remains the default for C and C++ modes; to
use 'doxygen' by default one might evaluate:

    (setq-default c-doc-comment-style
                  '((java-mode . javadoc)
                    (pike-mode . autodoc)
                    (c-mode    . doxygen)
                    (c++-mode  . doxygen)))

or use it in a custom 'c-style'.

*** Added support to line up '?' and ':' of a ternary operator.
The new 'c-lineup-ternary-bodies' function can be used as a lineup
function to align question mark and colon which are part of a ternary
operator ('?:').  For example:

    return arg % 2 == 0 ? arg / 2
                        : (3 * arg + 1);

To enable, add it to appropriate entries in 'c-offsets-alist', e.g.:

    (c-set-offset 'arglist-cont '(c-lineup-ternary-bodies
                                  c-lineup-gcc-asm-reg))
    (c-set-offset 'arglist-cont-nonempty '(c-lineup-ternary-bodies
                                           c-lineup-gcc-asm-reg
                                           c-lineup-arglist))
    (c-set-offset 'statement-cont '(c-lineup-ternary-bodies +))

** browse-url

*** Added support for custom URL handlers.
There is a new variable 'browse-url-default-handlers' and a user
option 'browse-url-handlers' being alists with '(REGEXP-OR-PREDICATE
. FUNCTION)' entries allowing to define different browsing FUNCTIONs
depending on the URL to be browsed.  The variable is for default
handlers provided by Emacs itself or external packages, the user
option is for the user (and allows for overriding the default
handlers).

Formerly, one could do the same by setting
'browse-url-browser-function' to such an alist.  This usage is still
supported but deprecated.

*** Categorization of browsing commands in internal vs. external.
All standard browsing commands such as 'browse-url-firefox',
'browse-url-mail', or 'eww' have been categorized into internal (URL
is browsed in Emacs) or external (an external application is spawned
with the URL).  This is done by adding a 'browse-url-browser-kind'
symbol property to the browsing commands.  With a new command
'browse-url-with-browser-kind', an URL can explicitly be browsed with
either an internal or external browser.

*** Support for the conkeror browser is now obsolete.

*** Support for the Mosaic browser has been removed.
This support has been obsolete since 25.1.

** SHR

---
*** The command 'shr-browse-url' now supports custom mailto handlers.
Clicking on or otherwise following a 'mailto:' link in a HTML buffer
rendered by SHR previously invoked the command 'browse-url-mailto'.
This is still the case by default, but if you customize
'browse-url-mailto-function' or 'browse-url-handlers' to call some
other function, it will now be called instead of the default.

+++
*** New user option 'shr-max-width'.
If this user option is non-nil, and 'shr-width' is nil, then SHR will
use the value of 'shr-max-width' to limit the width of the rendered
HTML.  The default is 120 characters, so even if you have very wide
frames, HTML text will be rendered more narrowly, which usually leads
to a more readable text.  Set this user option to nil to get the
previous behavior of rendering as wide as the 'window-width' allows.
If 'shr-width' is non-nil, it overrides this variable.

** Images

---
*** You can explicitly specify base_uri for svg images.
':base-uri' image property can be used to explicitly specify base_uri
for embedded images into svg.  ':base-uri' is supported for both file
and data svg images.

+++
*** 'svg-embed-base-uri-image' added to embed images.
'svg-embed-base-uri-image' can be used to embed images located
relatively to 'file-name-directory' of the ':base-uri' svg image property.
This works much faster then 'svg-embed'.

+++
*** New function 'image-cache-size'.
This function returns the size of the current image cache, in bytes.

---
*** Animated images stop automatically under high CPU pressure sooner.
Previously, an animated image would stop animating if any single image
took more than two seconds to display.  The new algorithm maintains a
decaying average of delays, and if this number gets too high, the
animation is stopped.

+++
*** The 'n' and 'p' commands (next/previous image) now respects dired order.
These commands would previously display the next/previous image in
alphabetical order, but will now find the "parent" dired buffer and
select the next/previous image file according to how the files are
sorted there.  The commands have also been extended to work when the
"parent" buffer is an archive mode (i.e., zip file or the like) or tar
mode buffer.

---
*** 'image-converter' is now restricted to formats in 'auto-mode-alist'.
When using external image converters, the external program is queried
for what formats it supports.  This list may contain formats that are
problematic in some contexts (like PDFs), so this list is now filtered
based on 'auto-mode-alist'.  Only file names that map to 'image-mode'
are now supported.

---
*** The background and foreground of images now default to face colors.
When an image doesn't specify a foreground or background color, Emacs
now uses colors from the face used to draw the surrounding text
instead of the frame's default colors.

To load images with the default frame colors use the ':foreground' and
':background' image attributes, for example:

    (create-image "filename" nil nil
                  :foreground (face-attribute 'default :foreground)
                  :background (face-attribute 'default :background))

This change only affects image types that support foreground and
background colors or transparency, such as xbm, pbm, svg, png and gif.

** EWW

+++
*** New user option 'eww-use-browse-url'.
This is a regexp that can be set to alter how links are followed in eww.

+++
*** New user option 'eww-retrieve-command'.
This can be used to download data via an external command.  If nil
(the default), then 'url-retrieve' is used.

+++
*** New Emacs command line convenience command.
The 'eww-browse' command has been added, which allows you to register
Emacs as a MIME handler for "text/x-uri", and will call 'eww' on the
supplied URL.  Usage example: "emacs -f eww-browse https://gnu.org".

+++
*** 'eww-download-directory' will now use the XDG location, if defined.
However, if "~/Downloads/" already exists, that will continue to be
used.

---
*** The command 'eww-follow-link' now supports custom mailto handlers.
The function that is invoked when clicking on or otherwise following a
'mailto:' link in an EWW buffer can now be customized.  For more
information, see the related entry about 'shr-browse-url' above.

** Project

*** New user option 'project-vc-merge-submodules'.

*** Project commands now have their own history.
Previously used project directories are now suggested by all commands
that prompt for a project directory.

+++
*** New prefix keymap 'project-prefix-map'.
Key sequences that invoke project-related commands start with the
prefix 'C-x p'.  Type "C-x p C-h" to show the full list.

+++
*** New commands 'project-dired', 'project-vc-dir', 'project-shell',
'project-eshell'.  These commands run Dired/VC-Dir and Shell/Eshell in
a project's root directory, respectively.

+++
*** New command 'project-compile'.
This command runs compilation in the current project's root
directory.

+++
*** New command 'project-switch-project'.
This command lets you "switch" to another project and run a project
command chosen from a dispatch menu.

+++
*** New commands 'project-shell-command' and 'project-async-shell-command'.
These commands run 'shell-command' and 'async-shell-command' in a
project's root directory, respectively.

+++
*** New user option 'project-list-file'.

** xref

---
*** Prefix arg of 'xref-goto-xref' quits the "*xref*" buffer.
So typing 'C-u RET' in the "*xref*" buffer quits its window
before navigating to the selected location.

*** New user options 'xref-search-program' and 'xref-search-program-alist'.
So far 'grep' and 'ripgrep' are supported.  'ripgrep' seems to offer better
performance in certain cases, in particular for case-insensitive
searches.

+++
*** New commands 'xref-prev-group' and 'xref-next-group'.
These commands are bound respectively to 'P' and 'N', and navigate to
the first item of the previous or next group in the "*xref*" buffer.

*** New alternative value for 'xref-show-definitions-function':
'xref-show-definitions-completing-read'.

*** The two existing alternatives for 'xref-show-definitions-function'
have been renamed to have "proper" public names and documented
('xref-show-definitions-buffer' and
'xref-show-definitions-buffer-at-bottom').

*** New command 'xref-quit-and-pop-marker-stack' and a binding for it
in "*xref*" buffers ('M-,'). This combination is easy to press
semi-accidentally if the user wants to go back in the middle of
choosing the exact definition to go to, and this should do TRT.

---
*** New value 'project-relative' for 'xref-file-name-display'.
If chosen, file names in "*xref*" buffers will be displayed relative
to the 'project-root' of the current project, when available.

** json.el

---
*** JSON number parsing is now stricter.
Numbers with a leading plus sign, leading zeros, or a missing integer
component are now rejected by 'json-read' and friends.  This makes
them more compliant with the JSON specification and consistent with
the native JSON parsing functions.

** xml.el

*** XML serialization functions now reject invalid characters.
Previously 'xml-print' would produce invalid XML when given a string
with characters that are not valid in XML (see
https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#charsets).  Now it rejects such strings.

** erc

---
*** erc-services.el now supports NickServ passwords from auth-source.
The 'erc-use-auth-source-for-nickserv-password' user option enables
querying auth-source for NickServ passwords.  To enable this, add the
following to your init file:

    (setq erc-prompt-for-nickserv-password nil
          erc-use-auth-source-for-nickserv-password t)

---
*** The '/ignore' command will now ask for a timeout to stop ignoring the user.
Allowed inputs are seconds or ISO8601-like periods like "1h" or "4h30m".

---
*** ERC now recognizes 'C-]' for italic text.
Italic text is displayed in the new 'erc-italic-face'.

---
*** The erc-compat.el library is now marked obsolete.
This file contained ERC compatibility code for Emacs 21 and XEmacs
which is no longer needed.

---
*** erc-match.el now supports 'message' highlight type (not including the nick).
The 'erc-current-nick-highlight-type', 'erc-pal-highlight-type',
'erc-fool-highlight-type', 'erc-keyword-highlight-type', and
'erc-dangerous-host-highlight-type' variables now support a 'message'
type for highlighting the entire message but not the sender's nick.

*** erc-status-sidebar.el is now part of ERC.
The 'erc-status-sidebar' package which provides a HexChat-like
activity overview sidebar for joined IRC channels is now part of ERC.

** Battery

---
*** UPower is now the default battery status backend when available.
UPower support via the function 'battery-upower' was added in Emacs
26.1, but was disabled by default.  It is now the default value of
'battery-status-function' when the system provides a UPower D-Bus
service.  The user options 'battery-upower-device' and
'battery-upower-subscribe' control which power sources to query and
whether to respond to status change notifications in addition to
polling, respectively.

---
*** A richer syntax can be used to format battery status information.
The user options 'battery-mode-line-format' and
'battery-echo-area-format' now support the full formatting syntax of
the function 'format-spec' documented under node "(elisp) Custom Format
Strings".  The new syntax includes specifiers for padding and
truncation, amongst other things.

** bug-reference.el

---
*** Bug reference mode auto-setup.  If 'bug-reference-mode' or
'bug-reference-prog-mode' have been activated, their respective hook
has been run and still 'bug-reference-bug-regexp' and
'bug-reference-url-format' aren't both set, it tries to guess
appropriate values for those two variables.  There are three guessing
mechanisms so far: based on version control information of the current
buffer's file, based on newsgroup/mail-folder name and several news
and mail message headers in Gnus buffers, and based on IRC channel and
network in rcirc and ERC buffers.  All mechanisms are extensible with
custom rules, see the variables 'bug-reference-setup-from-vc-alist',
'bug-reference-setup-from-mail-alist', and
'bug-reference-setup-from-irc-alist'.

** HTML Mode

---
*** A new skeleton for adding relative URLs has been added.
It's bound to the 'C-c C-c f' keystroke, and prompts for a local file
name.

** Recentf

---
*** The recentf files are no longer backed up.

---
*** 'recentf-auto-cleanup' time string now repeats.
When 'recentf-auto-cleanup' is set to a time string, it now repeats
every day, rather than only running once after the mode is turned on.

** Calc

---
*** The behavior when doing forward-delete has been changed.
Previously, using the 'C-d' command would delete the final number in
the input field, no matter where point was.  This has been changed to
work more traditionally, with 'C-d' deleting the next character.
Likewise, point isn't moved to the end of the string before inserting
digits.

+++
*** Setting the word size to zero disables word clipping.
The word size normally clips the results of certain bit-oriented
operations such as shifts and bitwise XOR.  A word size of zero, set
by 'b w', makes the operation have effect on the whole argument values
and the result is not truncated in any way.

---
*** The '/' operator now has higher precedence in (La)TeX input mode.
It no longer has lower precedence than '+' and '-'.

---
*** Calc now marks its windows dedicated.
The new user option 'calc-make-windows-dedicated' controls this.  It
is t by default; set to nil to get back the old behavior.

** term-mode

---
*** New user option 'term-scroll-snap-to-bottom'.
By default, 'term' and 'ansi-term' will now recenter the buffer so
that the prompt is on the final line in the window.  Setting this new
user option to nil inhibits this behavior.

---
*** New user option 'term-set-terminal-size'
If non-nil, the 'LINES' and 'COLUMNS' environment variables will be set
based on the current window size.  In previous versions of Emacs, this
was always done (and that could lead to odd displays when resizing the
window after starting).  This variable defaults to nil.

** Widget

+++
*** 'widget-choose' now supports menus in extended format.

---
*** The 'editable-list' widget now supports moving items up and down.
You can now move items up and down by deleting and then reinserting
them, using the 'DEL' and 'INS' buttons respectively.  This is useful
in Custom buffers, for example, to change the order of the elements in
a list.

** Diff

---
*** New 'diff-mode' font locking face 'diff-error'.
This face is used for error messages from 'diff'.

+++
*** New command 'diff-refresh-hunk'.
This new command (bound to 'C-c C-l') regenerates the current hunk.

** Buttons

+++
*** New minor mode 'button-mode'.
This minor mode does nothing else than install 'button-buffer-map' as
a minor mode map (which binds the 'TAB' / 'S-TAB' key bindings to navigate
to buttons), and can be used in any view-mode-like buffer that has
buttons in it.

+++
*** New utility function 'button-buttonize'.
This function takes a string and returns a string propertized in a way
that makes it a valid button.

** subr-x
+++
*** A number of new string manipulation functions have been added.
'string-clean-whitespace', 'string-fill', 'string-limit',
'string-lines', 'string-pad' and 'string-chop-newline'.

*** New macro 'named-let' that provides Scheme's "named let" looping construct.

** thingatpt

+++
*** New variable 'thing-at-point-provider-alist'.
This allows mode-specific alterations to how 'thing-at-point' works.

** Enriched mode

---
*** 'C-a' is by default no longer bound to 'beginning-of-line-text'.
This is so 'C-a' works as in other modes, and in particular holding
Shift while typing 'C-a', i.e. 'C-S-a', will now highlight the text.

** Miscellaneous

+++
*** New command 'C-x C-k Q' to force redisplay in keyboard macros.

---
*** New user option 'remember-diary-regexp'.

---
*** New user option 'remember-text-format-function'.

*** New function 'buffer-line-statistics'.
This function returns some statistics about the line lengths in a buffer.

+++
*** New variable 'inhibit-interaction' to make user prompts signal an error.
If this is bound to something non-nil, functions like
'read-from-minibuffer', 'read-char' (and related) will signal an
'inhibited-interaction' error.

---
*** 'process-attributes' now works under OpenBSD, too.

+++
*** New button face 'flat-button'.
This is a plain 2D button, but uses the background color instead of
the foreground color.

+++
*** New predicate functions 'length<', 'length>' and 'length='.
Using these functions may be more efficient than using 'length' (if
the length of a (long) list is being computed just to compare this
length to a number).

---
*** 'remove-hook' is now an interactive command.

---
*** New user option 'authinfo-hide-elements'.
This can be set to nil to inhibit hiding passwords in ".authinfo" files.

+++
*** New variable 'current-minibuffer-command'.
This is like 'this-command', but it is bound recursively when entering
the minibuffer.

+++
*** New function 'object-intervals'.
This function returns a copy of the list of intervals (i.e., text
properties) in the object in question (which must either be a string
or a buffer).

---
*** 'hexl-mode' scrolling commands now heed 'next-screen-context-lines'.
Previously, 'hexl-scroll-down' and 'hexl-scroll-up' would scroll
up/down an entire window, but they now work more like the standard
scrolling commands.

---
*** Errors in 'kill-emacs-hook' no longer prevent Emacs from shutting down.
If a function in that hook signals an error in an interactive Emacs,
the user will be prompted on whether to continue.  If the user doesn't
answer within five seconds, Emacs will continue shutting down anyway.

---
*** iso-transl is now preloaded.
This means that keystrokes like 'Alt-[' are defined by default,
instead of only becoming available after doing (for instance)
'C-x 8 <letter>'.

*** New user option 'completions-detailed'.
When non-nil, some commands like 'describe-symbol' show more detailed
completions with more information in completion prefix and suffix.

---
*** User option 'completions-format' supports a new value 'one-column'.

---
*** New user option 'bibtex-unify-case-function'.
This new option allows the user to customize how case is converted
when unifying entries.

---
*** The user option 'bibtex-maintain-sorted-entries' now permits
user-defined sorting schemes.

+++
*** 'format-seconds' can now be used for sub-second times.
The new optional "," parameter has been added, and
'(format-seconds "%mm %,1ss" 66.4)' will now result in "1m 6.4s".

---
*** 'global-display-fill-column-indicator-mode' skips some buffers.
By default, turning on 'global-display-fill-column-indicator-mode'
doesn't turn on 'display-fill-column-indicator-mode' in special-mode
buffers.  This can be controlled by customizing the variable
'global-display-fill-column-indicator-modes'.

---
*** New user option 'compilation-search-all-directories'.
When doing parallel builds, directories and compilation errors may
arrive in the "*compilation*" buffer out-of-order.  If this variable is
non-nil (the default), Emacs will now search backwards in the buffer
for any directory the file with errors may be in.  If nil, this won't
be done (and this restores how this previously worked).

+++
*** New user option 'next-error-message-highlight'.
In addition to a fringe arrow, 'next-error' error may now optionally
highlight the current error message in the 'next-error' buffer.
This user option can be also customized to keep highlighting on all
visited errors, so you can have an overview what errors were already visited.

+++
*** New user option 'tab-first-completion'.
If 'tab-always-indent' is 'complete', this new user option can be used to
further tweak whether to complete or indent.

---
*** 'dired-query' now uses 'read-char-from-minibuffer'.
Using it instead of 'read-char-choice' allows using 'C-x o'
to switch to the help window displayed after typing 'C-h'.

---
*** 'zap-up-to-char' now uses 'read-char-from-minibuffer'.
This allows navigating through the history of characters that have
been input.  This is mostly useful for characters that have complex
input methods where inputting the character again may involve many
keystrokes.

+++
*** Interactive regular expression search now uses faces for sub-groups.
E.g., 'C-M-s foo-\([0-9]+\)' will now use the 'isearch-group-1' face
on the part of the regexp that matches the sub-expression "[0-9]+".
By default, there are two faces for sub-group highlighting, but you
can define more faces whose names are of the form 'isearch-group-N',
where N are successive numbers above 2.

This is controlled by the 'search-highlight-submatches' user option.
This feature is available only on terminals that have enough colors to
distinguish between sub-expression highlighting.

+++
*** Interactive regular expression replace now uses faces for sub-groups.
Like 'search-highlight-submatches', this is controlled by the new user option
'query-replace-highlight-submatches'.

---
*** New user option 'reveal-auto-hide'.
If non-nil (the default), revealed text is automatically hidden when
point leaves the text.  If nil, the text is not hidden again.  Instead
'M-x reveal-hide-revealed' can be used to hide all the revealed text.

+++
*** New user options to control the look of line/column numbers in the mode line.
'mode-line-position-line-format' is the line number format (when
'line-number-mode' is on), 'mode-line-position-column-format' is
the column number format (when 'column-number-mode' is on), and
'mode-line-position-column-line-format' is the combined format (when
both modes are on).

+++
*** New user option 'mode-line-compact'.
If non-nil, repeating spaces are compressed into a single space.  If
'long', this is only done when the mode line is longer than the
current window width (in characters).

+++
*** New command 'submit-emacs-patch'.
This works like 'report-emacs-bug', but is more geared towards sending
patches to the Emacs issue tracker.

+++
*** The user can now customize how "default" values are prompted for.
The new utility function 'format-prompt' has been added which uses the
new 'minibuffer-default-prompt-format' user option to format "default"
prompts.  This means that prompts that look like "Enter a number
(default 10)" can be customized to look like, for instance, "Enter a
number [10]", or not have the default displayed at all, like "Enter a
number".  (This requires that all callers are altered to use
'format-prompt', though.)

+++
*** New global mode 'global-goto-address-mode'.
This will enable 'goto-address-mode' in all buffers.

---
*** 'C-s' in 'M-x' now searches over completions again.
In Emacs 23, typing 'M-x' ('read-extended-command') and then 'C-s' (to
do an interactive search) would search over possible completions.
This was lost in Emacs 24, but is now back again.

---
*** 'M-x report-emacs-bug' will no longer include "Recent messages" section.
These were taken from the "*Messages*" buffer, and may inadvertently
leak information from the reporting user.

---
*** 'count-windows' now takes an optional parameter ALL-FRAMES.
The semantics are as with 'walk-windows'.

---
*** Killing virtual ido buffers interactively will make them go away.
Previously, killing a virtual ido buffer with 'ido-kill-buffer' didn't
do anything.  This has now been changed, and killing virtual buffers
with that command will remove the buffer from recentf.

---
*** New variable 'ffap-file-name-with-spaces'.
If non-nil, 'find-file-at-point' and friends will try to guess more
expansively to identify a file name with spaces.

---
*** Two new commands for centering in 'doc-view-mode'.
The new commands 'doc-view-center-page-horizontally' (bound to 'c h')
and 'doc-view-center-page-vertically' (bound to 'c v') center the page
horizontally and vertically, respectively.

---
*** Change in meaning of 'icomplete-show-matches-on-no-input'.
Previously, choosing a different completion with commands like 'C-.'
and then hitting 'RET' would choose the default completion.  Doing this
will now choose the completion under point instead.  Also when this option
is nil, completions are not shown when the minibuffer reads a file name
with initial input as the default directory.

---
*** The width of the buffer-name column in 'list-buffers' is now dynamic.
The width now depends of the width of the window, but will never be
wider than the length of the longest buffer name, except that it will
never be narrower than 19 characters.

*** Bookmarks can now be targets for new tabs.
When the bookmark.el library is loaded, a customize choice is added
to 'tab-bar-new-tab-choice' for new tabs to show the bookmark list.

---
*** Movement commands in 'gomoku-mode' are fixed.
'gomoku-move-sw' and 'gomoku-move-ne' now work correctly, and
horizontal movements now stop at the edge of the board.

** xterm-mouse mode

---
*** TTY menu navigation is now supported in 'xterm-mouse-mode'.
TTY menus support mouse navigation and selection when 'xterm-mouse-mode'
is active.  When run on a terminal, clicking on the menu bar with the
mouse now pops up a TTY menu by default instead of running the command
'tmm-menubar'.  To restore the old behavior, set the user option
'tty-menu-open-use-tmm' to non-nil.

** text-scale-mode

---
*** 'text-scale-mode' can now adjust font size of the header line.
When the new buffer local variable 'text-scale-remap-header-line'
is non-nil, 'text-scale-adjust' will also scale the text in the header
line when displaying that buffer.

This is useful for major modes that arrange their display in a tabular
form below the header line.  It is enabled by default in
'tabulated-list-mode' and its derived modes.

** xwidget-webkit mode

*** New xwidget commands.
'xwidget-webkit-uri' (return the current URL), 'xwidget-webkit-title'
(return the current title), and 'xwidget-webkit-goto-history' (goto a
point in history).

*** Pixel-based scrolling.
The 'xwidget-webkit-scroll-up', 'xwidget-webkit-scroll-down' commands
now supports scrolling arbitrary pixel values.  It now treats the
optional 2nd argument as the pixel values to scroll.

*** New commands for scrolling.
The new commands 'xwidget-webkit-scroll-up-line',
'xwidget-webkit-scroll-down-line', 'xwidget-webkit-scroll-forward',
'xwidget-webkit-scroll-backward' can be used to scroll webkit by the
height of lines or width of chars.

*** New user option 'xwidget-webkit-bookmark-jump-new-session'.
When non-nil, use a new xwidget webkit session after bookmark jump.
Otherwise, it will use 'xwidget-webkit-last-session'.

** Flymake mode

+++
*** New user options to customize Flymake's mode-line.
The new user option 'flymake-mode-line-format' is a mix of strings and
symbols like 'flymake-mode-line-title', 'flymake-mode-line-exception'
and 'flymake-mode-line-counters'.  The new user option
'flymake-mode-line-counter-format' is a mix of strings and symbols
like 'flymake-mode-line-error-counter',
'flymake-mode-line-warning-counter' and 'flymake-mode-line-note-counter'.

** Flyspell mode

+++
*** Corrections and actions menu can be optionally bound to 'mouse-3'.
When Flyspell mode highlights a word as misspelled, you can click on
it to display a menu of possible corrections and actions.  You can now
easily bind this menu to 'down-mouse-3' (usually the right mouse button)
instead of 'mouse-2' (the default) by customizing the new user option
'flyspell-use-mouse-3-for-menu'.

---
*** The current dictionary is now displayed in the minor mode lighter.
Clicking the dictionary name changes the current dictionary.

** Time

---
*** 'display-time-world' has been renamed to 'world-clock'.
'world-clock' creates a buffer with an updating time display using
several time zones.  It is hoped that the new names are more
discoverable.

The following commands have been renamed:

  'display-time-world'         to 'world-clock'
  'display-time-world-mode'    to 'world-clock-mode'
  'display-time-world-display' to 'world-clock-display'
  'display-time-world-timer'   to 'world-clock-update'

The following user options have been renamed:

  'display-time-world-list'         to 'world-clock-list'
  'display-time-world-time-format'  to 'world-clock-time-format'
  'display-time-world-buffer-name'  to 'world-clock-buffer-name'
  'display-time-world-timer-enable' to 'world-clock-timer-enable'
  'display-time-world-timer-second' to 'world-clock-timer-second'

The old names are now obsolete.

** D-Bus

+++
*** Property values can be typed explicitly.
'dbus-register-property' and 'dbus-set-property' accept now optional
type symbols.  Both functions propagate D-Bus errors.

+++
*** Registered properties can have the new access type ':write'.

+++
*** In case of problems, handlers can emit proper D-Bus error messages now.

+++
*** D-Bus errors, which have been converted from incoming D-Bus error
messages, contain the error name of that message now.

+++
*** D-Bus messages can be monitored with the new command 'dbus-monitor'.

+++
*** D-Bus events have changed their internal structure.
They carry now the destination and the error-name of an event.  They
also keep the type information of their arguments. Use the
'dbus-event-*' accessor functions.

** CPerl Mode

---
*** New face 'perl-heredoc', used for heredoc elements.

---
*** The command 'cperl-set-style' offers the new value "PBP".
This value customizes Emacs to use the style recommended in Damian
Conway's book "Perl Best Practices" for indentation and formatting
of conditionals.

** Abbrev mode

+++
*** Emacs can now suggest to use an abbrev based on text you type.
A new user option, 'abbrev-suggest', enables the new abbrev suggestion
feature.  When enabled, if a user manually types a piece of text that
could have saved enough typing by using an abbrev, a hint will be
displayed in the echo area, mentioning the abbrev that could have been
used instead.

** Octave Mode

+++
*** Line continuations in double-quoted strings now use a backslash.
Typing 'C-M-j' (bound to 'octave-indent-new-comment-line') now follows
the behavior introduced in Octave 3.8 of using a backslash as a line
continuation marker within double-quoted strings, and an ellipsis
everywhere else.

** Repeat

+++
*** New transient mode 'repeat-mode' to allow shorter key sequences.
You can type 'C-x u u' instead of 'C-x u C-x u' to undo many changes,
'C-x o o' instead of 'C-x o C-x o' to switch several windows,
'C-x { { } } ^ ^ v v' to resize the selected window interactively,
'M-g n n p p' to navigate next-error matches.  Any other key exits
transient mode and then is executed normally.  'repeat-exit-key'
defines an additional key to exit mode like 'isearch-exit' (RET).


* New Modes and Packages in Emacs 28.1

** Lisp Data mode
The new command 'lisp-data-mode' enables a major mode for buffers
composed of Lisp symbolic expressions that do not form a computer
program.  The ".dir-locals.el" file is automatically set to use this
mode, as are other data files produced by Emacs.

** hierarchy.el
It's a library to create, query, navigate and display hierarchy structures.

** New themes 'modus-vivendi' and 'modus-operandi'.
These themes are designed to conform with the highest standard for
color-contrast accessibility (WCAG AAA).  You can load either of them
using 'M-x customize-themes' or 'load-theme' from your init file.
Consult the Modus Themes Info manual for more information on the user
options they provide.

** Dictionary mode
This is a mode for searching a RFC 2229 dictionary server.
'dictionary' opens a buffer for starting operations.
'dictionary-search' performs a lookup for a word.  It also supports a
'dictionary-tooltip-mode' which performs a lookup of the word under
the mouse in 'dictionary-tooltip-dictionary' (which must be customized
first).


* Incompatible Editing Changes in Emacs 28.1

** The 'M-o' ('facemenu-keymap') global binding has been removed.

** The 'M-o M-s' and 'M-o M-S' global bindings have been removed.
Use 'M-x center-line' and 'M-x center-paragraph' instead.

** The 'M-o M-o' global binding have been removed.
Use 'M-x font-lock-fontify-block' instead.

** In 'f90-mode', the backslash character ('\') no longer escapes.
For about a decade, the backslash character has no longer had a
special escape syntax in Fortran F90.  To get the old behaviour back,
say something like:

    (modify-syntax-entry ?\\ "\\" f90-mode-syntax-table)

** In 'nroff-mode', 'center-line' is now bound to 'M-o M-s'.
The original key binding was 'M-s', which interfered with I-search,
since the latter uses 'M-s' as a prefix key of the search prefix map.

** 'vc-print-branch-log' shows the change log for BRANCH from its root
directory instead of the default directory.


* Incompatible Lisp Changes in Emacs 28.1

** 'pcomplete-ignore-case' is now an obsolete alias of 'completion-ignore-case'.

** 'completions-annotations' face is not used when the caller puts own face.
This affects the suffix specified by completion 'annotation-function'.

** 'set-process-buffer' now updates the process mark.
The mark will be set to point to the end of the new buffer.

+++
** Some properties from completion tables are now preserved.
If 'minibuffer-allow-text-properties' is non-nil, doing completion
over a table of strings with properties will no longer remove all the
properties before returning.  This affects things like 'completing-read'.

** 'equal' no longer examines some contents of window configurations.
Instead, it considers window configurations to be equal only if they
are 'eq'.  To compare contents, use 'compare-window-configurations'
instead.  This change helps fix a bug in 'sxhash-equal', which returned
incorrect hashes for window configurations and some other objects.

** When its first argument is a string, 'make-text-button' no longer
modifies the string's text properties; instead, it uses and returns
a copy of the string.  This helps avoid trouble when strings are
shared or constants.

+++
** Temporary buffers no longer run certain buffer hooks.
The macros 'with-temp-buffer' and 'with-temp-file' no longer run the
hooks 'kill-buffer-hook', 'kill-buffer-query-functions', and
'buffer-list-update-hook' for the temporary buffers they create.  This
avoids slowing them down when a lot of these hooks are defined.

** New face 'child-frame-border' and frame parameter 'child-frame-border-width'.
The face and width of child frames borders can now be determined
separately from those of normal frames.  To minimize backward
incompatibility, child frames without a 'child-frame-border-width'
parameter will fall back to using 'internal-border-width'.  However,
the new 'child-frame-border' face does constitute a breaking change
since child frames' borders no longer use the 'internal-border' face.

---
** The obsolete function 'thread-alive-p' has been removed.

** 'dns-query' now consistently uses Lisp integers to represent integers.
Formerly it made an exception for integer components of SOA records,
because SOA serial numbers can exceed fixnum ranges on 32-bit platforms.
Emacs now supports bignums so this old glitch is no longer needed.

---
** The new function 'dns-query-asynchronous' has been added.
It takes the same parameters as 'dns-query', but adds a callback
parameter.

** The Lisp variables 'previous-system-messages-locale' and
'previous-system-time-locale' have been removed, as they were created
by mistake and were not useful to Lisp code.

---
** Loading 'generic-x' unconditionally loads all modes.
The user option `generic-extras-enable-list' is now obsolete, and
setting it has no effect.

---
** The 'load-dangerous-libraries' variable is now obsolete.
It was used to allow loading Lisp libraries compiled by XEmacs, a
modified version of Emacs which is no longer actively maintained.
This is no longer supported, and setting this variable has no effect.

+++
** The macro 'with-displayed-buffer-window' is now obsolete.
Use macro 'with-current-buffer-window' with action alist entry 'body-function'.

---
** The metamail.el library is now marked obsolete.

---
** Some obsolete variable and function aliases in dbus.el have been removed.
In Emacs 24.3, the variable 'dbus-event-error-hooks' was renamed to
'dbus-event-error-functions' and the function
'dbus-call-method-non-blocking' was renamed to 'dbus-call-method'.
The old names, which were kept as obsolete aliases of the new names,

** The variable 'keyboard-type' is obsolete and not dynamically scoped any more.


* Lisp Changes in Emacs 28.1

+++
** New function 'always'.
This is identical to 'ignore', but returns t instead.

+++
** New forms to declare how completion should happen has been added.
'(declare (completion PREDICATE))' can be used as a general predicate
to say whether the command should be present when completing with
'M-x TAB'.  '(declare (modes MODE...))' can be used as a short-hand
way of saying that the command should be present when completing from
buffers in major modes derived from MODE..., or, if it's a minor mode,
whether that minor mode is enabled in the current buffer.

+++
** The 'interactive' syntax has been extended to allow listing applicable modes.
Forms like '(interactive "p" dired-mode)' can be used to annotate the
commands as being applicable for modes derived from 'dired-mode',
or if the mode is a minor mode, that the current buffer has that
minor mode activated.  Note that using this form will create byte code
that is not compatible with byte code in previous Emacs versions.

+++
** New buffer-local variable 'local-minor-modes'.
This permanently buffer-local variable holds a list of currently
enabled non-global minor modes in the current buffer (as a list of
symbols).

+++
** New variable 'global-minor-modes'.
This variable holds a list of currently enabled global minor modes (as
a list of symbols).

+++
** 'define-minor-mode'  now takes an :interactive argument.
This can be used for specifying which modes this minor mode is meant
for, or to make the new minor mode non-interactive.  The default value
is t.

+++
** 'define-derived-mode' now takes an :interactive argument.
This can be used to control whether the defined mode is a command
or not, and is useful when defining commands that aren't meant to be
used by users directly.

** The 'values' variable is now obsolete.

---
** New variable 'indent-line-ignored-functions'.
This allows modes to cycle through a set of indentation functions
appropriate for those modes.

** New function 'garbage-collect-maybe' to trigger GC early.

---
** 'defvar' detects the error of defining a variable currently lexically bound.
Such mixes are always signs that the outer lexical binding was an
error and should have used dynamic binding instead.

+++
** New completion function 'affixation-function' to add prefix/suffix.
It accepts a list of completions and should return a list where
each element is a list with three elements: a completion,
a prefix string, and a suffix string.

+++
** 'read-char-from-minibuffer' and 'y-or-n-p' support 'help-form'.
If you bind 'help-form' to a non-nil value while calling these functions,
then pressing 'C-h' ('help-char') causes the function to evaluate 'help-form'
and display the result.

---
** New variables 'read-char-choice-use-read-key' and 'y-or-n-p-use-read-key'.
When non-nil, then functions 'read-char-choice' and 'y-or-n-p' (respectively)
use the function 'read-key' to read a character instead of using the minibuffer.

+++
** 'set-window-configuration' now takes an optional 'dont-set-frame'
parameter which, when non-nil, instructs the function not to select
the frame recorded in the configuration.

+++
** 'define-globalized-minor-mode' now takes a ':predicate' parameter.
This can be used to control which major modes the minor mode should be
used in.

+++
** 'truncate-string-ellipsis' now uses '…' by default.
Modes that use 'truncate-string-to-width' with non-nil, non-string
argument ELLIPSIS, will now indicate truncation using '…' when
the selected frame can display it, and using "..." otherwise.

+++
** New command 'make-directory-autoloads'.
This does the same as the old command 'update-directory-autoloads',
but has different semantics: Instead of passing in the output file via
the dynamically bound 'generated-autoload-file' variable, the output
file is now a explicit parameter.

+++
** New function 'string-search'.
This function takes two string parameters and returns the position of
the first instance of the former string in the latter.

+++
** New function 'string-replace'.
This function works along the line of 'replace-regexp-in-string', but
matching on strings instead of regexps, and does not change the global
match state.

+++
** New function 'process-lines-ignore-status'.
This is like 'process-lines', but does not signal an error if the
return status is non-zero.  'process-lines-handling-status' has also
been added, and takes a callback to handle the return status.

---
** 'ascii' is now a coding system alias for 'us-ascii'.

+++
** New function 'file-backup-file-names'.
This function returns the list of file names of all the backup files
of its file argument.

+++
** New utility function 'directory-empty-p'.
This predicate tests whether a given file name is an accessible
directory and whether it contains no other directories or files.

+++
** 'directory-files' now takes an additional COUNT parameter.
The parameter makes 'directory-files' return COUNT first file names
from a directory.  If MATCH is also given, the function will return
first COUNT file names that match the expression.  The same COUNT
parameter has been added to 'directory-files-and-attributes'.

+++
** The 'count-lines' function now takes an optional parameter to
ignore invisible lines.

---
** 'count-words' now crosses field boundaries.
Originally, 'count-words' would stop counting at the first field
boundary it encountered; now it keeps counting all the way to the
region's (or buffer's) end.

---
** New function 'custom-add-choice'.
This function can be used by modes to add elements to the
'choice' customization type of a variable.

+++
** New function 'file-modes-number-to-symbolic' to convert a numeric
file mode specification into symbolic form.

** New macro 'dlet' to dynamically bind variables.

** The variable 'force-new-style-backquotes' has been removed.
This removes the final remaining trace of old-style backquotes.

** Changes in handling dynamic modules

*** The module header 'emacs-module.h' now contains type aliases
'emacs_function' and 'emacs_finalizer' for module functions and
finalizers, respectively.

*** Module functions can now be made interactive.
Use 'make_interactive' to give a module function an interactive
specification.

*** Module functions can now install an optional finalizer that is
called when the function object is garbage-collected.  Use
'set_function_finalizer' to set the finalizer and
'get_function_finalizer' to retrieve it.

*** Modules can now open a channel to an existing pipe process using
the new module function 'open_channel'.  Modules can use this
functionality to asynchronously send data back to Emacs.

*** A new module API 'make_unibyte_string' is provided.
It can be used to create Lisp strings with arbitrary byte sequences
(a.k.a. "raw bytes").

** 'file-modes', 'set-file-modes', and 'set-file-times' now have an
optional argument specifying whether to follow symbolic links.

** 'parse-time-string' can now parse ISO 8601 format strings,
such as "2020-01-15T16:12:21-08:00".

---
** The new function 'decoded-time-period' has been added.
It interprets a decoded time structure as a period and returns the
equivalent period in seconds.

+++
** The new function 'dom-remove-attribute' has been added.

+++
** The new function 'dom-print' has been added.

---
** 'make-network-process', 'make-serial-process' ':coding' behavior change.
Previously, passing ':coding nil' to either of these functions would
override any non-nil binding for 'coding-system-for-read' and
'coding-system-for-write'.  For consistency with 'make-process' and
'make-pipe-process', passing ':coding nil' is now ignored.  No code in
Emacs depended on the previous behavior; if you really want the
process' coding-system to be nil, use 'set-process-coding-system'
after the process has been created, or pass in ':coding '(nil nil)'.

+++
** 'open-network-stream' now accepts a ':coding' argument.
This allows specifying the coding systems used by a network process
for encoding and decoding without having to bind
'coding-system-for-{read,write}' or call 'set-process-coding-system'.

+++
** 'open-network-stream' can now take a ':capability-command' that's a function.
The function is called with the greeting from the server as its only
parameter, and allows sending different TLS capability commands to the
server based on that greeting.

+++
** 'open-gnutls-stream' now also accepts a ':coding' argument.

+++
** New user option 'process-file-return-signal-string'.
It controls, whether 'process-file' returns a string when a remote
process is interrupted by a signal.

+++
** The behavior of 'format-spec' is now closer to that of 'format'.
In order for the two functions to behave more consistently,
'format-spec' now pads and truncates based on string width rather than
length, and also supports format specifications that include a
truncating precision field, such as "%.2a".

+++
** 'format-spec' now takes an optional SPLIT parameter.
If non-nil, 'format-spec' will split the resulting string into a list
of strings, based on where the format specs (and expansions) were.

---
** New function 'color-values-from-color-spec'.
This can be used to parse RGB color specs in several formats and
convert them to a list '(R G B)' of primary color values.

---
** User option 'uniquify-buffer-name-style' can now be a function.
This user option can be one of the predefined styles or a function to
personalize the uniquified buffer name.

+++
** New variable 'tty-menu-calls-mouse-position-function'.
This controls whether 'mouse-position-function' is called by functions
that retrieve the mouse position when that happens during TTY menu
handling.  Lisp programs that set 'mouse-position-function' should
also set this variable non-nil if they are compatible with the tty
menu handling.

+++
** 'inhibit-nul-byte-detection' is renamed to 'inhibit-null-byte-detection'.

** Byte compiler

+++
*** New byte-compiler check for missing dynamic variable declarations.
It is meant as an (experimental) aid for converting Emacs Lisp code
to lexical binding, where dynamic (special) variables bound in one
file can affect code in another.  For details, see the manual section
"(Elisp) Converting to Lexical Binding".

+++
*** 'byte-recompile-directory' can now compile symlinked ".el" files.
This is achieved by giving a non-nil FOLLOW-SYMLINKS parameter.

*** The byte-compiler now warns about too wide documentation strings.
By default, it will warn if a documentation string is wider than the
largest of 80 characters or 'fill-column'.  This is controlled by the
new user option 'byte-compile-docstring-max-column'.

+++
*** 'byte-compile-file' optional argument LOAD is now obsolete.
To load the file after byte-compiling, add a call to 'load' from Lisp
or use 'M-x emacs-lisp-byte-compile-and-load' interactively.

---
** 'unload-feature' now also tries to undo additions to buffer-local hooks.

---
** Some functions are no longer considered safe by 'unsafep':
'replace-regexp-in-string', 'catch', 'throw', 'error', 'signal'
and 'play-sound-file'.

+++
** New variable 'print-integers-as-characters' modifies integer printing.
If this variable is non-nil, character syntax is used for printing
numbers when this makes sense, such as '?A' for 65.

+++
** New error 'remote-file-error', a subcategory of 'file-error'.
It is signaled if a remote file operation fails due to internal
reasons, and could block Emacs.  It does not replace 'file-error'
signals for the usual cases.  Timers, process filters and process
functions, which run remote file operations, shall protect themselves
against this error.

If such an error occurs, please report this as bug via 'M-x report-emacs-bug'.
Until it is solved you could ignore such errors by performing

    (setq debug-ignored-errors (cons 'remote-file-error debug-ignored-errors))

+++
** The error 'ftp-error' belongs also to category 'remote-file-error'.

+++
** Buffers can now be created with certain hooks disabled.
The functions 'get-buffer-create' and 'generate-new-buffer' accept a
new optional argument INHIBIT-BUFFER-HOOKS.  If non-nil, the new
buffer does not run the hooks 'kill-buffer-hook',
'kill-buffer-query-functions', and 'buffer-list-update-hook'.  This
avoids slowing down internal or temporary buffers that are never
presented to users or passed on to other applications.

---
** 'start-process-shell-command' and 'start-file-process-shell-command'
do not support the old calling conventions any longer.

** Functions operating on local file names now check that the file names
don't contain any NUL bytes.  This avoids subtle bugs caused by
silently using only the part of the file name until the first NUL byte.

** New coding-systems for EBCDIC variants.
New coding-systems 'ibm256', 'ibm273', 'ibm274', 'ibm277', 'ibm278',
'ibm280', 'ibm281', 'ibm284', 'ibm285', 'ibm290', 'ibm297'.  These are
variants of the EBCDIC encoding tailored to some European and Japanese
locales.  They are also available as aliases 'ebcdic-cp-*' (e.g.,
'ebcdic-cp-fi' for the Finnish variant 'ibm278'), and 'cp2xx' (e.g.,
'cp278' for 'ibm278').  There are also new charsets 'ibm2xx' to
support these coding-systems.

** The JSON functions 'json-serialize', 'json-insert',
'json-parse-string', and 'json-parse-buffer' now implement some of the
semantics of RFC 8259 instead of the earlier RFC 4627.  In particular,
these functions now accept top-level JSON values that are neither
arrays nor objects.


* Changes in Emacs 28.1 on Non-Free Operating Systems

---
** On macOS, Xwidget is now supported.
If Emacs was built with xwidget support, you can access the embedded
webkit browser with 'M-x xwidget-webkit-browse-url'.  Viewing two
instances of xwidget webkit is not supported.

*** Downloading files from xwidget-webkit is now supported.
The new variable 'xwidget-webkit-download-dir' says where to download to.

*** New functions for xwidget-webkit mode
'xwidget-webkit-clone-and-split-below',
'xwidget-webkit-clone-and-split-right'.

*** New variable 'xwidget-webkit-enable-plugins'.

+++
** On macOS, Emacs can now load dynamic modules with a ".dylib" suffix.
'module-file-suffix' now has the value ".dylib" on macOS, but the
".so" suffix is supported as well.

+++
** On MS-Windows, Emacs can now toggle the IME.
A new function 'w32-set-ime-open-status' can now be used to disable
and enable the MS-Windows native Input Method Editor (IME) at run
time.  A companion function 'w32-get-ime-open-status' returns the
current IME activation status.

+++
** On MS-Windows, Emacs can now use the native image API to display images.
Emacs can now use the MS-Windows GDI+ library to load and display
images in JPEG, PNG, GIF and TIFF formats.  This support is enabled
unless Emacs was configured '--without-native-image-api'.

This feature is experimental, and needs to be turned on to be used.
To turn this on, set the variable 'w32-use-native-image-API' to a
non-nil value.  Please report any bugs you find while using the native
image API via 'M-x report-emacs-bug'.

---
** The user option 'make-pointer-invisible' is now honored on macOS.

--
** On macOS, 's-<left>' and 's-<right>' are now bound to
'move-beginning-of-line' and 'move-end-of-line' respectively.  The commands
to select previous/next frame are still bound to 's-~' and 's-`'.
