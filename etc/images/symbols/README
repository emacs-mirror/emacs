How I made these icons: I made them with Figma, and exported them into
SVG. I made the shapes with vectors (SVG paths) rather than strokes,
merged all the shapes into a single shape with union operation, and
stripped filling attributes from the SVG files. This way the icons can
be colored like normal text! I'm not exactly sure how it works, but as
long as the icon uses SVG path, and there is only one path in the
file, and there is no filling attributes, the icons can be colored as
text.

FWIW, this is the command I used to strip filling attributes:

sed -i 's/fill="none"//g' <file>
sed -i 's/fill="black"//g' <file>

Naming: Use underscore to separate styles, dash are considered normal
character so you can use it for names. End with the intended optical
size for the icon.

There should also be an order for all the keywords. Right now we have
directions (left/right), circle, fill, and optical size. Among them,
the order should be

1. direction
2. circle
3. fill
4. size

E.g., arrow_right_circle_fill_16.



Every time you modify the SVG icons, please use the ImageMagick
`convert' utility to convert them to PBM icons, for the sake of
Emacsen that cannot display SVG images.



The behavior described above for setting the foreground color to match
the text has changed.  It must now be set to `currentcolor', so the
above sed commands are now:

sed -i 's/fill="none"/fill="currentcolor"/g' <file>
sed -i 's/fill="black"/fille="currentcolor"/g' <file>
