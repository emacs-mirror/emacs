* Changes in Emacs 30.2
Emacs 30.2 is a bug-fix release with no new features.


* Installation Changes in Emacs 30.1

** Native compilation is now enabled by default.
'configure' will enable the Emacs Lisp native compiler, so long as
libgccjit is present and functional on the system.  To disable native
compilation, configure Emacs with the option:

    ./configure --with-native-compilation=no

** Emacs has been ported to the Android operating system.
This requires Emacs to be compiled on another computer.  The Android
NDK, SDK, and a suitable Java compiler must also be installed.

See the file "java/INSTALL" for more details.

** Native JSON support is now always available; libjansson is no longer used.
No external library is required.  The '--with-json' configure option has
been removed.  'json-available-p' now always returns non-nil and is only
kept for compatibility.

** Emacs now defaults to the ossaudio library for sound on NetBSD and OpenBSD.
Previously, configure used ALSA libraries if installed on the system
when configured '--with-sound=yes' (which is the default), with fallback
to libossaudio.  The libossaudio library included with the base system
is now used even if ALSA is found to avoid relying on external packages
and to resolve potential incompatibilities between GNU/Linux and *BSD
versions of ALSA.  Use '--with-sound=alsa' to build with ALSA on these
operating systems instead.

** New configuration option '--disable-gc-mark-trace'.
This disables the GC mark trace buffer for about 5% better garbage
collection performance.  Doing so may make it more difficult for Emacs
developers to help finding GC-related bugs that you run into, which is
why the mark trace buffer is enabled by default.


* Startup Changes in Emacs 30.1

** On GNU/Linux, Emacs is now the default application for 'org-protocol'.
Org mode provides a way to quickly capture bookmarks, notes, and links
using 'emacsclient':

    emacsclient "org-protocol://store-link?url=URL&title=TITLE"

Previously, users had to manually configure their GNU/Linux desktop
environment to open 'org-protocol' links in Emacs.  These links should
now open in Emacs automatically, as the "emacsclient.desktop" file now
arranges for Emacs to be the default application for the 'org-protocol'
URI scheme.  See the Org mode manual, Info node "(org) Protocols" for
more details.

** New variable lets Lisp code read emacsclient arguments.
When '--eval' is passed to emacsclient and Emacs is evaluating each
argument, the new variable 'server-eval-args-left' is set to those
arguments not yet evaluated.  It can be used by Lisp code to 'pop'
arguments and process them by the function called in the '--eval'
expression, which is useful when those arguments contain arbitrary
characters that otherwise might require elaborate and error-prone
escaping (to protect them from the shell).


* Incompatible Changes in Emacs 30.1

** Tree-Sitter modes are now declared as submodes of the non-TS modes.
In order to help the use of those Tree-Sitter modes, they are now
declared to have the corresponding non-Tree-Sitter mode as an
additional parent.
This way, things like ".dir-locals.el" settings, and YASnippet
collections of snippets automatically apply to the new Tree-Sitter modes.

Note that those modes still do not inherit from the non-TS mode, so
configuration settings installed via mode hooks are not affected.

Loading a Tree-Sitter mode (such as by using 'M-x load-library' or with
'M-x load-file') by default causes the corresponding non-Tree-Sitter
mode be remapped to the Tree-Sitter mode.  This remapping affects
visiting files for which 'auto-mode-alist' specifies a non-Tree-Sitter
mode, and also affects mode-specification cookies on the first line of a
file and mode specifications in file- and directory-local variables.  To
revert to using a non-Tree-Sitter mode, reload the corresponding mode
file anew.  To prevent file loading from turning on Tree-Sitter mode
when 'auto-mode-alist' or the file/directory-local variables specify a
non-Tree-Sitter mode, customize the user option 'major-mode-remap-alist'
to specify that a non-Tree-Sitter mode is "remapped" to itself.  For
example:

    (add-to-list 'major-mode-remap-alist '(c-mode))

specifies that C Mode should not be remapped to 'c-ts-mode' even if and
when 'c-ts-mode' is loaded.  Conversely,

    (add-to-list 'major-mode-remap-alist '(c-mode . c-ts-mode))

tells Emacs to always invoke 'c-ts-mode' whenever 'c-mode' is
requested, either by 'auto-mode-alist' or by file/directory-local
variables.

We recommend using 'major-mode-remap-alist' to express your preferences
for using Tree-Sitter or non-Tree-Sitter modes for files for which both
variants of major modes are available, because that variable overrides
the remapping Emacs might decide to perform as result of loading Lisp
files and features.

** Mouse wheel events should now always be 'wheel-up/down/left/right'.
At those places where the old 'mouse-4/5/6/7' events could still occur
(i.e., X11 input in the absence of XInput2, and 'xterm-mouse-mode'),
we remap them to the corresponding 'wheel-up/down/left/right' event,
according to the new user option 'mouse-wheel-buttons'.
The old variables 'mouse-wheel-up-event', 'mouse-wheel-down-event',
'mouse-wheel-left-event', and 'mouse-wheel-right-event' are thereby
obsolete.

** 'completion-auto-help' now affects 'icomplete-in-buffer'.
Previously, 'completion-auto-help' mostly affected only minibuffer
completion.  Now, if 'completion-auto-help' has the value 'lazy', then
Icomplete's in-buffer display of possible completions will only appear
after the 'completion-at-point' command has been invoked twice, and if
'completion-auto-help' is nil, then Icomplete's in-buffer display is
completely suppressed.  Thus, if you use 'icomplete-in-buffer', ensure
'completion-auto-help' is not customized to 'lazy' or nil.

** The "*Completions*" buffer now always accompanies 'icomplete-in-buffer'.
Previously, it was not consistent whether the "*Completions*" buffer would
appear when using 'icomplete-in-buffer'.  Now the "*Completions*" buffer
and Icomplete's in-buffer display of possible completions always
appear together.  If you would prefer to see only Icomplete's
in-buffer display, and not the "*Completions*" buffer, you can add this
to your init file:

    (advice-add 'completion-at-point :after #'minibuffer-hide-completions)

** The default process filter was rewritten in native code.
The round-trip through the Lisp function
'internal-default-process-filter' is skipped when the process filter is
the default one.  It is reimplemented in native code, reducing GC churn.
To undo this change, set 'fast-read-process-output' to nil.

** Network Security Manager now warns about 3DES by default.
This cypher is no longer recommended owing to a major vulnerability
disclosed in 2016, and its small 112 bit key size.  Emacs now warns
about its use also when 'network-security-level' is set to 'medium'
(the default).  See 'network-security-protocol-checks'.

** Network Security Manager now warns about <2048 bits in DH key exchange.
Emacs used to warn for ephemeral Diffie-Hellman (DHE) key exchanges with
prime numbers smaller than 1024 bits.  Since more servers now support
it, this number has been bumped to 2048 bits.

** URL now never sends user email addresses in HTTP requests.
Emacs never sent email addresses by default, but it used to be
possible to customize 'url-privacy-level' so that the user's email
address was sent along in HTTP requests.  This feature has now been
removed, as it was considered more dangerous than useful.  RFC 9110
(§ 10.1.2) also recommends against it.  The user option
'url-personal-mail-address' is now also obsolete.

To send an email address in the header of individual HTTP requests,
see the variable 'url-request-extra-headers'.

** 'pixel-scroll-precision-mode' sets 'make-cursor-line-fully-visible'.
'pixel-scroll-precision-mode' sets 'make-cursor-line-fully-visible' to a
nil value globally, since the usual requirement of the Emacs display to
make the cursor line fully visible contradicts the smooth scrolling
expectations.


* Changes in Emacs 30.1

** Fix shell injection vulnerability in man.el (CVE-2025-1244).
We urge all users to upgrade immediately.

** New user option 'trusted-content' to allow potentially dangerous features.
This option lists those files and directories whose content Emacs should
consider as sufficiently trusted to run any part of the code contained
therein even without any explicit user request.

For example, Flymake's backend for Emacs Lisp consults this option
and disables itself with an "untrusted content" warning if the file
is not listed.

Emacs Lisp authors should note that a major or minor mode must never set
this option to the ':all' value.

This option is used to fix CVE-2024-53920.  See below for details.

** Emacs now supports Unicode Standard version 15.1.

** Emacs now comes with Org v9.7.
See the file "etc/ORG-NEWS" for user-visible changes in Org.

** Improved support for touchscreen devices.
On systems that understand them (at present X, Android, PGTK, and
MS-Windows), many touch screen gestures are now implemented and
translated into mouse or gesture events, and support for tapping tool
bar buttons and opening menus has been added.  Countless packages, such
as Dired and Custom, have been adjusted to better understand touch
screen input.

** Support for styled underline face attributes.
These are implemented as new values of the 'style' attribute in a face
underline specification, 'double-line', 'dots', and 'dashes', and are
available on GUI systems.  If your terminal's termcap or terminfo
database entry defines the 'Su' or 'Smulx' capability, Emacs will also
emit the prescribed escape sequence to render faces with such styles on
TTY frames.

** Support for underline colors on TTY frames.
Colors specified in the underline face will now also be displayed on TTY
frames on terminals that support the 'Su' or 'Smulx' capabilities.

** Modeline elements can now be right-aligned.
Anything following the symbol 'mode-line-format-right-align' in
'mode-line-format' will be right-aligned.  Exactly where it is
right-aligned to is controlled by the new user option
'mode-line-right-align-edge'.

** X selection requests are now handled much faster and asynchronously.
This means it should be less necessary to disable the likes of
'select-active-regions' when Emacs is running over a slow network
connection.

** Emacs now updates invisible frames that are made visible by a compositor.
If an invisible or an iconified frame is shown to the user by the
compositing manager, Emacs will now redisplay such a frame even though
'frame-visible-p' returns nil or 'icon' for it.  This can happen, for
example, as part of preview for iconified frames.

** Most file notification backends detect unmounting of a watched filesystem.
The only exception is w32notify.

** The ':map' property of images is now recomputed when image is transformed.
Images with clickable maps now work as expected after you run commands
such as 'image-increase-size', 'image-decrease-size', 'image-rotate',
'image-flip-horizontally', and 'image-flip-vertically'.
Set the new user option 'image-recompute-map-p' to nil to prevent Emacs
from recomputing image maps.

** Minibuffer and Completions

*** New commands 'previous-line-completion' and 'next-line-completion'.
Bound to '<up>' and '<down>' arrow keys, respectively, they navigate
the "*Completions*" buffer vertically by lines, wrapping at the
top/bottom when 'completion-auto-wrap' is non-nil.

*** New user option 'minibuffer-visible-completions'.
When customized to non-nil, you can use arrow keys in the minibuffer
to navigate the completions displayed in the "*Completions*" window.
Typing 'RET' selects the highlighted candidate.  'C-g' hides the
completions window.  When the completions window is not visible,
then all these keys have their usual meaning in the minibuffer.
This option is supported for in-buffer completion as well.

*** Selected completion candidates are deselected on typing.
When you type at the minibuffer prompt, the current completion
candidate will be un-highlighted, and point in the "*Completions*" window
will be moved off that candidate.  'minibuffer-choose-completion'
('M-RET') will still choose a previously-selected completion
candidate, but the new command 'minibuffer-choose-completion-or-exit'
(bound to 'RET' by 'minibuffer-visible-completions') will exit with
the minibuffer contents instead.  This deselection behavior can be
controlled with the new user option 'completion-auto-deselect', which
is t by default.

*** New value 'historical' for user option 'completions-sort'.
When 'completions-sort' is set to 'historical', completion candidates
will be first sorted alphabetically, and then re-sorted by their order
in the minibuffer history, with more recent candidates appearing first.

*** 'completion-category-overrides' supports more metadata.
The new supported completion properties are 'cycle-sort-function',
'display-sort-function', 'annotation-function', 'affixation-function',
and 'group-function'.  You can now customize them for any category in
'completion-category-overrides' that will override the properties
defined in completion metadata.

*** 'completion-extra-properties' supports more metadata.
The new supported completion properties are 'category',
'group-function', 'display-sort-function', and 'cycle-sort-function'.

** Windows

*** New command 'toggle-window-dedicated'.
This makes it easy to interactively mark a specific window as
dedicated, so it won't be reused by 'display-buffer'.  This can be
useful for complicated window setups.  It is bound to 'C-x w d'
globally.

*** "d" in the mode line now indicates that the window is dedicated.
Windows have always been able to be dedicated to a specific buffer;
see 'window-dedicated-p'.  Now the mode line indicates the dedicated
status of a window, with "d" appearing in the mode line if a window is
dedicated and "D" if the window is strongly dedicated.  This indicator
appears before the buffer name, and after the buffer modification and
remote buffer indicators (usually "---" together).

*** New action alist entry 'some-window' for 'display-buffer'.
It specifies which window 'display-buffer-use-some-window' should prefer.
For example, when 'display-buffer-base-action' is customized to
'(nil . ((some-window . mru)))', then a buffer will be displayed
in the same most recently used window from consecutive calls of
'display-buffer' (in a configuration with more than two windows).

*** New action alist entry 'category' for 'display-buffer'.
If the caller of 'display-buffer' passes '(category . symbol)'
in its 'action' argument, you can match the displayed buffer
by adding '(category . symbol)' to the condition part of
'display-buffer-alist' entries.

*** New action alist entry 'post-command-select-window' for 'display-buffer'.
It specifies whether the window of the displayed buffer should be
selected or deselected at the end of executing the current command.

*** New variable 'window-restore-killed-buffer-windows'.
It specifies how 'set-window-configuration' and 'window-state-put'
should proceed with windows whose buffer was killed after the
corresponding configuration or state was recorded.

*** New variable 'window-point-context-set-function'.
It can be used to set a context for window point in all windows by
'window-point-context-set' before calling 'current-window-configuration'
and 'window-state-get'.  Then later another new variable
'window-point-context-use-function' can be used by
'window-point-context-use' after 'set-window-configuration' and
'window-state-put' to restore positions of window points
according to the context stored in a window parameter.

*** New functions 'set-window-cursor-type' and 'window-cursor-type'.
'set-window-cursor-type' sets a per-window cursor type, and
'window-cursor-type' queries this setting for a given window.  Windows
are always created with a 'window-cursor-type' of t, which means to
consult the variable 'cursor-type' as before.

*** The user option 'display-comint-buffer-action' is now obsolete.
You can use a '(category . comint)' condition in 'display-buffer-alist'
to match buffers displayed by comint-related commands.  Another
user option 'display-tex-shell-buffer-action' is obsolete too
for which you can use '(category . tex-shell)'.

** Tool bars

*** Tool bars can now be placed on the bottom on more systems.
The 'tool-bar-position' frame parameter can be set to 'bottom' on all
window systems other than macOS and GNUstep (Nextstep).

*** New global minor mode 'modifier-bar-mode'.
When this minor mode is enabled, the tool bar displays buttons
representing modifier keys.  Clicking on these buttons applies the
corresponding modifiers to the next input event.

*** New user option 'tool-bar-always-show-default'.
When non-nil, the tool bar at the top of a frame does not show buffer
local customization of the tool bar.  The default value is nil.

** Tab Bars and Tab Lines

*** New user option 'tab-bar-select-restore-context'.
It uses 'window-point-context-set' to save contexts where
window points were located before switching away from the tab,
and 'window-point-context-use' to restore positions of window
points after switching back to that tab.

*** New user option 'tab-bar-select-restore-windows'.
It defines what to do with windows whose buffer was killed since the tab
was last selected.  By default it displays a placeholder buffer
with the name " *Old buffer <name>*" that provides information about
the name of the killed buffer that was displayed in that window.

*** New user option 'tab-bar-tab-name-format-functions'.
It can be used to add, remove and reorder functions that change the
appearance of every tab on the tab bar.

*** New hook 'tab-bar-tab-post-select-functions'.

*** New keymap 'tab-bar-mode-map'.
By default it contains a keybinding 'C-TAB' to switch tabs, but only
when 'C-TAB' is not bound globally.  You can unbind it if it conflicts
with 'C-TAB' in other modes.

*** New keymap 'tab-line-mode-map'.
By default it contains keybindings for switching tabs: 'C-x <left>',
'C-x <right>', 'C-x C-<left>', 'C-x C-<right>'.  You can unbind them if
you want to use these keys for the commands 'previous-buffer' and
'next-buffer'.

*** Default list of tab-line tabs is changed to support a fixed order.
This means that 'tab-line-tabs-fixed-window-buffers', the new default
tabs function, is like the previous 'tab-line-tabs-window-buffers' where
both of them show only buffers that were previously displayed in the
window.  But the difference is that the new function always keeps the
original order of buffers on the tab line, even after switching between
these buffers.  You can drag the tabs and release at a new position
to manually reorder the buffers on the tab line.

*** New user option 'tab-line-tabs-buffer-group-function'.
It provides two choices to group tab buffers by major mode and by
project name.

*** Buffers on tab-line group tabs are now sorted alphabetically.
This will keep the fixed order of tabs, even after switching between
them.

** Help

*** New command 'help-find-source'.
Switch to a buffer visiting the source of what is being described in
"*Help*".  It is bound to 'C-h 4 s' globally.

*** New user option 'describe-bindings-outline-rules'.
This user option controls outline visibility in the output buffer of
'describe-bindings' when 'describe-bindings-outline' is non-nil.

*** 'describe-function' shows the function's inferred type when available.
For native compiled Lisp functions, 'describe-function' prints (after
the signature) the automatically inferred function type as well.  If the
function's type was explicitly declared (via the 'declare' form's
'ftype' property), 'describe-function' shows the declared type.  This is
controlled by the new user option 'help-display-function-type', which is
by default t; customize to nil to disable function type display.

*** 'describe-function' now shows the type of the function object.
The text used to say things like "car is a built-in function" whereas it
now says "car is a primitive-function" where "primitive-function" is the
name of the symbol returned by 'cl-type-of'.  You can click on those
words to get information about that type.

*** 'C-h m' ('describe-mode') uses outlining by default.
Set 'describe-mode-outline' to nil to get back the old behavior.

*** 'C-h k' ('describe-key') shows Unicode name.
For keybindings which produce single characters via translation or input
methods, 'C-h k' now shows the Unicode name of the produced character in
addition to the character itself, e.g.

'C-h k C-x 8 E' =>

    € 'EURO SIGN' (translated from C-x 8 E)

*** 'C-h b' ('describe-bindings') shows Unicode names.
For keybindings which produce single characters via translation (such as
those using the 'C-x 8' or 'A-' prefix, or 'dead-acute', 'dead-grave',
etc), the Unicode names will now be shown in addition to the character
itself, i.e.

    A-!			¡	INVERTED EXCLAMATION MARK
    A-$			¤	CURRENCY SIGN

and so on.

*** Multi-character key echo now ends with a suggestion to use Help.
Customize 'echo-keystrokes-help' to nil to prevent that.

** Customize

*** New command 'customize-dirlocals'.
This command pops up a buffer to edit the settings in ".dir-locals.el".

*** New command 'customize-toggle-option'.
This command can toggle boolean options for the duration of a session.

*** New prefix argument for modifying directory-local variables.
The commands 'add-dir-local-variable', 'delete-dir-local-variable' and
'copy-file-locals-to-dir-locals' now take an optional prefix argument,
to enter the file name where you want to modify directory-local
variables.

*** New user option 'safe-local-variable-directories'.
This user option names directories in which Emacs will treat all
directory-local variables as safe.

** CL Print

*** There is a new chapter in the CL manual documenting cl-print.el.
See the Info node "(cl) Printing".

*** You can expand the "..." truncation everywhere.
The code that allowed "..." to be expanded in the "*Backtrace*" buffer
should now work anywhere the data is generated by 'cl-print'.

*** The 'backtrace-ellipsis' button is replaced by 'cl-print-ellipsis'.

*** hash-tables' contents can be expanded via the ellipsis.

*** Modes can control the expansion via 'cl-print-expand-ellipsis-function'.

*** New setting 'raw' for 'cl-print-compiled'.
This setting causes byte-compiled functions to be printed in full by
'prin1'.  A button on this output can be activated to disassemble the
function.

** Miscellaneous

*** New command 'kill-matching-buffers-no-ask'.
This works like 'kill-matching-buffers', but without asking for
confirmation.

*** 'recover-file' can show diffs between auto save file and current file.
When answering the prompt with "diff" or "=", it now shows the diffs
between the auto save file and the current file.

*** 'read-passwd' can toggle the visibility of passwords.
Use 'TAB' in the minibuffer to show or hide the password.
Alternatively, click the new show-password icon on the mode-line with
'mouse-1' to toggle the visibility of the password.

*** 'advice-remove' is now an interactive command.
When called interactively, 'advice-remove' now prompts for an advised
function to the advice to remove.

*** New user option 'uniquify-dirname-transform'.
This can be used to customize how buffer names are uniquified, by
making arbitrary transforms on the buffer's directory name (whose
components are used to uniquify buffer names when they clash).  You
can use this to distinguish between buffers visiting files with the
same base name that belong to different projects by using the provided
transform function 'project-uniquify-dirname-transform'.

*** New user option 'remote-file-name-inhibit-delete-by-moving-to-trash'.
When non-nil, this option suppresses moving remote files to the local
trash when deleting.  Default is nil.

*** New user option 'remote-file-name-inhibit-auto-save'.
If this user option is non-nil, 'auto-save-mode' will not auto-save
remote buffers.  The default is nil.

*** New user option 'remote-file-name-access-timeout'.
If a positive number, this option limits the call of 'access-file'
for remote files to that number of seconds.  Default is nil.

*** New user option 'yes-or-no-prompt'.
This allows the user to customize the prompt that is appended by
'yes-or-no-p' when asking questions.  The default value is
"(yes or no) ".

*** New user option 'menu-bar-close-window'.
When non-nil, selecting "Close" from the "File" menu or clicking
"Close" in the tool bar will result in the current window being
deleted, if possible.  The default is nil, and these gestures kill the
buffer shown in the current window, but don't delete the window.

*** New face 'display-time-date-and-time'.
This is used for displaying the time and date components of
'display-time-mode'.

*** New face 'appt-notification' for 'appt-display-mode-line'.
It can be used to customize the look of the appointment notification
displayed on the mode line when 'appt-display-mode-line' is non-nil.

*** New icon images for general use.
Several symbolic icons have been added to "etc/images/symbols",
including plus, minus, check-mark, star, etc.

*** Emacs now recognizes shebang lines that pass '-S'/'--split-string' to 'env'.
When visiting a script that invokes 'env -S INTERPRETER ARGS...' in
its shebang line, Emacs will now skip over 'env -S' and deduce the
major mode based on the interpreter after 'env -S'.

*** 'insert-directory-program' is now a user option.
On *BSD and macOS systems, this user option now defaults to the "gls"
executable, if it exists.  This should remove the need to change its
value when installing GNU coreutils using something like ports or
Homebrew.

*** 'write-region-inhibit-fsync' now defaults to t in interactive mode.
This is the default in batch mode since Emacs 24.

*** Warnings are now by default displayed in a new window at frame's bottom.
Previously, when the selected frame had horizontally-split windows,
warnings were displayed in some window on the frame that was hard to
predict in advance.  The default behavior was changed to always display
the window showing the warnings at the bottom of the selected frame.
Customize the new user option 'warning-display-at-bottom' to the nil
value to get back the previous behavior.

*** The default value of 'read-process-output-max' was increased to 65536.

*** 'url-gateway-broken-resolution' is now obsolete.
This option was intended for use on SunOS 4.x and Ultrix systems,
neither of which have been supported by Emacs since version 23.1.
The user option 'url-gateway-nslookup-program' and the command
'url-gateway-nslookup-host' are consequently also obsolete.


* Editing Changes in Emacs 30.1

** New minor mode 'visual-wrap-prefix-mode'.
When enabled, continuation lines displayed for a wrapped long line
will receive a 'wrap-prefix' automatically computed from the line's
surrounding context, such that continuation lines are indented on
display as if they were filled with 'M-q' or similar.  Unlike 'M-q',
the indentation only happens on display, and doesn't change the buffer
text in any way.  The global minor mode
'global-visual-wrap-prefix-mode' enables this minor mode in all
buffers.

(This minor mode is the 'adaptive-wrap' ELPA package renamed and
lightly edited for inclusion in Emacs.)

** New global minor mode 'kill-ring-deindent-mode'.
When enabled, text being saved to the kill ring will be de-indented by
the column number at its start.  For example, saving the entire
function call within an indented block:

foo ()
{
  long_function_with_several_arguments (argument_1_compute (),
					argument_2_compute (),
					argument_3_compute ());
}

will save this to the kill ring:

long_function_with_several_arguments (argument_1_compute (),
				      argument_2_compute (),
				      argument_3_compute ())

This omits the two columns of extra indentation that would otherwise be
copied from the second and third lines and saved to the kill ring.

** New command 'replace-regexp-as-diff'.
It reads a regexp to search for and a string to replace with, then
displays a buffer with replacements as diffs.  After reviewing the
changes in the output buffer you can apply the replacements as
a patch to the current file buffer.  There are also new commands
'multi-file-replace-regexp-as-diff' that shows as diffs replacements
in a list of specified files, and 'dired-do-replace-regexp-as-diff'
that shows as diffs replacements in the marked files in Dired.

** New mode of prompting for register names and showing preview.
The new user option 'register-use-preview' can be customized to the
value t or 'insist' to request a different user interface of prompting for
register names and previewing the registers: Emacs will require
confirmation for overwriting the value of a register, and will show
the preview of registers without delay.  You can also customize this
new option to disable the preview completely.

The default value of 'register-use-preview' ('traditional') preserves the
behavior of Emacs 29 and before.  See the Info node "(emacs) Registers"
for more details about the new UI and its variants.

** New advanced macro counter commands.
New commands have been added to implement advanced macro counter
functions.

The commands 'C-x C-k C-r l' and 'C-x C-k C-r s' load and save the
macro counter from and to a number register, respectively.

The commands 'C-x C-k C-r a =', 'C-x C-k C-r a <', and 'C-x C-k C-r a >'
compare the macro counter with the contents of a number register and
increment the counter by an optional prefix if the comparison succeeds.

The commands 'C-x C-k C-q =', 'C-x C-k C-q <', and 'C-x C-k C-q >'
compare the macro counter with an optional prefix and terminate the
macro if the comparison succeeds.

** New mode 'kmacro-menu-mode' and new command 'list-keyboard-macros'.
The new command 'list-keyboard-macros' is the keyboard-macro version
of commands like 'list-buffers' and 'list-processes', creating a listing
of the currently existing keyboards macros using the new mode
'kmacro-menu-mode'.  It allows rearranging the macros in the ring,
duplicating them, deleting them, and editing their counters, formats,
and keys.

** On X, Emacs now supports input methods which perform "string conversion".
This means an input method can now ask Emacs to delete text
surrounding point and replace it with something else, as well as query
Emacs for surrounding text.  If your input method allows you to "undo"
mistaken compositions, this will now work as well.

** New user option 'duplicate-region-final-position'.
It controls the placement of point and the region after duplicating a
region with 'duplicate-dwim'.

** New user option 'mouse-prefer-closest-glyph'.
When enabled, clicking or dragging with the mouse will put the point
or start the drag in front of the buffer position corresponding to the
glyph with the closest X coordinate to the click or start of the drag.
In other words, if the mouse pointer is in the right half of a glyph,
point will be put after the buffer position corresponding to that glyph,
whereas if the mouse pointer is in the left half of a glyph, point
will be put in front the buffer position corresponding to that glyph.
By default this is disabled.

** New pre-defined values for 'electric-quote-chars'.
The available customization options for 'electric-quote-chars' have been
updated with common pairs of quotation characters, including "‘", "’",
"“", "”", "«", "»", "‹", "›", "‚", "„", "「", "」", "『", and "』".
The default is unchanged.

** 'M-TAB' now invokes 'completion-at-point' in Text mode.
By default, Text mode no longer binds 'M-TAB' to 'ispell-complete-word'.
Instead, this mode arranges for 'completion-at-point', globally bound to
'M-TAB', to perform word completion as well.  You can have Text mode
binding 'M-TAB' to 'ispell-complete-word' as it did in previous Emacs
versions, or disable Ispell word completion in Text mode altogether, by
customizing the new user option 'text-mode-ispell-word-completion'.

** Internationalization

*** Mode-line mnemonics for some coding-systems have changed.
The mode-line mnemonic for 'utf-7' is now the lowercase 'u', to be
consistent with the other encodings of this family.

The mode-line mnemonic for 'koi8-u' is now 'У', U+0423 CYRILLIC
CAPITAL LETTER U, to distinguish between this encoding and the
UTF-8/UTF-16 family.

If your terminal cannot display 'У', or if you want to get the old
behavior back for any other reason, you can do that using the
'coding-system-put' function.  For example, the following restores the
previous behavior of showing 'U' in the mode line for 'koi8-u':

    (coding-system-put 'koi8-u :mnemonic ?U)

*** 'vietnamese-tcvn' is now a coding system alias for 'vietnamese-vscii'.
VSCII-1 and TCVN-5712 are different names for the same character
encoding.  Therefore, the duplicate coding system definition has been
dropped in favor of an alias.

The mode-line mnemonic for 'vietnamese-vscii' and its aliases is the
lowercase letter "v".

*** Users in CJK locales can control width of some non-CJK characters.
Some characters are considered by Unicode as "ambiguous" with respect
to their display width: either "full-width" (i.e., taking 2 columns on
display) or "narrow" (taking 1 column).  The actual width depends on
the fonts used for these characters by Emacs or (for text-mode frames)
by the terminal emulator.  Traditionally, font sets in CJK locales
were set up so as to display these characters as full-width, and thus
Emacs modified the char-width table in those locales to follow suit.
Lately, the tendency is to display these characters as narrow.  The
new user option 'cjk-ambiguous-chars-are-wide' allows users to control
whether Emacs considers these characters as full-width (the default)
or narrow (if the variable is customized to the nil value).

This setting affects the results of 'string-width' and similar
functions in CJK locales.

*** New input methods for the Urdu, Pashto, and Sindhi languages.
These languages are spoken in Pakistan and Afghanistan.

*** New input method "english-colemak".
This input method supports the Colemak keyboard layout.

*** Additional 'C-x 8' key translations for "æ" and "Æ".
These characters can now be input with 'C-x 8 a e' and 'C-x 8 A E',
respectively, in addition to the existing translations 'C-x 8 / e' and
'C-x 8 / E'.

*** New 'C-x 8' key translations for "low" quotes "„", and "‚".
These can now be entered with 'C-x , "' and 'C-x , ''.

*** New German language 'C-x 8' key translations for quotation marks.
The characters "„", "“", and "”" can now be entered with 'C-x 8 v',
'C-x 8 b' and 'C-x 8 n'.  The single versions "‚", "‘", and "’" can now
be entered with 'C-x 8 V', 'C-x 8 B' and 'C-x 8 N'.  These characters
are used for the official German quoting style.  Using them requires
activating German language support via 'iso-transl-set-language'.

*** "latin-prefix" and "latin-postfix" quotation marks additions.
These input methods can now produce single, double and "low" left and
right quotation marks:

    "‘", "’", "“", "”", "„", and "‚"

by using "[", "]", and "," for "left", "right", and "low" respectively
to modify "'" and """.

*** "latin-prefix" and "latin-postfix" guillemets support.
These input methods can now produce single guillemets "‹" and "›".  For
"latin-prefix" use "~~<" and "~~>", for "latin-postfix" use "<~" and
">~".  Double guillemets ("«" and "»") were already supported.

*** New French language 'C-x 8' key translations for "‹" and "›".
These characters can now be entered using 'C-x 8 ~ <' and 'C-x 8 ~ >',
respectively, after activating French language support via
'iso-transl-set-language'.  Double guillemets were already supported via
'C-x 8 <' and 'C-x 8 >'

*** Additional 'C-x 8' key translation for Euro "€" currency symbol.
This can now be entered using 'C-x 8 E' in addition to the existing
'C-x 8 * E' translation.


* Changes in Specialized Modes and Packages in Emacs 30.1

** Outline mode

*** New commands to show/hide outlines by regexp.
'C-c / h' ('outline-hide-by-heading-regexp') asks for a regexp and then
hides the body lines of all outlines whose heading lines match the
regexp.  'C-c / s' ('outline-show-by-heading-regexp') does the inverse:
it shows the bodies of outlines that matched a regexp.

*** 'outline-minor-mode' is supported in tree-sitter major modes.
It can be used in all tree-sitter major modes that set either the
variable 'treesit-simple-imenu-settings' or 'treesit-outline-predicate'.

** Info

*** New user option 'Info-url-alist'.
This user option associates manual names with URLs.  It affects the
'Info-goto-node-web' command.  By default, associations for all
Emacs-included manuals are set.  Further associations can be added for
arbitrary Info manuals.

*** Emacs can now display Info manuals compressed with 'lzip'.
This requires the 'lzip' program to be installed on your system.

** GUD (Grand Unified Debugger)

*** New user option 'gud-highlight-current-line'.
When enabled, GUD will visually emphasize the line being executed upon
pauses in the debuggee's execution, such as those occasioned by
breakpoints being hit.

*** New command 'lldb'.
Run the LLDB debugger, analogous to the 'gud-gdb' command.

*** Variable order and truncation can now be configured in 'gdb-many-windows'.
The new user option 'gdb-locals-table-row-config' allows users to
configure the order and max length of various properties in the local
variables buffer when using 'gdb-many-windows'.

By default, this user option is set to write the properties in the order:
'name', 'type' and 'value', where the 'name' and 'type' are truncated to 20
characters, and the 'value' is truncated according to the value of
'gdb-locals-value-limit'.

If you want to get back the old behavior, set the user option to the value

    (setopt gdb-locals-table-row-config
            `((type . 0) (name . 0) (value . ,gdb-locals-value-limit)))

*** New user option 'gdb-display-io-buffer'.
If this is nil, command 'gdb' will neither create nor display a separate
buffer for the I/O of the program being debugged, but will instead
redirect the program's interaction to the GDB execution buffer.  The
default is t, to preserve previous behavior.

** Grep

*** New user option 'grep-use-headings'.
When non-nil, the output of Grep is split into sections, one for each
file, instead of having file names prefixed to each line.  It is
equivalent to the '--heading' option of some tools such as 'git grep'
and 'rg'.  The headings are displayed using the new 'grep-heading' face.
The default is nil.

** Compilation mode

*** The 'omake' matching rule is now disabled by default.
This is because it partly acts by modifying other rules which may
occasionally be surprising.  It can be re-enabled by adding 'omake' to
'compilation-error-regexp-alist'.

*** Lua errors and stack traces are now recognized.
Compilation mode now recognizes Lua language errors and stack traces.
Every Lua error is recognized as a compilation error, and every Lua
stack frame is recognized as a compilation info.

** Project

*** New user option 'project-mode-line'.
When non-nil, display the name of the current project on the mode
line.  Clicking 'mouse-1' on the project name pops up the project
menu.  The default value is nil.

*** New user option 'project-file-history-behavior'.
Customizing it to 'relativize' makes commands like 'project-find-file'
and 'project-find-dir' display previous history entries relative to
the current project.

*** New user option 'project-key-prompt-style'.
The look of the key prompt in the project switcher has been changed
slightly.  To get the previous one, set this option to 'brackets'.

*** Function 'project-try-vc' tries harder to find the responsible VCS.
When 'project-vc-extra-root-markers' is non-nil, and causes a
subdirectory project to be detected which is not a VCS root, Project now
additionally traverses the parent directories until a VCS root is found
(if any), so that the ignore rules for that repository are used, and
the file listing's performance is still optimized.

*** New commands 'project-any-command' and 'project-prefix-or-any-command'.
The former is now bound to 'C-x p o' by default.
The latter is designed primarily for use as a value of
'project-switch-commands'.  If instead of a short menu you prefer to
have access to all keys defined inside 'project-prefix-map', as well
as global bindings (to run other commands inside the project root),
you can add this to your init script:

    (setopt project-switch-commands #'project-prefix-or-any-command)

*** New variable 'project-files-relative-names'.
If it is non-nil, 'project-files' can return file names relative to the
project root.  Project backends can use this to improve the performance
of their 'project-files' implementation.

** VC

*** Log-Edit buffers now display a tool bar.
This tool bar contains items for committing log entries and editing or
generating log entries, among other editing operations.

*** New user option 'vc-git-shortlog-switches'.
This is a string or a list of strings that specifies the Git log
switches for shortlogs, such as the one produced by 'C-x v L'.
'vc-git-log-switches' is no longer used for shortlogs.

*** New value 'no-backend' for user option 'vc-display-status'.
With this value only the revision number is displayed on the mode-line.

*** Obsolete command 'vc-switch-backend' re-added as 'vc-change-backend'.
The command was previously obsoleted and unbound in Emacs 28.

*** Support for viewing VC change history across renames.
When a fileset's VC change history ends at a rename, 'C-x v l' now
prints the old name(s) and shows a button which jumps to the history of
the files under the old names.  This feature is supported for Git and
Hg.  Naturally, 'vc-git-print-log-follow' should be nil for this to work
(or '--follow' should not be in 'vc-hg-log-switches', in Hg's case).
Unlike when the '--follow' switch is used, commands to see the diff of
the old revision ('d'), to check out an old file version ('f') or to
annotate it ('a'), also work on revisions which precede renames.

*** 'vc-annotate' now abbreviates the Git revision in the buffer name.
When using the Git backend, 'vc-annotate' will use an abbreviated
revision identifier in its buffer name.  To restore the previous
behavior, set user option 'vc-annotate-use-short-revision' to nil.

*** New user option 'vc-git-file-name-changes-switches'.
It allows tweaking the thresholds for rename and copy detection.

*** VC Directory buffers now display the upstream branch in Git repositories.
The "upstream branch" is the branch from which 'vc-pull' fetches changes
by default.  In Git terms, the upstream branch of branch B is determined
by configuration variables 'branch.B.remote' and 'branch.B.merge'.

When these configuration variables are set for the current branch, the
VC Directory buffer will show the corresponding upstream branch under
the "Tracking" header.

** Diff mode

*** New user option 'diff-refine-nonmodified'.
When this is non-nil, 'diff-refine-hunk' will highlight lines that were
added or removed in their entirety (as opposed to modified lines, where
some parts of the line were modified), using the same faces as for
highlighting the words added and removed within modified lines.  The
default value is nil.

*** 'diff-ignore-whitespace-hunk' can now be applied to all hunks.
When called with a non-nil prefix argument,
'diff-ignore-whitespace-hunk' now iterates over all the hunks in the
current diff, regenerating them without whitespace changes.

*** New user option 'diff-ignore-whitespace-switches'.
This allows changing which type of whitespace changes are ignored when
regenerating hunks with 'diff-ignore-whitespace-hunk'.  Defaults to
the previously hard-coded "-b".

*** New command 'diff-apply-buffer' bound to 'C-c RET a'.
It applies the diff in the entire diff buffer and
saves all modified file buffers.

** Dired

*** New user option 'dired-movement-style'.
When non-nil, make 'dired-next-line', 'dired-previous-line',
'dired-next-dirline', 'dired-prev-dirline' skip empty lines.
It also controls how to move point when encountering a boundary
(e.g., if every line is visible, invoking 'dired-next-line' at
the last line will move to the first line).  The default is nil.

*** New user option 'dired-filename-display-length'.
It is an integer representing the maximum display length of file names.
The middle part of a file name whose length exceeds the restriction is
hidden and an ellipsis is displayed instead.  A value of 'window'
means using the right edge of window as the display restriction.  The
default is nil.

*** New user option 'shell-command-guess-functions'.
It defines how to populate a list of commands available
for 'M-!', 'M-&', '!', '&' and the context menu "Open With"
based on marked files in Dired.  Possible backends are
'dired-guess-default', MIME types, XDG configuration
and a universal command such as "open" or "start"
that delegates to the OS.

*** New command 'dired-do-open'.
This command is bound to 'E' (mnemonics "External").  Also it can be
used by clicking "Open" in the context menu; it "opens" the marked or
clicked on files according to the OS conventions.  For example, on
systems supporting XDG, this runs 'xdg-open' on the files.

*** New variable 'dired-guess-shell-alist-optional'.
It contains commands for external viewers and players for various media
formats, moved to this list from 'dired-guess-shell-alist-default'.

*** The default value of 'dired-omit-size-limit' was increased.
After performance improvements to omitting in large directories, the new
default value is 300k, up from 100k.  This means 'dired-omit-mode' will
omit files in directories whose directory listing is up to 300 kilobytes
in size.

*** 'dired-listing-switches' handles connection-local values if exist.
This allows you to customize different switches for different remote machines.

** Ediff

*** New user option 'ediff-floating-control-frame'.
If non-nil, try making the control frame be floating rather than tiled.

Many X tiling window managers make the Ediff control frame a tiled
window equal in size to the main Emacs frame, which works poorly.
This option is useful to set if you use such a window manager.

** Buffer Selection

*** New user option 'bs-default-action-list'.
You can now configure how to display the "*buffer-selection*" buffer
using this new option.  (Or set 'display-buffer-alist' directly.)

** Eshell

*** You can now run Eshell scripts in batch mode.
By adding the following interpreter directive to an Eshell script, you
can make it executable like other shell scripts:

    #!/usr/bin/env -S emacs --batch -f eshell-batch-file

*** New builtin Eshell command 'compile'.
This command runs another command, sending its output to a compilation
buffer when the command would output interactively.  This can be useful
when defining aliases so that they produce a compilation buffer when
appropriate, but still allow piping the output elsewhere if desired.
For more information, see the "(eshell) Built-ins" node in the Eshell
manual.

*** Eshell's 'env' command now supports running commands.
Like in many other shells, Eshell's 'env' command now lets you run a
command passed as arguments to 'env'.  If you pass any initial
arguments of the form 'VAR=VALUE', 'env' will first set 'VAR' to
'VALUE' before running the command.

*** Eshell's 'umask' command now supports setting the mask symbolically.
Now, you can pass an argument like "u+w,o-r" to Eshell's 'umask'
command, which will give write permission for owners of newly-created
files and deny read permission for users who are not members of the
file's group.  See the Info node "(coreutils) File permissions" for
more information on this notation.

*** Performance improvements for interactive output in Eshell.
Interactive output in Eshell should now be significantly faster,
especially for commands that can print large amounts of output
(e.g. "cat").  For external commands, Eshell saves time by only looking
for password prompts in the last 256 characters of each block of output.
To restore the previous behavior when checking for password prompts, set
'eshell-password-prompt-max-length' to 'most-positive-fixnum'.

*** Eshell built-in commands can now display progress.
Eshell built-in commands like "cat" and "ls" now update the display
periodically while running to show their progress.

*** New special reference type '#<marker POSITION BUFFER>'.
This special reference type returns a marker at 'POSITION' in
'BUFFER'.  You can insert it by typing or using the new interactive
command 'eshell-insert-marker'.  You can also insert special
references of any type using the new interactive command
'eshell-insert-special-reference'.  See the "(eshell) Arguments" node
in the Eshell manual for more details.

*** New splice operator for Eshell dollar expansions.
Dollar expansions in Eshell now let you splice the elements of the
expansion in-place using '$@expr'.  This makes it easier to fill lists
of arguments into a command, such as when defining aliases.  For more
information, see the "(eshell) Dollars Expansion" node in the Eshell
manual.

*** You can now splice Eshell globs in-place into argument lists.
By setting 'eshell-glob-splice-results' to a non-nil value, Eshell
will expand glob results in-place as if you had typed each matching
file name individually.  For more information, see the "(eshell)
Globbing" node in the Eshell manual.

*** Eshell now supports negative numbers and ranges for indices.
Now, you can retrieve the last element of a list with '$my-list[-1]'
or get a sublist of elements 2 through 4 with '$my-list[2..5]'.  For
more information, see the "(eshell) Dollars Expansion" node in the
Eshell manual.

*** Eshell commands can now be explicitly-remote (or local).
By prefixing a command name in Eshell with a remote identifier, like
"/ssh:user@remote:whoami", you can now run commands on a particular
host no matter your current directory.  Likewise, you can run a
command on your local system no matter your current directory via
"/local:whoami".  For more information, see the "(eshell) Remote Access"
node in the Eshell manual.

*** Eshell's '$UID' and '$GID' variables are now connection-aware.
Now, when expanding '$UID' or '$GID' in a remote directory, the value
is the user or group ID associated with the remote connection.

*** Eshell now uses 'field' properties in its output.
In particular, this means that pressing the '<home>' key moves the
point to the beginning of your input, not the beginning of the whole
line.  If you want to go back to the old behavior, add something like
this to your configuration:

    (keymap-set eshell-mode-map "<home>" #'eshell-bol-ignoring-prompt)

This also means you no longer need to adjust 'eshell-prompt-regexp'
when customizing your Eshell prompt.

*** You can now properly unload Eshell.
Calling '(unload-feature 'eshell)' no longer signals an error, and now
correctly unloads Eshell and all of its modules.

*** 'eshell-read-aliases-list' is now an interactive command.
After manually editing 'eshell-aliases-file', you can use this command
to load the edited aliases.

*** 'rgrep' is now a builtin Eshell command.
Running 'rgrep' in Eshell now uses the Emacs grep facility instead of
calling external rgrep.

*** If a command exits abnormally, the Eshell prompt now shows its exit code.

*** New user option 'eshell-history-append'.
If non-nil, each Eshell session will save history by appending new
entries of that session to the history file rather than overwriting
the file with the whole history of the session.  The default is nil.

** Pcomplete

*** New user option 'pcomplete-remote-file-ignore'.
When this option is non-nil, remote file names are not completed by
Pcomplete.  Packages, like 'shell-mode', could set this in order to
suppress remote file name completion at all.

*** Completion for the 'doas' command has been added.
Command completion for 'doas' in Eshell and Shell mode will now work.

** Shell mode

*** New user option 'shell-get-old-input-include-continuation-lines'.
When this user option is non-nil, 'shell-get-old-input' ('C-RET')
includes multiple shell "\" continuation lines from command output.
Default is nil.

*** New user option 'shell-history-file-name'.
When this user option is set to t, 'shell-mode' does not read the shell
history file.  Setting this user option to a string specifies the name
of the shell history file to be read.  A nil value triggers reading the
environment variable 'HISTFILE'.

In a 'shell' buffer, this user option is connection-local.

*** Performance improvements for interactive output.
Interactive output in Shell mode now scans more selectively for password
prompts by only examining the last 256 characters of each block of
output, reducing the time spent when printing large amounts of output.
To restore the old behavior, set 'comint-password-prompt-max-length' to
'most-positive-fixnum'.

** Prog mode

*** New command 'prog-fill-reindent-defun'.
This command either fills a single paragraph in a defun, such as a
docstring, or a comment, or (re)indents the surrounding defun if point
is not in a comment or a string.  By default, it is bound to 'M-q' in
'prog-mode' and all its descendants.

** Imenu

*** New user option 'imenu-flatten'.
It controls whether to flatten the list of sections in an imenu, and
how to display the sections in the flattened list.

*** The sort order of Imenu completions can now be customized.
You can customize the user option 'completion-category-overrides'
and set 'display-sort-function' for the category 'imenu'.

** Which Function mode

*** Which Function mode can now display function names on the header line.
The new user option 'which-func-display' allows choosing where the
function name is displayed.  The default is 'mode' to display in the
mode line.  'header' will display in the header line;
'mode-and-header' displays in both the header line and mode line.

*** New user option 'which-func-update-delay'.
This replaces the user option 'idle-update-delay', which was previously
used to control the delay before 'which-function-mode' updated its
display.  The user option 'idle-update-delay', which was only used by
Which Function mode, is now obsolete.

** Tramp

*** Tramp methods can be optional.
An optional connection method is not enabled by default.  The user must
enable it explicitly by the 'tramp-enable-method' command.  The existing
methods "fcp", "krlogin", " ksu" and "nc" are optional now.

*** New optional connection method "androidsu".
This provides access to system files with elevated privileges granted by
the idiosyncratic 'su' implementations and system utilities customary on
Android.

*** New optional connection method "run0".
This connection method is similar to "sudo", but it uses the 'systemd'
framework internally.

*** New connection methods "dockercp" and "podmancp".
These are the external methods counterparts of "docker" and "podman".

*** New optional connection methods for containers.
There are new optional connection methods "toolbox", "distrobox",
"flatpak", "apptainer" and "nspawn".  They allow accessing system
containers provided by Toolbox or Distrobox, sandboxes provided by
Flatpak, instances managed by Apptainer, or accessing systemd-based
light-weight containers..

*** Connection method "kubernetes" supports now optional container name.
The host name for Kubernetes connections can be of kind [CONTAINER.]POD,
in order to specify a dedicated container.  If there is just the pod
name, the first container in the pod is taken.  The new user options
'tramp-kubernetes-context' and 'tramp-kubernetes-namespace' allow
accessing pods with different context or namespace but the default one.

*** Rename 'tramp-use-ssh-controlmaster-options' to 'tramp-use-connection-share'.
The old name still exists as obsolete variable alias.  This user
option controls now connection sharing for both ssh-based and
plink-based methods.  It allows the values t, nil, and 'suppress'.
The latter suppresses also "ControlMaster" settings in the user's
"~/.ssh/config" file, or connection share configuration in PuTTY
sessions, respectively.

*** New command 'tramp-cleanup-some-buffers'.
It kills only a subset of opened remote buffers, subject to the user
option 'tramp-cleanup-some-buffers-hook'.

*** New command 'inhibit-remote-files'.
This command disables the handling of file names with the special
remote file name syntax.  It should be applied only when remote files
won't be used in this Emacs instance.  It provides a slightly improved
performance of file name handling in Emacs.

*** New macro 'without-remote-files'.
This macro could wrap code which handles local files only.  Due to the
temporary deactivation of remote files, it results in a slightly
improved performance of file name handling in Emacs.

*** New user option 'tramp-completion-multi-hop-methods'.
It contains a list of connection methods for which completion should
be attempted at the end of a multi-hop chain.  This allows completion
candidates to include a list of, for example, containers running on a
remote docker host.

*** New command 'tramp-revert-buffer-with-sudo'.
It reverts the current buffer to visit with "sudo" permissions.  The
buffer must either visit a file, or it must run 'dired-mode'.  Another
method but "sudo" can be configured with user option
'tramp-file-name-with-method'.

*** Direct asynchronous processes are indicated by a connection-local variable.
If direct asynchronous processes shall be used, set the connection-local
variable 'tramp-direct-async-process' to a non-nil value.  In previous
Emacs versions this was indicated by the connection property
"direct-async-process".  That connection property (though not connection
properties and 'tramp-connection-properties' in general) is now
deprecated.  See the Tramp manual "(tramp) Improving performance of
asynchronous remote processes".

*** Direct asynchronous processes use 'tramp-remote-path'.
When a direct asynchronous process is invoked, it uses 'tramp-remote-path'
for setting the remote 'PATH' environment variable.

** SHR

*** New user option 'shr-fill-text'.
When 'shr-fill-text' is non-nil (the default), SHR will fill text
according to the width of the window.  If you customize it to nil, SHR
will leave the text as-is; in that case, EWW will automatically enable
'visual-line-mode' when displaying a page so that long lines are
visually wrapped at word boundaries.

** EWW

*** New mouse bindings in EWW buffers.
Certain form elements that were displayed as buttons, yet could only be
activated by keyboard input, are now operable using 'mouse-2'.  With
"Submit" buttons, this triggers submission of the form, while clicks on
other classes of buttons either toggle their values or prompt for user
input, as the case may be.

*** EWW text input fields and areas are now fields.
In consequence, movement commands and OS input method features now
recognize and confine their activities to the text input field around
point.  See also the Info node "(elisp) Fields".

*** 'eww-open-file' can now display the file in a new buffer.
By default, the command reuses the "*eww*" buffer, but if called with
the new argument NEW-BUFFER non-nil, it will use a new buffer instead.
Interactively, invoke 'eww-open-file' with a prefix argument to
activate this behavior.

*** 'eww' URL or keyword prompt now has tab completion.
The interactive minibuffer prompt when invoking 'eww' now has support
for tab completion.

*** 'eww' URL and keyword prompt now completes suggested URIs and bookmarks.
The interactive minibuffer prompt when invoking 'eww' now provides
completions from 'eww-suggest-uris'.  'eww-suggest-uris' now includes
bookmark URIs.

*** New command 'eww-copy-alternate-url'.
It copies an alternate link on the page currently visited in EWW into
the kill ring.  Alternate links are optional metadata that HTML pages
use for linking to their alternative representations, such as translated
versions or associated RSS feeds.  It is bound to 'A' by default.

*** 'eww-open-in-new-buffer' supports the prefix argument.
When invoked with the prefix argument ('C-u'),
'eww-open-in-new-buffer' will not make the new buffer the current one.
This is useful for continuing reading the URL in the current buffer
when the new URL is fetched.

*** History navigation in EWW now behaves as in other browsers.
Previously, when navigating back and forward through page history, EWW
would add a duplicate entry to the end of the history list each time.
This made it impossible to navigate to the "end" of the history list.
Now, navigating through history in EWW simply changes your position in
the history list, allowing you to reach the end as expected.  In
addition, when browsing to a new page from a "historical" one (i.e., a
page loaded by navigating back through history), EWW deletes the history
entries newer than the current page.  To change the behavior when
browsing from "historical" pages, you can customize
'eww-before-browse-history-function'.

*** 'eww-readable' now toggles display of the readable parts of a web page.
When called interactively, 'eww-readable' toggles whether to display
only the readable parts of a page or the full page.  With a positive
prefix argument, it always displays the readable parts, and with a zero
or negative prefix, it always displays the full page.

*** New user option 'eww-readable-urls'.
This is a list of regular expressions matching the URLs where EWW should
display only the readable parts by default.  For more details, see
"(eww) Basics" in the EWW manual.

*** New user option 'eww-readable-adds-to-history'.
When non-nil (the default), calling 'eww-readable' adds a new entry to
the EWW page history.

** Go-ts mode

*** New command 'go-ts-mode-docstring'.
This command adds a docstring comment to the current defun.  If a
comment already exists, point is only moved to the comment.  It is
bound to 'C-c C-d' in 'go-ts-mode'.

** Man mode

*** New user option 'Man-prefer-synchronous-call'.
When this is non-nil, run the 'man' command synchronously rather than
asynchronously (which is the default behavior).

*** New user option 'Man-support-remote-systems'.
This option controls whether the man page is formatted on the remote
system when the current buffer's default-directory is remote.  You can
invoke the 'man' command with a prefix argument to countermand the
value of this option for the current invocation of 'man'.

** DocView

*** New user option 'doc-view-mpdf-use-svg'.
If non-nil, DocView uses SVG images to display PDF documents.  The
default is non-nil if your system supports display of SVG images.

*** New face 'doc-view-svg-face'.
This replaces 'doc-view-svg-foreground' and 'doc-view-svg-background'.
By default, this face has black foreground on white background and
inherits from the default face.  When unsetting the foreground and
background values, the display in DocView is styled according to the
current theme.  However, this, or any non-standard values, can result in
poor contrast for documents which aren't simply black text on white
background.

*** DocView buffers now display a new tool bar.
This tool bar contains options for searching and navigating within the
document, replacing the incompatible items for incremental search and
editing within the default tool bar displayed in the past.

** Shortdoc

*** New function 'shortdoc-function-examples'.
This function returns examples of use of a given Emacs Lisp function
from the available shortdoc information.

*** New function 'shortdoc-help-fns-examples-function'.
This function inserts into the current buffer examples of use of a
given Emacs Lisp function, which it gleans from the shortdoc
information.  If you want 'describe-function' ('C-h f') to insert
examples of using the function into regular "*Help*" buffers, add the
following to your init file:

    (add-hook 'help-fns-describe-function-functions
              #'shortdoc-help-fns-examples-function)

** Package

*** New user option 'package-vc-register-as-project'.
When non-nil, 'package-vc-install' and 'package-vc-checkout' will
automatically register every package they install as a project, that you
can quickly select using 'project-switch-project' ('C-x p p').  Default
is t.

*** New user option 'package-vc-allow-build-commands'.
Controls for which packages Emacs runs extra build commands when
installing directly from the package VCS repository.

*** New command 'package-vc-log-incoming'.
This commands displays incoming changes for a VC package without
modifying the current checkout.

*** New command to start an inferior Emacs loading only specific packages.
The new command 'package-isolate' will start a new Emacs process, as
a sub-process of Emacs where you invoke the command, in a way that
causes the new process to load only some of the installed packages.
The command prompts for the packages to activate in this
sub-process, and is intended for testing Emacs and/or the packages
in a clean environment.

** Flymake

*** New user option 'flymake-indicator-type'.
This controls which error indicator type Flymake should use in the
current buffer.  Depending on your preference, this can either use
fringes or margins for indicating errors, the default is 'margins'.

*** New user option 'flymake-margin-indicators-string'.
It controls, for each error type, the string and its face to display as
the margin indicator.

*** New user option 'flymake-autoresize-margins'.
If non-nil (the default), Flymake will resize the margins when
'flymake-mode' is turned on or off.
Only relevant if 'flymake-indicator-type' is set to 'margins'.

*** New user option 'flymake-margin-indicator-position'.
It controls whether to use margins for margin indicators, and which
margin (left or right) to use.  Default is to use the left margin.

*** New user option 'flymake-show-diagnostics-at-end-of-line'.
When non-nil, Flymake shows summarized descriptions of diagnostics at
the end of the line.  Depending on your preference, this can either be
distracting and easily confused with actual code, or a significant
early aid that relieves you from moving the buffer or reaching for the
mouse to consult an error message.  Default is nil.

** Flyspell

*** New user option 'flyspell-check-changes'.
When non-nil, Flyspell mode spell-checks only words that you edited; it
does not check unedited words just because you move point across them.
Default is nil.

** JS mode.
The binding 'M-.' has been removed from the major mode keymaps in
'js-mode' and 'js-ts-mode', having it default to the global binding
which calls 'xref-find-definitions'.  If the previous one worked
better for you, use 'define-key' in your init script to bind
'js-find-symbol' to that combination again.

** Json mode.
'js-json-mode' does not derive from 'js-mode' any more so as not
to confuse tools like Eglot or YASnippet into thinking that those
buffers contain Javascript code.

** Python mode

*** New user option 'python-indent-block-paren-deeper'.
If non-nil, increase the indentation of the lines inside parens in a
header of a block when they are indented to the same level as the body
of the block, producing:

    if (some_expression
            and another_expression):
        do_something()

instead of:

    if (some_expression
        and another_expression):
        do_something()

Default is nil.

*** New user option 'python-interpreter-args'.
This allows the user to specify command line arguments to the non
interactive Python interpreter specified by 'python-interpreter'.

*** New function 'python-shell-send-block'.
It sends the python block delimited by 'python-nav-beginning-of-block'
and 'python-nav-end-of-block' to the inferior Python process.

** Inferior Python mode

*** Default value of 'python-shell-compilation-regexp-alist' is changed.
Support for Python's ExceptionGroup has been added, so in the Python
shell, the line indicating the source of an error in the error messages
from ExceptionGroup will be recognized as well.

** Eldoc

*** 'eldoc' no longer truncates to a single line by default.
Previously, the entire docstring was not available to eldoc, which made
'eldoc-echo-area-use-multiline-p' ineffective.  The old behavior may be
kept by customizing 'eldoc-echo-area-use-multiline-p'.

** Scheme mode.
Scheme mode now handles the regular expression literal '#/regexp/' that
is available in some Scheme implementations.
Also, it should now handle nested sexp-comments.

** Use package

*** New ':vc' keyword.
This keyword enables the user to install packages using package-vc.el.

*** New user option 'use-package-vc-prefer-newest'.
If non-nil, always install the newest commit of a package when using the
':vc' keyword rather than its stable release.  Default is nil.

** Gnus

*** New backend 'nnfeed'.
This allows backend developers to easily create new backends for web
feeds, as inheriting backends of 'nnfeed'.

*** New backend 'nnatom'.
This allow users to add Atom Syndication Format feeds to Gnus as
servers.

*** The 'nnweb-type' option 'gmane' has been removed.
The gmane.org website is, sadly, down since a number of years with no
prospect of it coming back.  Therefore, it is no longer valid to set
the server variable 'nnweb-type' to 'gmane'.

*** New user option 'gnus-mode-line-logo'.
This allows the user to either disable the display of any logo or
specify which logo will be displayed as part of the
buffer-identification in the mode-line of Gnus buffers.

*** 'gnus-summary-limit-to-age' now counts days since midnight.
"Less than 1 day" now means "since last midnight", rather than "less
than 24 hours old".

** Rmail

*** New commands for reading mailing lists.
The new Rmail commands 'rmail-mailing-list-post',
'rmail-mailing-list-unsubscribe', 'rmail-mailing-list-help', and
'rmail-mailing-list-archive' allow, respectively, posting to,
unsubscribing from, requesting help about, and browsing the archives
of, the mailing list from which the current email message was
delivered.

** Dictionary

*** New user option 'dictionary-search-interface'.
Controls how the 'dictionary-search' command prompts for and displays
dictionary definitions.  Customize this user option to 'help' to have
'dictionary-search' display definitions in a "*Help*" buffer and
provide dictionary-based minibuffer completion for word selection.
Default is nil, which means to use a "*Dictionary*" buffer.

*** New user option 'dictionary-read-word-prompt'.
This allows the user to customize the prompt that is used by
'dictionary-search' when asking for a word to search in the
dictionaries.

*** New user option 'dictionary-display-definition-function'.
This allows the user to customize the way in which 'dictionary-search'
displays word definitions.  If non-nil, this user option should be set
to a function that displays a word definition obtained from a
dictionary server.  The new function
'dictionary-display-definition-in-help-buffer' can be used to display
the definition in a "*Help*" buffer, instead of the default
"*Dictionary*" buffer.

*** New user option 'dictionary-read-word-function'.
This allows the user to customize the way in which 'dictionary-search'
prompts for a word to search in the dictionary.  This user option
should be set to a function that lets the user select a word and
returns it as a string.  The new function
'dictionary-completing-read-word' can be used to prompt with
completion based on dictionary matches.

*** New user option 'dictionary-read-dictionary-function'.
This allows the user to customize the way in which 'dictionary-search'
prompts for a dictionary to search in.  This user option should be set
to a function that lets the user select a dictionary and returns its
name as a string.  The new function
'dictionary-completing-read-dictionary' can be used to prompt with
completion based on dictionaries that the server supports.

*** The default value of 'dictionary-tooltip-dictionary' has changed.
The new default value is t, which means use the same dictionary as the
value of 'dictionary-default-dictionary'.  The previous default value
was nil, which effectively disabled 'dictionary-tooltip-mode', even if
the mode was turned on.

** Pp

*** New 'pp-default-function' user option replaces 'pp-use-max-width'.
Its default value is 'pp-fill', a new default pretty-printing function,
which tries to obey 'fill-column'.

*** 'pp-to-string' takes an additional PP-FUNCTION argument.
This argument specifies the prettifying algorithm to use.

*** 'pp' and 'pp-to-string' now always include a terminating newline.
In the past they included a terminating newline in most cases but not all.

** Emacs Lisp mode

*** 'elisp-flymake-byte-compile' is disabled for untrusted files.
For security reasons, this backend can be used only in those files
specified as trusted according to 'trusted-content' and emits an
"untrusted content" warning otherwise.
This fixes CVE-2024-53920.

*** ',@' now has 'prefix' syntax.
Previously, the '@' character, which normally has 'symbol' syntax,
would combine with a following Lisp symbol and interfere with symbol
searching.

*** 'emacs-lisp-docstring-fill-column' now defaults to 72.
It was previously 65.  The new default formats documentation strings to
fit on fewer lines without negatively impacting readability.

** CPerl mode

*** Subroutine signatures are now supported.
CPerl mode fontifies subroutine signatures like variable declarations
which makes them visually distinct from subroutine prototypes.

*** Syntax of Perl up to version 5.40 is supported.
CPerl mode supports the new keywords for exception handling and the
object oriented syntax which were added in Perl 5.36, 5.38 and 5.40.

*** New user option 'cperl-fontify-trailer'.
This user option takes the values 'perl-code' or 'comment' and treats
text after an "__END__" or "__DATA__" token accordingly.  The default
value of 'perl-code' is useful for trailing POD and for AutoSplit
modules, the value 'comment' makes CPerl mode treat trailers as
comment, like Perl mode does.

*** New command 'cperl-file-style'.
This command sets the indentation style for the current buffer.  To
change the default style, either use the user option with the same name
or use the command 'cperl-set-style'.

*** New minor mode 'cperl-extra-paired-delimiters-mode'.
Perl 5.36 and newer allows using more than 200 non-ASCII paired
delimiters for quote-like constructs, e.g. "q«text»".  Use this minor
mode in buffers where this feature is activated.

*** Commands using the Perl Info manual are obsolete.
The Perl documentation in Info format is no longer distributed with
Perl or on CPAN since more than 10 years.  Perl documentation can be
read with 'cperl-perldoc' instead.

*** Highlighting trailing whitespace has been removed.
The user option 'cperl-invalid-face' is now obsolete, and does
nothing.  See the user option 'show-trailing-whitespace' instead.

** Emacs Sessions (Desktop)

*** Restoring buffers visiting remote files can now time out.
When a buffer is restored which visits a remote file, the restoration
of the session could hang if the remote host is off-line or slow to
respond.  Setting the user option 'remote-file-name-access-timeout' to
a positive number will abandon the attempt to restore such buffers
after a timeout of that many seconds, thus allowing the rest of
desktop restoration to continue.

** Recentf

*** Checking recent remote files can now time out.
Similarly to buffer restoration by Desktop, 'recentf-mode' checking
of the accessibility of remote files can now time out if
'remote-file-name-access-timeout' is set to a positive number.

** Image Dired

*** New user option 'image-dired-thumb-naming'.
You can now configure how thumbnails are named using this option.

** ERT

*** New macro 'skip-when' to skip 'ert-deftest' tests.
This can help to avoid some awkward skip conditions.  For example
'(skip-unless (not noninteractive))' can be changed to the easier
to read '(skip-when noninteractive)'.

*** Syntax highlighting unit testing support.
An ERT extension ('ert-font-lock') now provides support for face
assignment unit testing.  For more information, see the "(ert) Syntax
Highlighting Tests" node in the ERT manual.

** Socks

*** Socks supports version 4a.
The 'socks-server' user option accepts '4a' as a value for its version
field.

** Edmacro

*** New command 'edmacro-set-macro-to-region-lines'.
Bound to 'C-c C-r', this command replaces the macro text with the
lines of the region.  If needed, the region is extended to include
whole lines.  If the region ends at the beginning of a line, that last
line is excluded.

*** New user option 'edmacro-reverse-macro-lines'.
When this is non-nil, the lines of key sequences are displayed with
the most recent line first.  This is can be useful when working with
macros with many lines, such as from 'kmacro-edit-lossage'.

** Calc

*** Calc parses fractions written using U+2044 FRACTION SLASH.
Fractions of the form "123⁄456" are handled as if written "123:456".
Note in particular the difference in behavior from U+2215 DIVISION SLASH
and U+002F SOLIDUS, which result in division rather than a rational
fraction.  In addition, precomposed fraction characters, such as ½
(U+00BD VULGAR FRACTION ONE HALF), are also recognized as rational
fractions.  (They have been recognized since 2004, but it looks like it
was never mentioned in the NEWS, or even the Calc manual.)

** IELM

*** IELM now remembers input history between sessions.
The new user option 'ielm-history-file-name' is the name of the file
where IELM input history will be saved.  Customize it to nil to revert
to the old behavior of not remembering input history between sessions.

** EasyPG

*** New user option 'epa-keys-select-method'.
This allows the user to customize the key selection method, which can be
either by using a pop-up buffer or from the minibuffer.  The pop-up
buffer method is the default, which preserves previous behavior.

** Widget

*** New face 'widget-unselected'.
Customize this face to a non-default value to visually distinguish the
labels of unselected active radio-button or checkbox widgets from the
labels of unselected inactive widgets (the default value inherits from
the 'widget-inactive' face).

*** New user option 'widget-skip-inactive'.
If non-nil, moving point forward or backward between widgets by typing
'TAB' or 'S-TAB' skips over inactive widgets.  The default value is nil.

** Ruby mode

*** New user option 'ruby-rubocop-use-bundler'.
By default it retains the previous behavior: read the contents of
Gemfile and act accordingly.  But you can also set it to t or nil to
skip checking the Gemfile.

*** New user option 'ruby-bracketed-args-indent'.
When it is set to nil, multiple consecutive open braces/brackets/parens
result in only one additional indentation level.  Default is t.

** Thingatpt

*** New variables for providing custom thingatpt implementations.
The new variables 'bounds-of-thing-at-point-provider-alist' and
'forward-thing-provider-alist' now allow defining custom implementations
of 'bounds-of-thing-at-point' and 'forward-thing', respectively.

*** New helper functions for text property-based thingatpt providers.
The new helper functions 'thing-at-point-for-char-property',
'bounds-of-thing-at-point-for-char-property', and
'forward-thing-for-char-property' can help to implement custom thingatpt
providers for "things" that are defined by text properties.

*** 'bug-reference-mode' now supports 'thing-at-point'.
Now, calling '(thing-at-point 'url)' when point is on a bug reference
will return the URL for that bug.

** Buffer-menu

*** New user option 'Buffer-menu-group-by'.
It controls how buffers are divided into groups that are displayed with
headings using Outline minor mode.  Using commands that mark buffers
on the outline heading line will mark all buffers in the outline.  By
default, no grouping is performed.

*** New command 'Buffer-menu-toggle-internal'.
This command toggles the display of internal buffers in Buffer Menu mode;
that is, buffers not visiting a file and whose names start with a space.
Previously, such buffers were never shown.  This command is bound to 'I'
in Buffer Menu mode.

** Miscellaneous

*** New user option 'rcirc-log-time-format'.
This allows for rcirc logs to use a custom timestamp format, which the
chat buffers use by default.

*** 'ffap-lax-url' now defaults to nil.
Previously, it was set to t, but this broke remote file name detection.

*** More control on automatic update of Proced buffers.
The user option 'proced-auto-update-flag' can now be set to an
additional value 'visible', which controls automatic updates of Proced
buffers that are displayed in some window.

*** nXML Mode now comes with schemas for Mono/.NET development.
The following new XML schemas are now supported:
- MSBuild project files
- Dotnet package properties files
- Dotnet resource extension files
- Dotnet Application config files
- Nuget config file
- Nuget package specification file
- Nuget packages config file

*** color.el now supports the Oklab color representation.

*** New user option 'xwidget-webkit-disable-javascript'.
This allows disabling JavaScript in xwidget Webkit sessions.

*** 'ls-lisp--insert-directory' supports more long options of 'ls'.
'ls-lisp--insert-directory', the ls-lisp implementation of
'insert-directory', now supports the '--time=TIME' and '--sort=time'
options of GNU 'ls'.

*** 'M-x ping' can now give additional flags to the 'ping' program.
Typing 'C-u M-x ping' prompts first for the host, and then for the flags
to give to the 'ping' command.

*** Webjump now assumes URIs are HTTPS instead of HTTP.
For links in 'webjump-sites' without an explicit URI scheme, it was
previously assumed that they should be prefixed with "http://".  Such
URIs are now prefixed with "https://" instead.

*** Added prefixes in titdic-cnv library.
Most of the variables and functions in the file have been renamed to
make sure they all use a 'tit-' namespace prefix.

*** 'xref-revert-buffer' is now an alias of 'revert-buffer'.
The Xref buffer now sets up 'revert-buffer-function' such that
'revert-buffer' behaves like 'xref-revert-buffer' did in previous Emacs
versions, and the latter is now an alias of the former.

*** The Makefile browser is now obsolete.
The command 'makefile-switch-to-browser' command is now obsolete,
together with related commands used in the "*Macros and Targets*"
buffer.  We recommend using an alternative like 'imenu' instead.

*** 'jsonrpc-default-request-timeout' is now a defcustom.


* New Modes and Packages in Emacs 30.1

** New major modes based on the tree-sitter library

*** New major mode 'elixir-ts-mode'.
A major mode based on the tree-sitter library for editing Elixir files.

*** New major mode 'heex-ts-mode'.
A major mode based on the tree-sitter library for editing HEEx files.

*** New major mode 'html-ts-mode'.
An optional major mode based on the tree-sitter library for editing
HTML files.

*** New major mode 'lua-ts-mode'.
A major mode based on the tree-sitter library for editing Lua files.

*** New major mode 'php-ts-mode'.
A major mode based on the tree-sitter library for editing PHP files.

** New package EditorConfig.
This package provides support for the EditorConfig standard,
an editor-neutral way to provide directory local (project-wide) settings.
It is enabled via a new global minor mode 'editorconfig-mode'
which makes Emacs obey the '.editorconfig' files.
There is also a new major mode 'editorconfig-conf-mode'
to edit those configuration files.

** New global minor mode 'etags-regen-mode'.
This minor mode generates the tags table automatically based on the
current project configuration, and later updates it as you edit the
files and save the changes.

** New package 'which-key'.
The 'which-key' package from GNU ELPA is now included in Emacs.  It
implements the global minor mode 'which-key-mode' that displays a table
of key bindings upon entering a partial key chord and waiting for a
moment.  For example, after enabling the minor mode, if you enter 'C-x'
and wait for one second, the minibuffer will expand with all available
key bindings that follow 'C-x' (or as many as space allows).

** New minor mode 'completion-preview-mode'.
This minor mode shows you symbol completion suggestions as you type,
using an inline preview.  New user options in the 'completion-preview'
customization group control exactly when Emacs displays this preview.
'completion-preview-mode' is buffer-local, to enable it globally use
'global-completion-preview-mode'.

** New package Window-Tool-Bar.
This provides a new minor mode, 'window-tool-bar-mode'.  When this minor
mode is enabled, a tool bar is displayed at the top of a window.  To
conserve space, no tool bar is shown if 'tool-bar-map' is nil.  The
global minor mode 'global-window-tool-bar-mode' enables this minor mode
in all buffers.

** New library Track-Changes.
This library is a layer of abstraction above 'before-change-functions'
and 'after-change-functions' which provides a superset of
the functionality of 'after-change-functions':
- It provides the actual previous text rather than only its length.
- It takes care of accumulating and bundling changes until a time when
  its client finds it convenient to react to them.
- It detects most cases where some changes were not properly
  reported (calls to 'before/after-change-functions' that are
  incorrectly paired, missing, etc...) and reports them adequately.

** New global minor mode 'minibuffer-regexp-mode'.
This is a minor mode for editing regular expressions in the minibuffer,
for example in 'query-replace-regexp'.  It correctly highlights parens
via 'show-paren-mode' and 'blink-matching-paren' in a user-friendly way,
avoids reporting alleged paren mismatches and makes sexp navigation more
intuitive.  It is enabled by default, 'minibuffer-regexp-prompts' can be
used to tune when it takes effect.

** The highly accessible Modus themes collection has eight items.
The 'modus-operandi' and 'modus-vivendi' are the main themes that have
been part of Emacs since version 28.  The former is light, the latter
dark.  In addition to these, we now have 'modus-operandi-tinted' and
'modus-vivendi-tinted' for easier legibility, as well as
'modus-operandi-deuteranopia', 'modus-vivendi-deuteranopia',
'modus-operandi-tritanopia', and 'modus-vivendi-tritanopia' to cover
the needs of users with red-green or blue-yellow color deficiency.
The Info manual "(modus-themes) Top" describes the details and
showcases all their user options.

** New library PEG.
Emacs now includes a library for writing Parsing Expression
Grammars (PEG), an approach to text parsing that provides more structure
than regular expressions, but less complexity than context-free
grammars.  The Info manual "(elisp) Parsing Expression Grammars" has
documentation and examples.

** New major mode 'shell-command-mode'.
This mode is used by default for the output of asynchronous 'shell-command'.
To revert to the previous behavior, set the (also new) variable
'async-shell-command-mode' to 'shell-mode'.  Any hooks or mode-specific
variables used should be adapted appropriately.

** New package Compat.
Emacs now comes with a stub implementation of the
forwards-compatibility Compat package from GNU ELPA.  This allows
built-in packages to use the library more effectively, and helps
preventing the installation of Compat if unnecessary.


* Incompatible Lisp Changes in Emacs 30.1

** Evaluating a 'lambda' returns an object of type 'interpreted-function'.
Instead of representing interpreted functions as lists that start with
either 'lambda' or 'closure', Emacs now represents them as objects
of their own 'interpreted-function' type, which is very similar
to 'byte-code-function' objects (the argument list, docstring, and
interactive forms are placed in the same slots).
Lists that start with 'lambda' are now used only for non-evaluated
functions (in other words, for source code), but for backward compatibility
reasons, 'functionp' still recognizes them as functions and you can
still call them as before.
Thus code that attempts to "dig" into the internal structure of an
interpreted function's object with the likes of 'car' or 'cdr' will
no longer work and will need to use 'aref' instead to extract its
various subparts (when 'interactive-form', 'documentation', and
'help-function-arglist' aren't adequate).

** The escape sequence '\x' not followed by hex digits is now an error.
Previously, '\x' without at least one hex digit denoted character code
zero (NUL) but as this was neither intended nor documented or even
known by anyone, it is now treated as an error by the Lisp reader.

** 'subr-native-elisp-p' is renamed to 'native-comp-function-p'.
The previous name still exists but is marked as obsolete.

** 'define-globalized-minor-mode' requires that modes use 'run-mode-hooks'.
Minor modes defined with 'define-globalized-minor-mode', such as
'global-font-lock-mode', will not be enabled any more in those buffers
whose major modes fail to use 'run-mode-hooks'.  Major modes defined
with 'define-derived-mode' are not affected.  'run-mode-hooks' has been the
recommended way to run major mode hooks since Emacs 22.

** 'buffer-match-p' and 'match-buffers' take '&rest ARGS'.
They used to take a single '&optional ARG' and were documented to use
an unreliable hack to try and support condition predicates that
don't accept this optional ARG.
The new semantics makes no such accommodation, but the code still
supports it (with a warning) for backward compatibility.

** 'post-gc-hook' runs after updating 'gcs-done' and 'gc-elapsed'.

** Connection-local variables are applied in buffers visiting remote files.
This overrides possible directory-local or file-local variables with
the same name.

** 'copy-tree' now copies records when its optional 2nd argument is non-nil.

** Regexp zero-width assertions followed by operators are better defined.
Previously, regexps such as "xy\\B*" would have ill-defined behavior.
Now any operator following a zero-width assertion applies to that
assertion only (which is useless).  For historical compatibility, an
operator character following '^' or '\`' becomes literal, but we
advise against relying on this.

** Infinities and NaNs no longer act as symbols on non-IEEE platforms.
On old platforms like the VAX that do not support IEEE floating-point,
tokens like '0.0e+NaN' and '1.0e+INF' are no longer read as symbols.
Instead, the Lisp reader approximates an infinity with the nearest
finite value, and a NaN with some other non-numeric object that
provokes an error if used numerically.

** Conversion of strings to and from byte-arrays works with multibyte strings.
The functions 'dbus-string-to-byte-array' and
'dbus-byte-array-to-string' now accept and return multibyte Lisp
strings, encoding to UTF-8 and decoding from UTF-8 internally.  This
means that the argument to 'dbus-byte-array-to-string' must be a valid
UTF-8 byte sequence, and the optional parameter MULTIBYTE of
'dbus-byte-array-to-string' is now obsolete and unused.  The argument of
'dbus-string-to-byte-array' should be a regular Lisp string, not a
unibyte string.

** 'minibuffer-allow-text-properties' now can be set buffer-local.
'read-from-minibuffer' and functions that use it can take the
buffer-local value from the minibuffer.

** 'minibuffer-allow-text-properties' now also affects completions.
When it has a non-nil value, then completion functions like
'completing-read' don't discard text properties from the returned
completion candidate.

** X color support compatibility aliases are now obsolete.
The compatibility aliases 'x-defined-colors', 'x-color-defined-p',
'x-color-values', and 'x-display-color-p' are now obsolete.

** 'easy-mmode-define-{minor,global}-mode' aliases are now obsolete.
Use 'define-minor-mode' and 'define-globalized-minor-mode' instead.

** The 'millisec' argument of 'sleep-for' is now obsolete.
Use a float value for the first argument instead.

** User options 'eshell-NAME-unload-hook' are now obsolete.
These hooks were named incorrectly, and so they never actually ran
when unloading the corresponding feature.  Instead, you should use
hooks named after the feature name, like 'esh-mode-unload-hook'.

** User options 'eshell-process-wait-{seconds,milliseconds}' are now obsolete.
Instead, use 'eshell-process-wait-time', which supports floating-point
values.

** User option 'tramp-completion-reread-directory-timeout' has been removed.
This user option was obsoleted in Emacs 27, use
'remote-file-name-inhibit-cache' instead.

** The obsolete calling convention of 'sit-for' has been removed.
That convention was: '(sit-for SECONDS MILLISEC &optional NODISP)'.

** 'defadvice' is marked as obsolete.
See the "(elisp) Porting Old Advice" Info node for help converting
them to use 'advice-add' or 'define-advice' instead.

** 'cl-old-struct-compat-mode' is marked as obsolete.
You may need to recompile your code if it was compiled with Emacs < 24.3.

** Old derived.el functions removed.
The following functions have been deleted because they were only used
by code compiled with Emacs < 21:
'derived-mode-init-mode-variables', 'derived-mode-merge-abbrev-tables',
'derived-mode-merge-keymaps', 'derived-mode-merge-syntax-tables',
'derived-mode-run-hooks', 'derived-mode-set-abbrev-table',
'derived-mode-set-keymap', 'derived-mode-set-syntax-table',
'derived-mode-setup-function-name'.


* Lisp Changes in Emacs 30.1

** The 'wheel-up/down/left/right' events are now bound unconditionally.
The 'mouse-wheel-up/down/left/right-event' variables are thus used only
to specify the 'mouse-4/5/6/7' events that might still happen to be
generated by some old packages (or if 'mouse-wheel-buttons' has been set
to nil).

** Xterm Mouse mode now emits 'wheel-up/down/right/left' events.
This is instead of 'mouse-4/5/6/7' events for the mouse wheel.  It uses
the new variable 'mouse-wheel-buttons' to decide which button maps to
which wheel event (if any).

** In batch mode, tracing now sends the trace to stdout.

** New hook 'hack-dir-local-get-variables-functions'.
This can be used to provide support for other directory-local settings
beside ".dir-locals.el".

** 'auto-coding-functions' can know the name of the file.
The functions on this hook can now find the name of the file to
which the text belongs by consulting the variable 'auto-coding-file-name'.

** New user option 'compilation-safety' to control safety of native code.
It is now possible to control how safe is the code generated by native
compilation, by customizing this user option.  It is also possible to
control this at function granularity by using the new 'safety' parameter
in the function's 'declare' form.

** New types 'closure' and 'interpreted-function'.
'interpreted-function' is the new type used for interpreted functions,
and 'closure' is the common parent type of 'interpreted-function'
and 'byte-code-function'.

Those new types come with the associated new predicates 'closurep' and
'interpreted-function-p' as well as a new constructor
'make-interpreted-closure'.

** New function 'help-fns-function-name'.
For named functions, it just returns the name and otherwise
it returns a short "unique" string that identifies the function.
In either case, the string is propertized so clicking on it gives
further details.

** New function 'char-to-name'.
This is a convenience function to return the Unicode name of a char (if
it has one).

** New function 'cl-type-of'.
This function is like 'type-of' except that it sometimes returns
a more precise type.  For example, for nil and t it returns 'null'
and 'boolean' respectively, instead of just 'symbol'.

** New functions 'primitive-function-p' and 'cl-functionp'.
'primitive-function-p' is like 'subr-primitive-p' except that it returns
t only if the argument is a function rather than a special-form,
and 'cl-functionp' is like 'functionp' except it returns nil
for lists and symbols.

** Built-in types now have corresponding classes.
At the Lisp level, this means that things like '(cl-find-class 'integer)'
will now return a class object, and at the UI level it means that
things like 'C-h o integer RET' will show some information about that type.

** New variable 'major-mode-remap-defaults' and function 'major-mode-remap'.
The first is like Emacs-29's 'major-mode-remap-alist' but to be set by
packages (instead of users).  The second looks up those two variables.

** Pcase's functions (in 'pred' and 'app') can specify the argument position.
For example, instead of '(pred (< 5))' you can write '(pred (> _ 5))'.

** 'define-advice' now sets the new advice's 'name' property to NAME.
Named advices defined with 'define-advice' can now be removed with
'(advice-remove SYMBOL NAME)' in addition to '(advice-remove SYMBOL
SYMBOL@NAME)'.

** New function 'require-with-check' to detect new versions shadowing.
This is like 'require', but it checks whether the argument 'feature'
is already loaded, in which case it either signals an error or
forcibly reloads the file that defines the feature.

** New variable 'lisp-eval-depth-reserve'.
It puts a limit to the amount by which Emacs can temporarily increase
'max-lisp-eval-depth' when handling signals.

** New special form 'handler-bind'.
It provides a functionality similar to 'condition-case' except it runs
the handler code without unwinding the stack, such that we can record
the backtrace and other dynamic state at the point of the error.  See
the Info node "(elisp) Handling Errors".

** New text properties add tooltips on fringes.
It is now possible to provide tooltips on fringes by adding special text
properties 'left-fringe-help' and 'right-fringe-help'.  See the "(elisp)
Special Properties" Info node in the Emacs Lisp Reference Manual for
more details.

** New 'display-buffer' action alist entry 'pop-up-frames'.
This has the same effect as the variable of the same name and takes
precedence over the variable when present.

** New function 'merge-ordered-lists'.
Mostly used internally to do a kind of topological sort of
inheritance hierarchies.

** 'drop' is now an alias for the function 'nthcdr'.

** New polymorphic comparison function 'value<'.
This function returns non-nil if the first argument is less than the
second.  It works for any two values of the same type with reasonable
ordering for numbers, strings, symbols, bool-vectors, markers, buffers
and processes.  Conses, lists, vectors and records are ordered
lexicographically.
It is intended as a convenient ordering predicate for sorting, and is
likely to be faster than hand-written Lisp functions.

** New 'sort' arguments and features.
The 'sort' function can now be called using the signature

    (sort SEQ &rest KEYWORD-ARGUMENTS)

where arguments after the first are keyword/value pairs, all optional:
':key' specifies a function that produces the sorting key from an element,
':lessp' specifies the ordering predicate, defaulting to 'value<',
':reverse' is used to reverse the sorting order,
':in-place' is used for in-place sorting, as the default is now to
sort a copy of the input.

The new signature is less error-prone and reduces the need to write
ordering predicates by hand.  We recommend that you use the ':key'
argument instead of ':lessp' unless a suitable ordering predicate is
already available.  This can also be used for multi-key sorting:

    (sort seq :key (lambda (x) (list (age x) (size x) (cost x))))

sorts by the return value of 'age', then by 'size', then by 'cost'.

The old signature, '(sort SEQ PREDICATE)', can still be used and sorts
its input in-place as before.

** New API for 'derived-mode-p' and control of the graph of major modes

*** 'derived-mode-p' now takes the list of modes as a single argument.
The same holds for 'provided-mode-derived-p'.
The old calling convention where multiple modes are passed as
separate arguments is deprecated.

*** New functions to access the graph of major modes.
While 'define-derived-mode' still only supports single inheritance,
modes can declare additional parents (for tests like 'derived-mode-p')
with 'derived-mode-add-parents'.
Accessing the 'derived-mode-parent' property directly is now
deprecated in favor of the new functions 'derived-mode-set-parent'
and 'derived-mode-all-parents'.

** Drag-and-drop functions can now be called once for compound drops.
It is now possible for drag-and-drop handler functions to respond to
drops incorporating more than one URL.  Functions capable of this must
set their 'dnd-multiple-handler' symbol properties to a non-nil value.
See the Info node "(elisp) Drag and Drop".

The function 'dnd-handle-one-url' has been made obsolete, since it
cannot take these new handlers into account.

** 'notifications-notify' can use Icon Naming Specification for ':app-icon'.
You can use a symbol as the value for ':app-icon' to provide icon name
without specifying a file, like this:

    (notifications-notify
      :title "I am playing music" :app-icon 'multimedia-player)

** New function 're-disassemble' to see the innards of a regexp.
If you built Emacs with '--enable-checking', you can use this to help
debug either your regexp performance problems or the regexp engine.

** XLFDs are no longer restricted to 255 characters.
'font-xlfd-name' now returns an XLFD even if it is greater than 255
characters in length, provided that the LONG_XLFDs argument is true.
Other features in Emacs which employ XLFDs have been modified to
produce and understand XLFDs larger than 255 characters.

** New macro 'static-if' for conditional evaluation of code.
This macro hides a form from the evaluator or byte-compiler based on a
compile-time condition.  This is handy for avoiding byte-compilation
warnings about code that will never actually run under some conditions.

** Desktop notifications are now supported on the Haiku operating system.
The new function 'haiku-notifications-notify' provides a subset of the
capabilities of the 'notifications-notify' function in a manner
analogous to 'w32-notification-notify'.

** New Haiku specific variable 'haiku-pass-control-tab-to-system'.
This sets whether Emacs should pass 'C-TAB' on to the system instead of
handling it, fixing a problem where window switching would not activate
if an Emacs frame had focus on the Haiku operating system.  Default
value is t.

** New value 'if-regular' for the REPLACE argument to 'insert-file-contents'.
It results in 'insert-file-contents' erasing the buffer instead of
preserving markers if the file being inserted is not a regular file,
rather than signaling an error.

** New variable 'current-key-remap-sequence'.
It is bound to the key sequence that caused a call to a function bound
within 'function-key-map' or 'input-decode-map' around those calls.

** The function 'key-translate' can now remove translations.
If the second argument TO is nil, the existing key translation is
removed.

** New variables describing the names of built in programs.
The new variables 'ctags-program-name', 'ebrowse-program-name',
'etags-program-name', 'hexl-program-name', 'emacsclient-program-name'
'movemail-program-name', and 'rcs2log-program-name' should be used
instead of "ctags", "ebrowse", "etags", "hexl", "emacsclient", and
"rcs2log", when starting one of these built in programs in a subprocess.

** New variable 'case-symbols-as-words' affects case operations for symbols.
If non-nil, then case operations such as 'upcase-initials' or
'replace-match' (with nil FIXEDCASE) will treat the entire symbol name
as a single word.  This is useful for programming languages and styles
where only the first letter of a symbol's name is ever capitalized.
The default value of this variable is nil.

** Bytecode is now always loaded eagerly.
Bytecode compiled with older Emacs versions for lazy loading using
'byte-compile-dynamic' is now loaded all at once.
As a consequence, 'fetch-bytecode' has no use, does nothing, and is
now obsolete.  The variable 'byte-compile-dynamic' has no effect any
more; compilation will always yield bytecode for eager loading.

** Returned strings from functions and macros are never docstrings.
Functions and macros whose bodies consist of a single string literal now
only return that string, and will not use it as a docstring.  Example:

    (defun sing-a-song ()
      "Sing a song.")

The above function returns the string "Sing a song." and has no
docstring.  Previously, that string was used as both the docstring and
return value, which was never what the programmer wanted.  If you want
the string to be a docstring, add an explicit return value.

This change applies to 'defun', 'defsubst', 'defmacro' and 'lambda'
forms; other defining forms such as 'cl-defun' already worked this way.

** New or changed byte-compilation warnings

*** Warn about missing 'lexical-binding' directive.
The compiler now warns if an Elisp file lacks the standard
'-*- lexical-binding: ... -*-' cookie on the first line.
This line typically looks something like

    ;;; My little pony mode  -*- lexical-binding: t -*-

It is needed to inform the compiler about which dialect of Elisp
your code is using: the modern dialect with lexical binding or
the old dialect with only dynamic binding.

Lexical binding avoids some name conflicts and allows the compiler to
detect more mistakes and generate more efficient code, so it is
recommended.  For how to adapt your code to lexical binding, see the
manual section "(elisp) Converting to Lexical Binding".

If your code cannot be converted to lexical binding, you can insert
the line

    ;;; -*- lexical-binding: nil -*-

first in the file to declare that it uses the old dialect.

*** Warn about empty bodies for more special forms and macros.
The compiler now warns about an empty body argument to 'when',
'unless', 'ignore-error' and 'with-suppressed-warnings' in addition to
the existing warnings for 'let' and 'let*'.  Example:

    (when (> x 2))

This warning can be suppressed using 'with-suppressed-warnings' with
the warning name 'empty-body'.

*** Warn about quoted error names in 'condition-case' and 'ignore-error'.
The compiler now warns about quoted condition (error) names
in 'condition-case' and 'ignore-error'.  Example:

    (condition-case nil
        (/ x y)
      ('arith-error "division by zero"))

Quoting them adds the error name 'quote' to those handled or ignored
respectively, which was probably not intended.

*** Warn about comparison with literal constants without defined identity.
The compiler now warns about comparisons by identity with a literal
string, cons, vector, record, function, large integer or float as this
may not match any value at all.  Example:

    (eq x "hello")

Only literals for symbols and small integers (fixnums), including
characters, are guaranteed to have a consistent (unique) identity.
This warning applies to 'eq', 'eql', 'memq', 'memql', 'assq', 'rassq',
'remq' and 'delq'.

To compare by (structural) value, use 'equal', 'member', 'assoc',
'rassoc', 'remove' or 'delete' instead.  Floats and bignums can also
be compared using 'eql', '=' and 'memql'.  Function literals cannot be
compared reliably at all.

This warning can be suppressed using 'with-suppressed-warnings' with
the warning name 'suspicious'.

*** Warn about 'condition-case' without handlers.
The compiler now warns when the 'condition-case' form is used without
any actual handlers, as in

    (condition-case nil (read buffer))

because it has no effect other than the execution of the body form.
In particular, no errors are caught or suppressed.  If the intention
was to catch all errors, add an explicit handler for 'error', or use
'ignore-error' or 'ignore-errors'.

This warning can be suppressed using 'with-suppressed-warnings' with
the warning name 'suspicious'.

*** Warn about 'unwind-protect' without unwind forms.
The compiler now warns when the 'unwind-protect' form is used without
any unwind forms, as in

    (unwind-protect (read buffer))

because the behavior is identical to that of the argument; there is
no protection of any kind.  Perhaps the intended unwind forms have
been misplaced or forgotten, or the use of 'unwind-protect' could be
simplified away.

This warning can be suppressed using 'with-suppressed-warnings' with
the warning name 'suspicious'.

*** Warn about useless trailing 'cond' clauses.
The compiler now warns when a 'cond' form contains clauses following a
default (unconditional) clause.  Example:

    (cond ((= x 0) (say "none"))
          (t (say "some"))
          (say "goodbye"))

Such a clause will never be executed, and is likely to be a mistake,
perhaps due to misplaced parens.

This warning can be suppressed using 'with-suppressed-warnings' with
the warning name 'suspicious'.

*** Warn about mutation of constant values.
The compiler now warns about code that modifies program constants in
some obvious cases.  Examples:

    (setcar '(1 2) 7)
    (aset [3 4] 0 8)
    (aset "abc" 1 ?d)

Such code may have unpredictable behavior because the constants are part
of the program and are not data structures generated afresh during
execution; the compiler does not expect them to change.

To avoid the warning, operate on an object created by the program
(maybe a copy of the constant), or use a non-destructive operation
instead.

This warning can be suppressed using 'with-suppressed-warnings' with
the warning name 'mutate-constant'.

*** Warn about more ignored function return values.
The compiler now warns when the return value from certain functions is
implicitly ignored.  Example:

    (progn (nreverse my-list) my-list)

will elicit a warning because it is usually pointless to call
'nreverse' on a list without using the returned value.

To silence the warning, make use of the value in some way, such as
assigning it to a variable.  You can also wrap the function call in
'(ignore ...)', or use 'with-suppressed-warnings' with the warning
name 'ignored-return-value'.

The warning will only be issued for calls to functions declared
'important-return-value' or 'side-effect-free' (but not 'error-free').

*** Warn about docstrings that contain control characters.
The compiler now warns about docstrings with control characters other
than newline and tab.  This is often a result of improper escaping.
Example:

    (defun my-fun ()
      "Uses c:\remote\dir\files and the key \C-x."
      ...)

where the docstring contains the four control characters 'CR', 'DEL',
'FF' and 'C-x'.

The warning name is 'docstrings-control-chars'.

*** The warning about wide docstrings can now be disabled separately.
Its warning name is 'docstrings-wide'.

** 'fset', 'defalias' and 'defvaralias' now signal an error for cyclic aliases.
Previously, 'fset', 'defalias' and 'defvaralias' could be made to
build circular function and variable indirection chains as in

    (defalias 'able 'baker)
    (defalias 'baker 'able)

but trying to use them would sometimes make Emacs hang.  Now, an attempt
to create such a loop results in an error.

Since circular alias chains now cannot occur, 'function-alias-p',
'indirect-function' and 'indirect-variable' will never signal an error.
Their 'noerror' arguments have no effect and are therefore obsolete.

** Touch Screen support

*** 'x-popup-menu' now understands touch screen events.
When a 'touchscreen-begin' or 'touchscreen-end' event is passed as the
POSITION argument, it will behave as if that event was a mouse event.

*** New functions for handling touch screen events.
The new functions 'touch-screen-track-tap' and 'touch-screen-track-drag'
handle tracking common touch screen gestures from within a command.

*** New parameter to 'touchscreen-end' events.
CANCEL non-nil establishes that the touch sequence has been intercepted
by programs such as window managers and should be ignored with Emacs.

** New variable 'inhibit-auto-fill' to temporarily prevent auto-fill.

** New variable 'secondary-tool-bar-map'.
If non-nil, this variable contains a keymap of menu items that are
displayed along tool bar items defined by 'tool-bar-map'.  These items
are displayed below the tool bar if the value of 'tool-bar-position' is
'top', and above it if the value is 'bottom'.  This is used by
'modifier-bar-mode'.

** New variable 'completion-lazy-hilit'.
Lisp programs that present completion candidates may bind this
variable non-nil around calls to functions such as
'completion-all-completions'.  This tells the underlying completion
styles to skip eager fontification of completion candidates, which
improves performance.  Such a Lisp program can then use the
'completion-lazy-hilit' function to fontify candidates just in time.

** New primitive 'buffer-last-name'.
It returns the name of a buffer before the last time it was renamed or
killed.

** New primitive 'marker-last-position'.
It returns the last position of a marker in its buffer even if that
buffer has been killed.  ('marker-position' would return nil in that
case.)

** Functions and variables to transpose sexps

*** New helper variable 'transpose-sexps-function'.
Lisp programs can now set this variable to customize the behavior of the
'transpose-sexps' command.

*** New function 'transpose-sexps-default-function'.
The previous implementation of 'transpose-sexps' was moved into its own
function, to be used in 'transpose-sexps-function'.

*** New function 'treesit-transpose-sexps'.
Tree-sitter now unconditionally sets 'transpose-sexps-function' for all
tree-sitter enabled modes to this function.

** Functions and variables to move by program statements

*** New variable 'forward-sentence-function'.
Major modes can now set this variable to customize the behavior of the
'forward-sentence' command.

*** New function 'forward-sentence-default-function'.
The previous implementation of 'forward-sentence' is moved into its
own function, to be bound by 'forward-sentence-function'.

*** New function 'treesit-forward-sentence'.
All tree-sitter enabled modes that define 'sentence' in
'treesit-thing-settings' now set 'forward-sentence-function' to call
'treesit-forward-sentence'.

** Functions and variables to move by program sexps

*** New function 'treesit-forward-sexp'.
Tree-sitter conditionally sets 'forward-sexp-function' for major modes
that have defined 'sexp' in 'treesit-thing-settings' to enable
sexp-related motion commands.

** New user option 'native-comp-async-warnings-errors-kind'.
It allows control of what kinds of warnings and errors from asynchronous
native compilation are reported to the parent Emacs process.  The
default is to report all errors and only important warnings.  If you
were used to customizing 'native-comp-async-report-warnings-errors' to
nil or 'silent', we suggest that you now leave it at its default value,
and see if you get only warnings that matter.

** Function 'declare' forms

*** New 'ftype' function declaration.
The declaration '(ftype TYPE)' specifies the type of a function.
Example:

    (defun hello (x y)
      (declare (ftype (function (integer boolean) string)))
      ...)

specifies that the function takes two arguments, an integer and a
boolean, and returns a string.  If the compilation happens with
'compilation-safety' set to zero, this information can be used by the
native compiler to produce better code, but specifying an incorrect type
may lead to Emacs crashing.  See the Info node "(elisp) Declare Form"
for further information.

*** New 'important-return-value' function declaration and property.
The declaration '(important-return-value t)' sets the
'important-return-value' property which indicates that the function
return value should probably not be thrown away implicitly.

** New functions 'file-user-uid' and 'file-group-gid'.
These functions are like 'user-uid' and 'group-gid', respectively, but
are aware of file name handlers, so they will return the remote UID or
GID for remote files (or -1 if the connection has no associated user).

** 'treesit-font-lock-rules' now accepts additional global keywords.
When supplied with ':default-language LANGUAGE', rules after it will
default to use 'LANGUAGE'.

** New optional argument to 'modify-dir-local-variable'.
An optional 5th argument FILE has been added to
'modify-dir-local-variable'.  It can be used to specify which file to
modify instead of the default ".dir-locals.el".

** Connection local variables

*** New macros 'connection-local-p' and 'connection-local-value'.
The former macro returns non-nil if a variable has a connection-local
binding.  The latter macro returns the connection-local value of a
variable if any, or its current value.

** Hash tables

*** ':rehash-size' and ':rehash-threshold' args no longer have any effect.
These keyword arguments are now ignored by 'make-hash-table'.  Emacs
manages the memory for all hash table objects in the same way.
The functions 'hash-table-rehash-size' and 'hash-table-rehash-threshold'
remain for compatibility but now always return the old default values.

*** The printed representation has been shrunk and simplified.
The 'test' parameter is omitted if it is 'eql' (the default), as is
'data' if empty.  'rehash-size', 'rehash-threshold' and 'size' are
always omitted, and ignored if present when the object is read back in.

** Obarrays

*** New obarray type.
Obarrays are now represented by an opaque type instead of using vectors.
They are created by 'obarray-make' and manage their internal storage
automatically, which means that the size parameter to 'obarray-make' can
safely be omitted.  That is, they do not become slower as they fill up.

The old vector representation is still accepted by functions operating
on obarrays, but 'obarrayp' only returns t for obarray objects.
'type-of' now returns 'obarray' for obarray objects.

Old code which (incorrectly) created "obarrays" as Lisp vectors filled
with something other than 0, as in '(make-vector N nil)', will no longer
work, and should be rewritten to use 'obarray-make'.  Alternatively, you
can fill the vector with 0.

*** New function 'obarray-clear' removes all symbols from an obarray.

*** 'obarray-size' and 'obarray-default-size' are now obsolete.
They pertained to the internal storage size which is now irrelevant.

** 'treesit-install-language-grammar' can handle local directory instead of URL.
It is now possible to pass a directory of a local repository as URL
inside 'treesit-language-source-alist', so that calling
'treesit-install-language-grammar' will avoid cloning the repository.
It may be useful, for example, for the purposes of bisecting a
treesitter grammar.

** New buffer-local variable 'tabulated-list-groups'.
It controls display and separate sorting of groups of entries.  By
default no grouping or sorting is done.

** New variable 'revert-buffer-restore-functions'.
It helps to preserve various states after reverting the buffer.

** New text property 'context-menu-functions'.
Like the variable with the same name, it adds menus from the list that
is the value of the property to context menus shown when clicking on the
text which as this property.

** Detecting the end of an iteration of a keyboard macro.
'read-event', 'read-char', and 'read-char-exclusive' no longer return -1
when called at the end of an iteration of the execution of a keyboard
macro.  Instead, they will transparently continue reading available input
(e.g., from the keyboard).  If you need to detect the end of a macro
iteration, check the following condition before calling one of the
aforementioned functions:

    (and (arrayp executing-kbd-macro)
         (>= executing-kbd-macro-index (length executing-kbd-macro)))

** 'vtable-update-object' updates an existing object with just two arguments.
It is now possible to update the representation of an object in a vtable
by calling 'vtable-update-object' with just the vtable and the object as
arguments.  (Previously, the OLD-OBJECT argument was required which, in
this case, would mean repeating the object in the argument list.)  When
replacing an object with a different one, passing both the new and old
objects is still necessary.

** 'vtable-insert-object' can insert "before" or at an index.
The signature of 'vtable-insert-object' has changed and is now:

    (vtable-insert-object TABLE OBJECT &optional LOCATION BEFORE)

LOCATION corresponds to the old AFTER-OBJECT argument; if BEFORE is
non-nil, the new object is inserted before the LOCATION object, making
it possible to insert a new object at the top of the table.  (Before,
this was not possible.)  In addition, LOCATION can be an integer, a
(zero-based) index into the table at which the new object is inserted
(BEFORE is ignored in this case).

** New function 'sqlite-execute-batch'.
This function lets the user execute multiple SQL statements in one go.
It is useful, for example, when a Lisp program needs to evaluate an
entire SQL file.

** JSON

*** 'json-serialize' now always returns a unibyte string.
This is appropriate since it is an encoding operation.  In the unlikely
event that a multibyte string is needed, the result can be decoded using

    (decode-coding-string RESULT 'utf-8)

*** The parser keeps duplicated object keys in alist and plist output.
A JSON object such as '{"a":1,"a":2}' will now be translated into the
Lisp values '((a . 1) (a . 2))' or '(:a 1 :a 2)' if alist or plist
object types are requested.

*** The parser sometimes signals different types of errors.
It will now signal 'json-utf8-decode-error' for inputs that are not
correctly UTF-8 encoded.

*** The parser and encoder now accept arbitrarily large integers.
Previously, they were limited to the range of signed 64-bit integers.

** New tree-sitter functions and variables for defining and using "things"

*** New variable 'treesit-thing-settings'.
It allows modes to define "things" like 'defun', 'text', 'sexp', and
'sentence' for navigation commands and tree-traversal functions.

*** New functions for navigating "things".
There are new navigation functions 'treesit-thing-prev',
'treesit-thing-next', 'treesit-navigate-thing',
'treesit-beginning-of-thing', and 'treesit-end-of-thing'.

*** New functions 'treesit-thing-at', 'treesit-thing-at-point'.

*** Tree-traversing functions.
The functions 'treesit-search-subtree', 'treesit-search-forward',
'treesit-search-forward-goto', and 'treesit-induce-sparse-tree' now
accept more kinds of predicates.  Lisp programs can now use thing
symbols (defined in 'treesit-thing-settings') and any thing definitions
for the predicate argument.

** Other tree-sitter function and variable changes

*** 'treesit-parser-list' now takes additional optional arguments.
The additional arguments are LANGUAGE and TAG.  If LANGUAGE is given,
only return parsers for that language.  If TAG is given, only return
parsers with that tag.  Note that passing nil as tag doesn't mean return
all parsers, but rather "all parsers with no tags".

*** New variable 'treesit-primary-parser'.
This variable should be set by multi-language major modes before calling
'treesit-major-mode-setup', in order for tree-sitter integration
functionalities to operate correctly.


* Changes in Emacs 30.1 on Non-Free Operating Systems

** MS-Windows

*** You can now opt out of following MS-Windows' Dark mode.
By default, Emacs on MS-Windows follows the system's Dark mode for its
title bars' and scroll bars' appearance.  If the new user option
'w32-follow-system-dark-mode' is customized to the nil value, Emacs
will disregard the system's Dark mode and will always use the default
Light mode.

*** You can now use Image-Dired even if the 'convert' program is not installed.
If you don't have GraphicsMagick or ImageMagick installed, and thus the
'gm convert'/'convert' program is not available, Emacs on MS-Windows
will now use its own function 'w32image-create-thumbnail' to create
thumbnail images and show them in the thumbnail buffer.  Unlike with
using 'convert', this fallback method is synchronous, so Emacs will wait
until all the thumbnails are created and displayed, before showing them.

*** Emacs on MS-Windows now supports the ':stipple' face attribute.
