* Changes in upcoming Eglot


* Changes in Eglot 1.18 (20/1/2025)

** 'eglot-managed-mode-hook' now run when turning off Eglot (bug#70958)

** Better handling of 'eglot-report-progress'

Eglot no longer advertises the 'workDoneProgress' capability when this
customization variable is set to nil.  This requires a restart of the
server for the change to take effect.

** LSP MarkedString interface is now supported (bug#71353)

Some servers still use this deprecated interface for communicating
documentation snippets.

** Fixes to completion logic (bug#68699, github#1339, github#1349)

These affect mostly the "vanilla" frontend to completions (invoked with
C-M-i).

** More strict completion expansion (bug#72705).

Ensures that "expand common" commands (such as C-M-i or TAB in
third-party frontends) don't result in fewer completions than before
they are called.

** More robust completion results when typing quickly (github#1474, bug#73279)

** Support for 'InsertReplaceEdit' objects (bug#73857)

This allows servers such as Zig's 'zls' to behave better when completion
starts from the middle of an incomplete symbol.

** Experimental support for Eglot-only subprojects (github#1337)

Useful for complex projects with subprojects needing different language
servers.  See associated github issue
https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot/discussions/1337 for examples.

** Support nested {} in server-provided globs (github#1403)

In short, play nice with 'tailwindcss-language-server' which seems to
use this.

** Eglot commands have a 'command-modes' property (bug#70554)

** Fix to function signature display (bug#74914)

** Fix command execution (bug#71642)

** New servers have been added to 'eglot-server-programs'.

- blueprint (bug#70015)
- BasedPyright (bug#69925)
- move-analyzer (bug#69796)
- millet
- nushell (bug#68823)

** Eglot uses an internal 'track-changes.el' library (bug#70077)

This should in theory help smoothen the Eglot's handling of events that
change the buffer.  The library has been problematic in the past, let's
hope we're past that phase.


* Changes in Eglot 1.17 (25/1/2024)

** Fixes to completion (github#847, github#1349)

** Fix code-action gathering for some servers (github#847)

** Experimental support for Eglot-only subprojects

Until project.el's support for subprojects improves, github#1337
describes a reasonably sane way to configure nested sub-projects
within a larger one just for Eglot purposes.


* Changes in Eglot 1.16 (27/12/2023)

** Code actions can be previewed in diff format

The variable 'eglot-confirm-server-edits' replaces the obsolete
'eglot-confirm-server-initiated-edits' and brings about a new
confirmation model for code actions, making it possible to have only
certain commands require user confirmation.  It allows a temporary
'diff-mode' buffer to display the proposed changes, so the user can
apply them one by one.  See bug#60338.

** Completion sorting has been fixed

In some situations, Eglot was not respecting the completion sort order
decided by the language server, falling back on the sort order
determined by the 'flex' completion style instead.  See github#1306.

** Improve mouse invocation of code actions

When invoking code actions by middle clicking with the mouse on
Flymake diagnostics, it was often the case that Eglot didn't request
code actions correctly and thus no actions were offered to the user.
This has been fixed.  See github#1295.

** Optimized file-watching capability

Some servers, like the Pyright language server, issue too many file
watching requests.  This change slightly reduces the number of file
watcher objects requested from the operating system, which can be a
problem, particularly on Mac OS.  See github#1228 and github#1226.

** Faster, more accurate, event logging

The Eglot events buffer takes advantage of new functionality in
Jsonrpc 1.23.  By default, Lisp-style printing of JSON-RPC message (a
common cause of performance degradation) is disabled.  The full
original JSON message is presented instead.  See new variable
'eglot-events-buffer-config', which replaces the obsolete
'eglot-events-buffer-size'.

** 'textdocument/onTypeFormatting' feature has been fixed

For 'newline' commands, Eglot sometimes sent the wrong character code
to the server.  Also this feature is now less chatty in the mode-line
and messages buffer.

** Partial fix C-M-i "middle-of-symbol" completions (github#1339)

** Add "Extending Eglot" section to manual

** Fixed Elisp interface 'eglot-lsp-context' (github#1336, github#1337)

** Supports LSP's 'window/showRequest' (bug#62116)

** The self-upgrade command is now called 'eglot-upgrade-eglot'

** Newly added directories also watched (github#1228)

** Send correct ':language-id' for JavaScript server (bug#67150)

** New servers have been added to 'eglot-server-programs'.

- nls (bug#63603)
- nixd (bug#64214)
- lexical (bug#65359)
- terraform-ls (bug#65671)
- ruff-lsp (bug#67441)
- uiua (bug#67850)


* Changes in Eglot 1.15 (29/4/2023)

** Fix LSP "languageId" detection

Many servers today support multiple languages, meaning they can handle
more than one file type in the same connection.  This relies on the
client supplying a ':languageId' string.  Previously, Eglot calculated
this string based on an imperfect heuristic and was often wrong.  See
github#1206.

** Fix problems with missing signature documentation (bug#62687)

** Reworked 'eglot-imenu'

Eglot's Imenu backend (used for M-x imenu among other extensions), has
been reworked.  Most newer servers respond to
'textDocument/documentSymbol' with a vector of 'DocumentSymbol', not
'SymbolInformation'.  It's not worth it trying to make the two formats
resemble each other.  This also lays groundwork supporting a
forthcoming "breadcrumb" feature of bug#58431.

** New command 'eglot-update'

This allows users to easily update to the latest version of Eglot.


* Changes in Eglot 1.14 (3/4/2023)

** Faster, more responsive completion

Eglot takes advantage of LSP's "isIncomplete" flag in responses to
completion requests to drive new completion-caching mechanism for the
duration of each completion session.  Once a full set of completions
is obtained for a given position, the server needn't be contacted in
many scenarios, resulting in significantly less communication
overhead.  This works with the popular Company package and stock
completion-at-point interfaces.

A variable 'eglot-cache-session-completions', t by default, controls
this.  The mechanism was tested with ccls, jdtls, pylsp, golsp and
clangd.  Notably, the C/C++ language server Clangd version 15 has a
bug in its "isIcomplete" flag (it is fixed in later versions).  If you
run into problems, disable this mechanism like so:

(add-hook 'c-common-mode-hook
   (lambda () (setq-local eglot-cache-session-completions nil)))

** At-point documentation less obtrusive in echo area

Eglot takes advantage of new features of ElDoc to separate short
documentation strings from large ones, sending the former to be shown in
the ElDoc's echo area and the latter to be shown in other outlets,
such as the *eldoc* buffer obtainable with 'C-h .'.

** New variable 'eglot-prefer-plaintext'

Customize this to t to opt-in to docstrings in plain text instead of
Markdown.

(bug#61373)

** Progress indicators inhabit the mode-line by default

To switch to the echo area, customize 'eglot-report-progress' to
'messages'.  To switch off progress reporting completely, set to nil.

** Snippet support is easier to enable

The user needn't manually activate 'yas-minor-mode' or
'yas-global-mode'.  If YASnippet is installed and the server supports
snippets, it is used automatically, unless the symbol 'yasnippet' has
been added to 'eglot-stay-out-of'.


* Changes in Eglot 1.13 (15/03/2023)

** ELPA installations on Emacs 26.3 are supported again.


* Changes in Eglot 1.12.29 (Eglot bundled with Emacs 29.1)

** Eglot has a new command to upgrade to the latest version.

The new command 'eglot-upgrade-eglot' allows easily grabbing the
latest version of Eglot from ELPA.  This might be more convenient than
using the more general command 'package-install', which by default
will not upgrade "built-in" packages, those that come with Emacs.


* Changes in Eglot 1.12 (13/03/2023)

** LSP inlay hints are now supported.
Inlay hints are small text annotations not unlike diagnostics, but
designed to help readability instead of indicating problems.  For
example, a C++ LSP server can serve hints about positional parameter
names in function calls and a variable's automatically deduced type.
Emacs can display these hints using overlays, helping the user
remember those types and parameter names.

** Longstanding Tramp instability issues solved.
The solution involves a Tramp-specific workaround in Eglot.  Future
Tramp versions will have this problem solved at the origin.  The
workaround will then be removed.  Emacs bug#61350 has more details.

(github#859, github#1020, github#883)

** LSP's 'positionEncoding' capability is now supported.
The position-encoding scheme (UTF-8, UTF-16 or UTF-32) can now
be negotiated with the server.

** More of the user's Eldoc configuration is respected.
This change addresses the problems reported in many Eglot reports
dating back to early 2021 at least.

(github#646, github#894, github#920, github#1031, github#1171).

This is unfinished work, as 'eldoc-documentation-strategy' is still
set by Eglot during its tenure over a buffer.  The default value for
it cannot work reasonably with Eglot's additions to
'eldoc-documentation-functions'.

** Completion labels are correctly displayed in servers like clangd.

(github#1141)

** Assorted bugfixes.

(bug#61312, bug#61478, bug#61532, bug#61726, bug#61866, bug#61748)


* Changes in Eglot 1.11 (27/1/2023)

** New server vscode-json-languageserver added to 'eglot-server-programs'.

(bug#60198)

** Assorted bugfixes.

(bug#60379, bug#60557, (bug#61048)


* Changes in Eglot 1.10 (16/12/2022)

** Emacs progress reporters are used for LSP progress notifications.
(bug#59149)

** LSP reported URIs other than file:// are passed on to Emacs.
This change allows other URI handlers, such as a 'jar:' handling
package, to cooperate with Eglot and find files inside compressed file
systems (bug#58790).

** Eglot now shows in the menu bar.

** Tree-sitter modes added to 'eglot-server-programs'.
These modes are usually handled by the same server that handles the
"classical mode".

** New servers csharp-ls and texlab added to 'eglot-server-programs'.

** Assorted bugfixes.
(bug#59824, bug#59338)


* Changes in Eglot 1.9 (8/10/2022)

This is the last release before integration into Emacs's core.

** New 'M-x eglot-list-connections' command.
Probably not very useful for now.  More keybindings and clickable
shortcuts to connection-specific commands to be added later.

** Manual temporarily lives in separate MANUAL.md file.
The manual has been rewritten mostly from scratch.  It is structured
hierarchically and is more complete.  After the merge into Emacs, the
Eglot Texinfo manual bundled with Emacs used this temporary manual as
a starting point.

** Support for "single server, multiple modes".
Previously, if an entry such as '((c++-mode c-mode) . ("clangd)")' was
found in 'eglot-server-programs', it meant that '.cpp' files '.c'
files would lead to two 'clangd' instances for managing them, even if
these files were in the same project.  Now only one is created.  It is
assumed that most, if not all, servers configured in
'eglot-server-programs' handle this correctly.

(github#681)

** 'eglot-imenu' no longer uses problematic "special elements".
Though Eglot's 'eglot-imenu' returned a fully compliant 'imenu'
structure, that object was not understood by many other frontends
other than 'M-x imenu' itself.  Since the special functionality it
enabled wasn't being used anyway, it was decided to remove it to fix
these longstanding problems.

(github#758, github#536, github#535)

** 'eglot-workspace-configuration' has been overhauled.
This variable and its uses are now more thoroughly documented.  It can
be set to a function for dynamic calculation of the configuration.
The preferred format is a plist, though the earlier alist format is
still supported.

(github#967, github#590, github#790)

** 'C-u M-.' lists and completes arbitrary workspace symbols.
A very old request, now made possible by a relatively recent change to
the 'workspace/symbol' RPC method.

(github#131)

** Reworked mode-line menus.
New menus help discover Eglot's features and show which of them are
supported by the current server.  Menus can be customized away via
'eglot-menu-string', making space in mode-line.

(github#792)

** Easier to use LSP 'initialize.initializationOptions'.
In 'eglot-server-programs' a plist may be appended to the usual list
of strings passed as command line arguments.  The value of its
':initializationOptions' key constructs the corresponding LSP JSON
object.  This may be easier than creating a 'defclass' for a specific
server and specializing 'eglot-initialization-options' to that class.

(github#901, github#845, github#940)

** LSP on-type formatting is now supported.
This is the 'documentOnTypeFormattingProvider' LSP capability, which
may be disabled via 'eglot-ignored-server-capabilities'

(github#899)

** Basic LSP "workspace folders" support added.
Eglot now advertises 'project-root' and 'project-external-roots' as
workspace-folders.  (Configuring 'project-vc-external-roots-function'
via Elisp or 'tags-table-list' via Customize are two ways to set the
external roots of a simple git project.)

(github#893)

** Eglot can now show project wide diagnostics via Flymake.
Some LSP servers report diagnostics for all files in the current
workspace.  Flymake has (as of version 1.2.1) the option to show
diagnostics from buffers other than the currently visited one.  The
command 'M-x flymake-show-project-diagnostics' will now show all the
diagnostics relevant to a workspace.

(github#810)

** Support LSP completion tags.
An LSP completion tag can be used to tell the editor how to render a
completion.  Presently, one kind of tag exists, denoting its
corresponding completion as obsolete.

(github#797)

** Support LSP optional diagnostic tags.
A diagnostic tag can indicate either "unused or unnecessary code" or
"deprecated or obsolete code".  Following the rendering suggestions in
the protocol, we fade out unnecessary code and strike-through
deprecated code.

(github#794)

** The Rust language server is now rust-analyzer by default.
Eglot will now prefer starting "rust-analyzer" to "rls" when it is
available.  The special support code for RLS has been removed.

(github#803)

** New servers have been added to 'eglot-server-programs'.
- clojure-lsp (github#813)
- racket-langserver (github#694)
- futhark lsp (github#922)
- purescript-language-server (github#905)
- Perl::LanguageServer (github#952)
- marksman (github#1013)
- jedi-language-server ([#994](github#994))


* Changes in Eglot 1.8 (12/1/2022)

** Alternate servers supported out-of-box for the same major mode.
In practice, this removes the need for Eglot to "officially" bless one
server over another.

Do not confuse this feature with another missing feature which
consists of supporting multiple servers simultaneously managing a
major mode within a project.

(github#688)

** TRAMP support added.
There are no variables to customize: visit a remote file, ensure the
server also exists in the remote, and type "M-x eglot".

(github#637, github#463, github#84)

** 'eglot-ignored-server-capabilities' is now correctly spelled.
This user-visible variable used to be spelled
'eglot-ignored-server-capabilites', which is still a valid but
obsolete name.

(github#724)

** Eglot can manage cross-referenced files outside project.
This is activated by a new customization option
'eglot-extend-to-xref', which defaults to nil.

(github#76, github#686, github#695)

** Code action shortcuts can be added by the user.
'M-x eglot-code-actions' accepts an optional 'action-kind' argument,
specified interactively with 'C-u'.  Other shortcuts call specific
actions directly ('eglot-code-action-inline',
'eglot-code-action-extract', 'eglot-code-action-rewrite',
'eglot-code-action-organize-imports' and
'eglot-code-action-quickfix').  One can create one's own shortcuts for
code actions with specific a kind by calling 'eglot-code-actions' from
Lisp.

(github#411)

** New command 'eglot-shutdown-all added.
This disconnects all the Eglot connections in the user's session.

(github#643)

** New variable 'eglot-withhold-process-id' added.
If non-nil, Eglot will not send the Emacs process ID to the language
server.  This can be useful when using docker to run a language
server.

(github#722)

** Several new servers have been added to 'eglot-server-programs'.
- cmake-language-server (github#787)
- css-languageserver (github#204, github#769)
- fortls (github#603)
- html-languageserver (github#204, github#769)
- json-languageserver (github#204, github#769)
- lua-lsp (github#721)
- mint ls (github#750)
- pyright (github#742)
- vim-language-server (github#787)
- yaml-language-server (github#751)
- zls (github#646)


* Changes in Eglot 1.7 (16/12/2020)

** Hierarchical symbols are supported in Imenu.
(github#303).

** Multiple "documentation at point" sources are supported.
Such sources include as LSP's signature, hover and also the Flymake
diagnostic messages.  They can all be presented in the echo area
(space permitting), or via 'C-h .'.  For now, composition of different
sources can be customized using 'eldoc-documentation-strategy',
'eldoc-echo-area-use-multiline-p' and 'eldoc-prefer-doc-buffer'.

The variables 'eglot-put-doc-in-help-buffer' and
'eglot-auto-display-help-buffer' have been removed.

(github#439, github#494, github#481, github#454)


* Changes in Eglot 1.6 (16/04/2020)

** Column offset calculation is now LSP-conformant.
It seems the majority of servers now comply with the language server
specification when it comes to handling non-ASCII texts.  Therefore
the default values of 'eglot-move-to-column-function' and
'eglot-current-column-function' have been changed.  Consult the
documentation of these variables for how to restore the old behavior.

(github#361)

** LSP workspace/configuration requests are supported.
Also a new section "Per-project server configuration" in the README.md
should answer some FAQ's in this regard.

(github#326)


* Changes in Eglot 1.5 (20/10/2019)

** Eglot takes over Company configuration.
Similar to what was already the case with Flymake, Eldoc and Xref, use
just the backend that can do something useful in Eglot,
'company-capf'.  See 'eglot-stay-out-of' to opt out of this.

(github#324)

** New option 'eglot-autoshutdown' added.
This disconnects the server after last managed buffer is killed.

(github#217, github#270)

** Completion support has been fixed.
Among other things, consider LSP's "filterText" cookies, which enable
a kind of poor-man's flex-matching for some backends.

(github#235, github#313, github#311, github#279)

** Supports LSP's "goto declaration/implementation/typeDefinition".

(github#302)

** New option 'eglot-send-changes-idle-time' added.

(github#258)

** Eglot's Eldoc no longer flickers when moving around.

(github#198)

** Large docs shown in help buffer instead of echo area by default.
Also add two new customization variables
'eglot-put-doc-in-help-buffer' and 'eglot-auto-display-help-buffer'.

(github#198)

** Built-in support for Go, Elixir and Ada added.

(github#304, github#264, github#316)


* Changes in Eglot 1.4 (5/1/2019)

** Parameter highlighting in the first line of signature corrected.

** Markdown documentation strings are rendered with faces.
Eglot uses 'gfm-view-mode' for this.

** Hard dependencies on Flymake have been removed.
The user can turn Flymake off now in buffers managed by Eglot.

** Connection hooks are run with proper directory local variables.
This fixes issues with suspiciously empty 'didChangeConfiguration'
messages that are supposed to communicate parameters from a
directory-set 'eglot-workspace-configuration'.

(github#196)

** Completion sorting has been fixed.
If the server returns completions in some sensible order, Eglot will
keep it.

(github#190)

** Flymake and Eldoc taken over completely while managing buffers.
No longer try to add Eglot's facilities to existing facilities in
these two domains.


* Changes in Eglot 1.3 (10/12/2018)

** Provide strict checking of incoming LSP messages.

(github#144, github#156)

** Add brief context after 'xref-find-references' when available.

(github#52)

** Support 'completionContext' to help servers like 'ccls'.

** Use Flymake from GNU ELPA.

(github#178)


* Changes in Eglot 1.2 (23/11/2018)

** Support snippet completions.
Eglot uses 'yasnippet.el' for this, if it is installed.

(github#50)

** 'workspace/didChangeConfiguration' implemented.

(github#29)

** Handle experimental/unknown server methods gracefully.

(github#39)

** Accept functions as entries in 'eglot-server-programs'.
'CONTACT' in the '(MAJOR-MODE . CONTACT)' association in
'eglot-server-programs' can now be a function of no arguments
producing any value previously valid for a contact.  Functions can be
interactive or non-interactive.

(github#63)

** Improve completion to be snappier and don't hinder typing.

(github#61)

** Consider ':triggerCharacters' in company completion.

(github#80)

** Add support for LSP 'TextEdit' objects in completion.

** Prefer ccls over cquery for C/C++

(github#94)

** 'eglot-ignored-server-capabilites' is more user-friendly.

(github#126)

** Supports asynchronous connections.
If a connection to the server is taking too long, is will continue in
the background.  A new defcustom 'eglot-sync-connect' controls this
feature.

(github#68)

** The 'eglot-shutdown' command prompts for the server to shutdown.

(github#73)

** Add support for the Eclipse JDT language server.

(github#63)

** Add out-of-the-box support for Haskell, Kotlin, Go, Ocaml, R.

** Add the ability to move to LSP-precise columns.
Some servers like 'clangd' follow the UTF-16-based spec very closely
here.

(github#124)

** Fix a potential security issue fontifying LSP doc.

(github#154)

** Fix many, many bugs

(github#44, github#48, github#54, github#58, github#64, github#74,
 github#81, github#82, github#86, github#87, github#83, github#93,
 github#100, github#115, github#120, github#121, github#126,
 github#138, github#144, github#158, github#160, github#167)


* Changes in Eglot 1.1 (9/7/2018)

** Implement TCP autostart/autoconnect (and support Ruby's Solargraph).
The ':autoport' symbol in the server invocation is replaced
dynamically by a local port believed to be vacant, so that the ensuing
TCP connection finds a listening server.

** Eglot now depends on Emacs library 'jsonrpc.el'.
