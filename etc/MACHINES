This is a list of the status of GNU Emacs on various machines and systems.

Information about older releases, and platforms that are no longer
supported, has been removed.  Consult older versions of this file if
you are interested in this information.

The 'configure' script uses the configuration name, and the results of
testing the system, to decide which options to use in src/config.h and
elsewhere (eg Makefiles).

If you add support for a new configuration, add a section to this
file, and edit the 'configure.ac' source as needed.

Some obsolete platforms are unsupported beginning with Emacs 23.1.  See
the list at the end of this file.


* Here are notes about some of the systems supported:

** GNU/Linux

  Most of the complete systems which use the Linux kernel are close
  enough to the GNU system to be considered variant GNU systems.  We
  call them "Linux-based GNU systems," or GNU/Linux for short.

  It is not coincidence that many of the other components used with
  Linux--including GNU Emacs--were developed specifically for the GNU
  project.  The GNU project was launched in 1984 to develop a free
  complete Unix-like operating system.  To reach this goal, we had to
  develop whatever system components were not available as freely
  redistributable software from some other source.

  The GNU project wants users of GNU/Linux systems to be aware of how
  these systems relate to the GNU project, because that will help
  spread the GNU idea that software should be free--and thus encourage
  people to write more free software.  For more information, see
  <https://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html>.

*** 64-bit GNU/Linux

  No special procedures should be needed to build a 64-bit Emacs on a
  64-bit GNU/Linux system.  To build a 32-bit Emacs, first ensure that
  the necessary 32-bit system libraries and include files are
  installed.  Then use:

    ./configure CC='gcc -m32' --build=i386-linux-gnu \
      --x-libraries=/usr/X11R6/lib

  (using the location of the 32-bit X libraries on your system).

*** IBM System/390 running GNU/Linux (s390-*-linux-gnu)

  As of Emacs 21.2, a 31-bit only version is supported on this system.

*** SuperH (sh[34]*-*-linux-gnu)

  Emacs 23.0.60 was reported to work on GNU/Linux (October 2008).
  This was tested on a little-endian sh4 system (cpu type SH7751R) running
  Gentoo Linux 2008.0.

** macOS

  Mac OS X 10.6 or newer.  PowerPC is not supported.
  For installation instructions see the file nextstep/INSTALL.

** Microsoft Windows

  For installation instructions see the file nt/INSTALL.

** MS-DOS

  For installation instructions see the file msdos/INSTALL.
  See the "MS-DOS" chapter of the manual for information about using
  Emacs on MS-DOS.

** Solaris

  On Solaris it is also possible to use either GCC or Oracle Developer
  Studio to build Emacs, by pointing ./configure to the right compiler:

    ./configure                # Defaults to 'gcc' if available.
    ./configure CC='cc'        # Oracle Developer Studio

  On Solaris, do not use /usr/ucb/cc.  Use Oracle Developer Studio.
  Make sure that /usr/ccs/bin and the Oracle Developer Studio bin
  directory (e.g., /opt/developerstudio12.6/bin) are in your PATH
  before /usr/ucb.  (Most free software packages have the same
  requirement on Solaris.)  With this compiler, use 'cc -E' as the
  preprocessor.  If this inserts extra whitespace into its output (see
  the PROBLEMS file), add the option '-Xs'.

  To build a 64-bit Emacs (with larger maximum buffer size) on a
  Solaris system that defaults to 32-bit executables, specify the -m64
  compiler option.  For example:

    ./configure CC='gcc -m64'  # GCC
    ./configure CC='cc -m64'   # Oracle Developer Studio


* Obsolete platforms

Support for many obsolete platforms was removed in Emacs 23.1.
If for some reason you encounter an ancient machine where current
Emacs does not compile, try an older release like Emacs 22.3.
