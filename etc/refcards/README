REFERENCE CARDS FOR GNU EMACS

To generate these refcards, you need to install the TeX document
production system.  For example, <http://www.tug.org/texlive/>.

All modern GNU/Linux distributions provide TeX packages, so the
easiest way is just to install those.  Your distribution may have
split some of the files needed to process non-English output into
separate, optional packages such as: texlive-lang-cyrillic,
texlive-lang-czechslovak, texlive-lang-german, and texlive-lang-polish.

Type 'make all' (or 'make pdf') to generate PDF versions of all the cards.
For PostScript format, use 'make ps'.
To only generate the cards for a specific language, use e.g.
'make french' or 'make french-ps'.  As mentioned above, you may need
to install extra TeX packages for some languages.

PDF and PS copies of these cards are also available at
<https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/refcards>.  The FSF online
store <https://shop.fsf.org/> sometimes has printed copies for sale.
