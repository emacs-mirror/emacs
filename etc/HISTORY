	GNU Emacs history, versions, and release dates

For more details about release contents, see the NEWS* files.

Most of the development history of GNU Emacs is available in its
source code repository <https://savannah.gnu.org/git/?group=emacs>.
However, in the early days GNU Emacs was developed without using
version control systems and was published via half-inch 9-track
1600-bpi magnetic tape reels.  Although information about this early
development is sketchy, the following text summarizes what is known.

EMACS started out as a set of macros atop the TECO text editor, and
was first operational in late 1976.  It was inspired by earlier work
such as the E editor of Stanford, and was based on older TECO macro
sets.  See: Stallman RM. EMACS: The Extensible, Customizable
Self-Documenting Display Editor.  AI Memo 519a, MIT, 1981-03-26
<http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/5736/AIM-519A.pdf>.
EMACS in turn inspired several similar editors.  For a summary of
this history, see <https://github.com/larsbrinkhoff/emacs-history>.

In 1984, work began on GNU Emacs, a fresh implementation designed to
run on GNU and GNU-like systems, with a full-featured Lisp at its
core.  GNU Emacs 1.0 through 1.12 were released in early 1985.  The
next version after 1.12 was 13; this was the initial public release.

Here is a list of known GNU Emacs stable releases starting with the
initial public release.  Entries in the list are of the form "GNU
Emacs N (DATE) TAG", where N is the version number, DATE the release
date, and TAG (if present) the corresponding tag in the source code
repository.  Any commentary about the version starts on the next line.
Dates are approximate in the following list; some are when the version
was made, some are when it was announced.
