Please read the entirety of this file before attempting to build Emacs
as an application package which can run on Android devices.

When building from the source repository (as opposed to from a release
tarball), make sure to read INSTALL.REPO in the top-level directory as
well.



Android is an unusual operating system in that program binaries cannot
be produced on computers running Android themselves.  Instead, they
must be built on some other computer using a set of tools known as the
``Android SDK'' (Software Development Kit) and the ``Android NDK''
(Native Development Kit.)  Appropriate versions of both must be
obtained to build GNU Emacs; after being built, the generated binaries
will work on almost all Android devices.  This document does not
elaborate on how both sets of tools can be obtained.  However, for
your freedom's sake, you should use the Android SDK provided by the
Debian project.

In addition to the Android SDK and Android NDK, Emacs also requires
the Java compiler from OpenJDK 1.7.0 to be installed on your system,
along with a working `m4' macro processor.  Building on GNU systems is
all that is officially supported.  We are told that Mac OS works too,
and other Unix systems will likely work as well, but MS Windows and
Cygwin will not.

Once all of those tools are obtained, you may invoke the `configure'
script like so:

  ./configure --with-android=/path/to/android.jar \
	      ANDROID_CC=/path/to/android/ndk/cc  \
	      SDK_BUILD_TOOLS=/path/to/sdk/build/tools

Replacing the paths in the command line above with:

  - the path to the `android.jar' headers which come with the Android
    SDK.  They must correspond to Android version 16 (API level 36).

  - the path to the C compiler in the Android NDK, for the kind of CPU
    you are building Emacs to run on.

  - the path to the directory in the Android SDK containing binaries
    such as `aapt', `apksigner', and `d8'.  These are used to build
    the application package.

Where the type of CPU can either be `aarch64', `armeabi', `armv7*',
`i686', `x86_64', `mips', or `mips64'.

After the configuration process completes, you may run:

  make all

Once `make' finishes, there should be a file in the `java' directory
named along the lines of:

  emacs-<version>-<api-version>-<abi>.apk

where <api-version> is the oldest version of Android that the package
will run on, and <abi> is the type of Android machine the package was
built for.

The generated package can be uploaded onto an SD card (or similar
medium) and installed on-device.


LOCATING NECESSARY FILES

As illustrated above, building Emacs for Android requires the presence
three separate components of the Android SDK and NDK.  Subsequent to
their installation, the contents of the Android development tools are
organized into several directories, of which those pertinent to the
Emacs compilation process are:

  platforms
  ndk
  build-tools

The platforms directory contains one subdirectory for each API level
whose headers have been installed.  Each of these directories in turn
includes the android.jar archive for that version of Android, also
necessary for compiling Emacs.

It is imperative that Emacs is compiled using the headers for the
exact API level that it is written for.  This is currently API level
35, so the correct android.jar archive is located within a directory
whose name begins with `android-35'.  Minor revisions to the headers
are inconsequential towards the Emacs compilation process; if there is
a directory named `android-35-extN' (where N represents a revision to
the Android SDK), whether you provide `configure' with that
directory's android.jar or the android.jar contained within the
directory named `android-35' is of no special importance.

The ndk directory contains one subdirectory for each version of the
Android NDK installed.  This directory in turn contains the C and C++
compilation system.  In contrast to the Java headers mentioned within
the previous paragraph, the version of the NDK used does not affect
Emacs to the extent the version of android.jar does.  Having said
that, each version of the NDK only supports a limited range of API
levels; your choice of C compiler binary (or __ANDROID_API__) bears
upon the earliest version of Android the compiled package will
support.

In most cases, each subdirectory contains a folder named `toolchains',
holding an `llvm' directory and one directory for each GCC toolchain
supplied by the NDK.  The C compiler is then positioned within
`prebuilt/*/bin' inside that directory.

The build-tools directory holds subdirectories containing the utility
programs used to convert class files output by the Java compiler to the
DEX format employed by Android.  There is one subdirectory for each
version of the build tools, but the version you opt for is not of
paramount significance: if your version does not work, configure will
protest, so install a newer one.  We anticipate that most recent
releases will work, such as those from the 35.0.x and 36.0.x series.


BUILDING WITH OLD NDK VERSIONS

Building Emacs with an old version of the Android NDK requires special
setup.	This is because there is no separate C compiler binary for
each version of Android in those versions of the NDK.

Before running `configure', you must identify three variables:

  - What kind of Android system you are building Emacs for.

  - The minimum API version of Android you want to build Emacs for.

  - The locations of the system root and include files for that
    version of Android in the NDK.

That information must then be specified as arguments to the NDK C
compiler.  For example:

  ./configure [...] \
     ANDROID_CC="i686-linux-android-gcc \
		 --sysroot=/path/to/ndk/platforms/android-14/arch-x86/
		 -isystem /path/to/ndk/sysroot/usr/include \
		 -isystem /path/to/ndk/sysroot/usr/include/i686-linux-android \
		 -D__ANDROID_API__=14"

Where __ANDROID_API__ and the version identifier in
"platforms/android-14" defines the version of Android you are building
for, and the include directories specify the paths to the relevant
Android headers.  In addition, it may be necessary to specify
"-gdwarf-2", due to a bug in the Android NDK.

Even older versions of the Android SDK do not require the extra
`-isystem' directives.

Emacs is known to run on Android 2.2 (API version 8) or later, with
the NDK r10b or later.  We wanted to make Emacs work on even older
versions of Android, but they are missing the required JNI graphics
library that allows Emacs to display text from C code.

There is an extremely nasty bug in the Android 2.2 system, the upshot of
which is that large files within the generated Emacs package cannot be
compressed in builds for Android 2.2, so that the Emacs package will be
approximately 15 megabytes larger than a compressed package for a newer
version of Android.  For such systems the `zip' utility is also required
to produce packages that will not be misinterpreted by the package
manager.


BUILDING C++ DEPENDENCIES

In normal circumstances, Emacs should automatically detect and configure
one of the C++ standard libraries part of the NDK when such a library is
required to build a dependency specified under `--with-ndk-path'.

Nevertheless, this process is not infallible, and with certain versions
of the NDK is liable to fail to locate a C++ compiler, requiring that
you run the `make_standalone_toolchain.py' script in the NDK
distribution to create a ``standalone toolchain'' and substitute the
same for the regular compiler toolchain.  See
https://developer.android.com/ndk/guides/standalone_toolchain for
further details.

Some versions of the NDK that ship GCC 4.9.x exhibit a bug where the
compiler cannot locate `stddef.h' after being copied to a standalone
toolchain.  To work around this problem, add:

   -isystem /path/to/toolchain/include/c++/4.9.x

to ANDROID_CFLAGS.


16 KB PAGE SIZES

New Android devices might be configured with kernels that only support
16 KB page sizes, rendering them liable not to run Emacs binaries, and
those of other programs, that are not properly compiled for such an
environment.  Ideally, `configure' will automatically detect toolchain
and compiler support for this configuration, and diagnose its absence by
a warning message, but Emacs cannot diagnose the mismatch if the NDK
toolchain supports 16 KB page sizes while the shared object implementing
the C++ standard library does not, and Emacs binaries generated by such
a combination will crash at startup on those devices.

As such, you are advised to build Emacs with the NDK r27 or better, if
producing binaries to run on aarch64 or x86_64 devices and Android 15 or
future releases.


DEBUG AND RELEASE BUILDS

Android makes a distinction between ``debug'' and ``release'' builds
of applications.  With ``release'' builds, the system will apply
stronger optimizations to the application at the cost of being unable
to debug them with the steps in etc/DEBUG.

Emacs is built as a debuggable package by default, but:

      ./configure --without-android-debug

will create a release build of Emacs instead.  This may be useful when
running Emacs on resource constrained machines.

If you are building an Emacs package for redistribution, we urge you
to provide both debug and release versions.


BUILDING WITH A SHARED USER ID

Sometimes it may be desirable to build Emacs so that it is able to
access executables and application data from another program.  To
achieve this, that other program must have a ``shared user ID'', and
be signed with the same signing key used to sign Emacs (normally
`emacs.keystore'.)

Once you have both that signing key and its ``shared user ID'', you
can give it to configure:

    ./configure --with-shared-user-id=MY.SHARED.USER.ID

For instance,

    ./configure --with-shared-user-id=com.termux

will result in Termux (https://termux.dev)'s application data being
accessible to Emacs, within its own application data directory located
at `/data/data/com.termux/files'.

Don't do this if you already have Emacs installed with a different
shared user ID, as the system does not allow programs to change their
user IDs after being installed.


BUILDING WITH THIRD PARTY LIBRARIES

The Android NDK does not support the usual ways of locating third
party libraries, especially not via `pkg-config'.  Instead, it uses
its own system called `ndk-build'.  The one exception to this rule is
zlib, which is considered a part of the Android OS itself and is
available on all devices running Android.

Android also requires that each application include its own
dependencies, as the system makes no guarantee about the existence of
any particular library.

Emacs is not built with the `ndk-build' system.	 Instead, it is built
with Autoconf and Make.

However, it supports building and including dependencies which use the
similarly Make-based `ndk-build' system.

To use dependencies built through `ndk-build', you must specify a list
of directories within which Emacs will search for ``Android.mk''
files, like so:

  ./configure "--with-ndk-path=directory1 directory2"

If `configure' complains about not being able to find
``libc++_shared.so'', then you must locate that file in your copy of
the NDK, and specify it like so:

  ./configure --with-ndk-cxx-shared=/path/to/sysroot/libc++_shared.so

Emacs will then read the ``Android.mk'' file in each directory, and
automatically build and use those modules.

When building for Intel systems, some ``ndk-build'' modules require
the Netwide Assembler, usually installed under ``nasm'', to be present
on the system that is building Emacs.

Google has adapted several Emacs dependencies to use the `ndk-build'
system, many of which require patches to function under an Emacs
environment.  As such, it is generally the wiser choice to use our ports
in their place, but the following list and patches are still provided
for reference.

  libpng	- https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/libpng
  giflib	- https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/giflib
     (You must add LOCAL_EXPORT_CFLAGS := -I$(LOCAL_PATH) before
      its Android.mk includes $(BUILD_STATIC_LIBRARY))
  libjpeg-turbo - https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/libjpeg-turbo
     (You must add LOCAL_EXPORT_C_INCLUDE_DIRS := $(LOCAL_PATH) before
      its Android.mk includes $(BUILD_SHARED_LIBRARY))
  libxml2	- https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/libxml2/
     (You must also place the dependency icu4c in ``--with-ndk-path'',
      and apply the patch at the end of this file.)
  icu4c		- https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/icu/
     (You must apply the patch at the end of this file.)
  sqlite3	- https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/sqlite/
     (You must apply the patch at the end of this file, and add the `dist'
      directory to ``--with-ndk-path''.)
  libselinux	- https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/libselinux
     (You must apply the patches at the end of the file, and obtain
      the following three dependencies.)
  libpackagelistparser
    https://android.googlesource.com/platform/system/core/+/refs/heads/nougat-mr1-dev/libpackagelistparser/
    (You must add LOCAL_EXPORT_C_INCLUDE_DIRS := $(LOCAL_PATH)/include before
      its Android.mk includes $(BUILD_SHARED_LIBRARY))
  libpcre	- https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/pcre
  libcrypto	- https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/boringssl
     (You must apply the patch at the end of this file when building for
      ARM systems.)

Many of these dependencies have been migrated over to the
``Android.bp'' build system now used to build Android itself.
However, the old ``Android.mk'' Makefiles are still present in older
branches, and can be easily adapted to newer versions.

In addition, some Emacs dependencies provide `ndk-build' support
themselves:

  libwebp	- https://android.googlesource.com/platform/external/webp
     (You must apply the patch at the end of this file for the resulting
      binary to work on armv7 devices.)

Emacs developers have ported the following dependencies to ARM Android
systems:

  gnutls, gmp	- https://sourceforge.net/projects/android-ports-for-gnu-emacs
    (Please see the section GNUTLS near the end of this file.)
  libtiff    	- https://sourceforge.net/projects/android-ports-for-gnu-emacs
    (Extract and point ``--with-ndk-path'' to tiff-4.5.0-emacs.tar.gz.)
  tree-sitter	- https://sourceforge.net/projects/android-ports-for-gnu-emacs
    (Please see the section TREE-SITTER near the end of this file.)
  harfbuzz  	- https://sourceforge.net/projects/android-ports-for-gnu-emacs
    (Please see the section HARFBUZZ near the end of this file.)
  libxml2       - https://sourceforge.net/projects/android-ports-for-gnu-emacs
    (Please see the section LIBXML2 near the end of this file.)
  libjpeg-turbo - https://sourceforge.net/projects/android-ports-for-gnu-emacs
  giflib        - https://sourceforge.net/projects/android-ports-for-gnu-emacs
  libtiff       - https://sourceforge.net/projects/android-ports-for-gnu-emacs
  libpng        - https://sourceforge.net/projects/android-ports-for-gnu-emacs
    (Please see the section IMAGE LIBRARIES near the end of this file.)
  libselinux - https://sourceforge.net/projects/android-ports-for-gnu-emacs
    (Please see the section SELINUX near the end of this file.)

And other developers have ported the following dependencies to Android
systems:

  ImageMagick, lcms2 - https://github.com/MolotovCherry/Android-ImageMagick7
    (Please see the section IMAGEMAGICK near the end of this file.)

We anticipate that most untested non-trivial ndk-build dependencies
will need adjustments in Emacs to work, as the Emacs build system
which emulates ndk-build is in an extremely early state.


GNUTLS

Modified copies of GnuTLS and its dependencies (such as libgmp,
libtasn1, p11-kit) which can be built with the ndk-build system can be
found at https://sourceforge.net/projects/android-ports-for-gnu-emacs.

They have only been tested on arm64 Android systems running Android
5.0 or later, and armv7l systems running Android 13 or later, so your
mileage may vary, especially if you are trying to build Emacs for
another kind of machine.

To build Emacs with GnuTLS, you must unpack each of the following tar
archives in that site:

  gmp-6.2.1-emacs.tgz
  gnutls-3.8.5-emacs.tar.gz
    (or gnutls-3.8.5-emacs-armv7a.tar.gz on 32-bit systems)
  libtasn1-4.19.0-emacs.tar.gz
  p11-kit-0.24.1-emacs.tar.gz
  nettle-3.8-emacs.tar.gz

and add the resulting folders to ``--with-ndk-path''.  Do not attempt to
build these packages separately by means of `configure' scripts or
Makefiles inside.


LIBXML2

A copy of libxml2 adapted for the same build system is provided under
the name:

  libxml2-2.12.4-emacs.tar.gz

In contrast to the version distributed by Google, internationalization
is disabled, which eliminates the dependency on icu4c (and by extension
a C++ compiler).


IMAGE LIBRARIES

ndk-build enabled versions of image libraries required by Emacs are also
provided as:

  giflib-5.2.1-emacs.tar.gz
  libjpeg-turbo-3.0.2-emacs.tar.gz
  libpng-1.6.41-emacs.tar.gz
  tiff-4.5.1-emacs.tar.gz

Of which all but libjpeg-turbo-3.0.2-emacs.tar.gz should compile on
every supported Android system and toolchain; where the latter does not
compile, i.e. old armeabi toolchains, Google's version is a suitable
substitute.

Of the three remaining image-related dependencies, libwebp provides
upstream support for ndk-build, ImageMagick has been ported by
interested third-party developers, and librsvg is addressed below.


LIBRSVG

Librsvg 2.40.21, the final release in the librsvg 2.40.x series, the
last to be implemented in C, is provided as:

  librsvg-2.40.21-emacs.tar.gz

and has been lightly edited for compatibility with environments where
Pango cannot provide fonts, with the obvious caveat that text cannot be
displayed with the resulting librsvg binary.  Among numerous
dependencies are PCRE, and:

  libiconv-1.17-emacs.tar.gz
  libffi-3.4.5-emacs.tar.gz
  pango-1.38.1-emacs.tar.gz
  glib-2.33.14-emacs.tar.gz
  libcroco-0.6.13-emacs.tar.gz
  pixman-0.38.4-emacs.tar.gz
  libxml2-2.12.4-emacs.tar.gz
  gdk-pixbuf-2.22.1-emacs.tar.gz
  giflib-5.2.1-emacs.tar.gz
  libjpeg-turbo-3.0.2-emacs.tar.gz
  libpng-1.6.41-emacs.tar.gz
  tiff-4.5.1-emacs.tar.gz
  cairo-1.16.0-emacs.tar.gz

which must be individually unpacked and their contents provided on the
command line, as with other dependencies.  They will introduce
approximately 8 MiB's worth of shared libraries into the finished
application package.  It is unlikely that later releases of librsvg will
ever be ported, as they have migrated to a different implementation
language.

No effort has been expended on providing the latest and greatest of
these dependencies either; rather, the versions chosen are often the
earliest versions required by their dependents, these being the smaller
of all available versions, and generally more straightforward to port.


SELINUX

The upstream version of libselinux is available as:

  libselinux-3.6-emacs.tar.gz

and compiles on toolchains configured for Android 4.3 and later, which
are the earliest Android releases to support SELinux.  Its principal
advantage over Google's edition is the absence of Android-specific
modifications that create dependencies on libpackagelistparser and
libcrypto; Google's pcre remains a requirement.


TREE-SITTER

A copy of tree-sitter modified to build with the ndk-build system can
also be found that URL.  To build Emacs with tree-sitter, you must
unpack the following tar archive in that site:

  tree-sitter-0.20.7-emacs.tar.gz

and add the resulting folder to ``--with-ndk-build''.


HARFBUZZ

A copy of HarfBuzz modified to build with the ndk-build system can
also be found at that URL.  To build Emacs with HarfBuzz, you must
unpack the following tar archive in that site:

  harfbuzz-7.1.0-emacs.tar.gz (when building for Android >4.3
  			       with 21.0.x or later of the NDK)
  harfbuzz-1.7.7.tar.gz	      (earlier NDK or platform releases)

and add the resulting folder to ``--with-ndk-build''.


IMAGEMAGICK

There is a third party port of ImageMagick to Android.  Unfortunately,
the port also uses its own patched versions of libpng, libjpeg,
libtiff and libwebp, which conflict with those used by Emacs.  Its
Makefiles were also written for MS Windows, so you must also apply the
patch at the end of this file.



PATCH FOR LIBXML2

This patch must be applied to the Android.mk in Google's version of
libxml2 before it can be built for Emacs.  In addition, you must also
revert the commit `edb5870767fed8712a9b77ef34097209b61ab2db'.
