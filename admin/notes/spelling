Re "behavior" vs "behaviour", etc.

- GNU Emacs originated in the US.

- If there is a choice between US vs UK spelling for a word
  for new text (code, docs), choose the US variant.

- It's probably (IMHO --ttn, 2017-10-13) not a high priority to
  change existing text; use your best judgment (ask if unsure).

- The admin/run-codespell script treats many non-US spellings as
  typos and fixes them.  It does not consider Lisp symbols.

- Consider renaming especially commands and user options for
  consistency.  Leave obsolete aliases, as always.

- In comments, docstrings and other documentation that forms part of
  Emacs itself, prefer not to abbreviate "Emacs Lisp".
  In docstrings and the Texinfo manuals, say just "Lisp" whenever the
  context renders it unambiguous that you mean "Emacs Lisp".
  If you must abbreviate "Emacs Lisp", capitalize it thus: "Elisp".

- To indicate possession, write Emacs's rather than Emacs'.
