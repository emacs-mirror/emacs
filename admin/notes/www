NOTES FOR EMACS WWW PAGES

* Renaming pages, redirects

Sometimes you want to move a page to a new location.
If the old location might be referenced somewhere else, you should add
some form of redirect to the new location.  There are several ways to
do this:

** Use a refresh directive in the old file
https://www.gnu.org/server/standards/README.webmastering.html#htaccess

Change the entire contents of the old file to be something like:

<meta http-equiv="refresh" content="0; url=/software/emacs/manual/elisp.html">

I can't think of any reason to use this method.

** Use a .symlinks file
https://www.gnu.org/server/standards/README.webmastering.html#symlinks

This is really an interface to mod_rewrite rules, but it acts like
symlinks.  Remove old-page.html altogether, and create a ".symlinks"
file in the relevant directory, with contents of the form:

  # This is a comment line.
  old-page.html new-page.html

Anyone visiting old-page.html will be shown the contents of new-page.html.
Note that changes to .symlinks file are only updated periodically on
the server via cron (twice an hour?).  So there will be a delay (of up
to 30 minutes?) before you see your changes take effect.

This method is ok, but:
i) a person visiting old-page.html has no idea that the page has moved.
They still see old-page.html in their address bar.  (In other words,
the mod_rewrite rule does not use the [R] flag.)  Sometimes this is
what you want, sometimes not.

ii) it doesn't work right if the new page is in a different directory
to the old page: relative links from the visited page will break.

** Use a .htaccess file

Remove old-page.html altogether, and create a ".htaccess" file in the
relevant directory, with contents of the form:

  # This is a comment line.
  Redirect 301 /software/emacs/old-page.html /software/emacs/dir/new-page.html

Use "301" for a permanent redirection, otherwise you can omit the number.
Note that paths must (?) be relative to the top-level www.gnu.org.

I think this is the best method.  You can specify temporary or
permanent redirects, and changes go live more-or-less straight away.

This method is useful for making cross-references to non-Emacs manuals
work; see manual/.htaccess in the repository.  You only have to add a
single redirect for every given external manual, you can redirect
html_node to hmtl_node and html_mono to html_mono.
