To build the language definition for a particular language, run

    ./build.sh <language>

eg,

    ./build.sh html

The dynamic module will be in /dist directory

To build all modules at once, run

    ./batch.sh

This gives you C, JSON, Go, HTML, Javascript, CSS, Python, Typescript
(tsx), C# (csharp), C++ (cpp), Rust. More can be added to batch.sh
unless it's directory structure is not standard.
