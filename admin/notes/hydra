NOTES FOR EMACS CONTINUOUS BUILD ON HYDRA

A continuous build for Emacs can be found at
http://hydra.nixos.org/jobset/gnu/emacs-trunk
http://hydra.nixos.org/jobset/gnu/emacs-24

* It builds Emacs on various platforms.
Sometimes jobs fail due to hydra problems rather than Emacs problems.
Eg it seems like the cygwin build will never work again.

* Mail notifications
In addition to the web interface, Hydra can send notifications by
email when the build status of a project changes, e.g., from
SUCCEEDED to FAILED.  It sends notifications about build status in
Emacs trunk to emacs-buildstatus@gnu.org.

If you want to receive these notifications, please subscribe at
http://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/emacs-buildstatus

* The Emacs jobset consists of the following jobs:

** The 'tarball' job
which gets a checkout from the repository, and does a bootstrap followed
by running make-dist to create a tarball.  If this job fails, all the
others will too (because they use the tarball as input).

** The 'build' job
which starts from the tarball and does a normal build

** The 'coverage' job
does a gcov build and then runs 'make check'.  Fails if any test fails.

* Nix expressions
The recipe for GNU Emacs are available via Git:
http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/hydra-recipes.git/tree/emacs

To modify the build job, email the patch to hydra-users@gnu.org.  The
build recipes are written in the Nix language.

* Other Information
For a list of other GNU packages that have a continuous build on
Hydra, see http://hydra.nixos.org/project/gnu

See http://www.gnu.org/software/devel.html#Hydra for more information.
