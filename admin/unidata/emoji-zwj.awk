### Commentary:

## This script takes as input Unicode's emoji-zwj-sequences.txt
## and produces output for Emacs's lisp/international/emoji-zwj.el.
## It also outputs the composition sequences for flags, UK flags, and
## skin tones which have been derived from emoji-sequences.txt by hand.

## For additional details, see <https://debbugs.gnu.org/39799#8>.

## Things to do after installing a new version of
## emoji-zwj-sequences.txt and emoji-sequences.txt
## Check the output against the old output.  See if there are any new
## composition sequences in emoji-sequences.txt that that need to be
## added Rebuild emacs, visit emoji-zwj-sequences.txt and
## emoji-sequences.txt and check that the various sequences are being
## composed properly.  Don't forget to install an appropriate font,
## such as Noto Color Emoji.
