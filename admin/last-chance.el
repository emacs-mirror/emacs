;;; Commentary:

;; Late 2016.  In a recent build, the date in a ChangeLog file
;; is not fontified.  Turns out the face `change-log-date-face'
;; was declared obsolete since 22.1 and removed 2016-06-23.
;; (compile "git show c430f7e23fc2c22f251ace4254e37dea1452dfc3")
;;
;; This library provides a command `last-chance', which is a small
;; combination of "git grep" and some regexp filtering.  For example,
;; if point is on the symbol `change-log-date-face' in the form:
;;
;;  (define-obsolete-face-alias 'change-log-date-face ...)
;;
;; then:
;;
;;  M-x last-chance RET
;;
;; will show you any references to `change-log-date-face' in the
;; *.el files in a new buffer (in Grep mode).  Hopefully you see
;; only the obsolete declaration and can proceed w/ its removal.
;; If not, please DTRT and refrain from the removal until those
;; references are properly transitioned.
;;
;; [Insert "nobody reads ChangeLog files" lament, here.  --ttn]
