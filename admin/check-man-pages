### Commentary:

## Check Emacs man pages for errors using `man'.

### Code:

source "${0%/*}/emacs-shell-lib"

exit_status=0

cd "$PD"/../doc/man
for page in *.1; do
    # ctags.1 just includes the man page etags.1, which AFAICT will
    # default to the one installed on the system (!), instead of the
    # one in the repository.  So checking it is pointless, and we will
    # in any case already check etags.1 separately.
    if [ "$page" == "ctags.1" ]; then
        continue
    fi
    log=$(emacs_mktemp)
    LC_ALL=C.UTF-8 MANROFFSEQ='' MANWIDTH=80 \
        man --warnings=all,mac -E UTF-8 -l -Tutf8 -Z "$page" >/dev/null 2> "$log"
    log_size=$(stat --format=%s "$log")
    if [ "$log_size" -ne 0 ]; then
        echo "doc/man/$page:"
        # Point to the correct file for *compilation* buffers.
        cat "$log" \
            | sed 's/troff: man1\/\([^ ]\+\)\.1/troff: doc\/man\/\1.1/' \
            | sed "s/<standard input>/doc\/man\/$page/"
        exit_status=1
    fi
done

exit $exit_status
