Distribution Build Scripts for Windows
======================================

The scripts are used to build the binary distribution zip files for windows.

File System Organization
------------------------


They are relatively strict about the file system organization. In
general, they should work across several more than just the version of
Emacs they come with, as the dependencies of Emacs change relatively slowly.

The file system needs to be organized like so:

~/emacs-build/git

Contains a checkout of the Emacs git repository, organized according
to branches, with git worktree

~/emacs-build/git/emacs-$branch

A branch of the git repository containing the current release
branch. This has to be created by hand.

~/emacs-build/git/emacs-$version

A branch of the git repository containing the last release. The
build-zips.sh file will create this for you.

~/emacs-build/deps

A location for the dependencies. This needs to contain two zip files
with the dependencies. build-dep-zips.py will create these files for you.

~/emacs-build/deps/libXpm/i686
~/emacs-build/deps/libXpm/x86_64

Contain libXpm-noX4.dll. This file is used to load images for the
splash screen, menu items and so on. Emacs runs without it, but looks
horrible. The x86_64 comes from msys2, while the i686 comes from
ezwinports because it itself has no dependencies. These have to be
placed manually (but probably never need updating).


~/emacs-build/build/$version/i686
~/emacs-build/build/$version/x86_64

We build Emacs out-of-source here. This directory is created by
build-zips.sh. This directory can be freely deleted after zips have
been created


~/emacs-build/install/$version/i686
~/emacs-build/install/$version/x86_64

We install Emacs here. This directory is created by build-zips.sh.
This directory can and *should* be deleted after zips have been
created.

~/emacs-upload

Zips are created and moved here from where they can be, well,
uploaded.



Build Process
-------------

For each major version:

The dependencies files need to be created. This can be around the time
of the pre-tests, then used for all releases of that version, to
ensure the maximum stability.

To do this:

Update msys to the latest version with `pacman -Syu`.

Then run build-dep-zips.py, in this directory. Three zips will be
created, containing the 64bit and 32bit dependencies, as well as the
source for these.

For emacs release or pre-test version:

Run `build-zips.sh -g` in the release branch. This will create a worktree
with the tag of the last version.

Then run `build-zips.sh` in this worktree. Eventually, four new zip
files will be created in ~/emacs-upload from where they can be signed
and uploaded with `gnupload`.
