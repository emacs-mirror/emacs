/* Just like strftime, but with two more arguments:
   POSIX requires that strftime use the local timezone information.
   Use the timezone __TZ instead.  Use __NS as the number of
   nanoseconds in the %N directive.

   On error, set errno and return 0.  Otherwise, return the number of
   bytes generated (not counting the trailing NUL), preserving errno
   if the number is 0.  This errno behavior is in draft POSIX 202x
   plus some requested changes to POSIX.  */
