      /* realloc (NULL, 0) acts like glibc malloc (0), i.e., like malloc (1)
         except the caller cannot dereference any non-null return.

         realloc (P, 0) with non-null P is a messier situation.
         As mentioned above, C23 says behavior is undefined.
         POSIX.1-2024 extends C17 to say realloc (P, 0)
         either fails by setting errno and returning a null pointer,
         or succeeds by freeing P and then either:
           (a) setting errno=EINVAL and returning a null pointer; or
           (b) acting like a successful malloc (0).
         glibc 1 through 2.1 realloc acted like (b),
         which conforms to C17, to C23 and to POSIX.1-2024.
         glibc 2.1.1+ realloc acts like (a) except it does not set errno;
         this conforms to C17 and to C23 but not to POSIX.1-2024.
         Quite possibly future versions of POSIX will change,
         due either to C23 or to (a)'s semantics being messy.
         Act like (b), as that's easy, matches GNU, BSD and V7 malloc,
         matches BSD and V7 realloc, and requires no extra code at
         caller sites.  */
