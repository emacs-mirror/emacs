/* Windows are allocated as if they were vectors, but then the Lisp
data type is changed to Lisp_Window.  They are garbage collected along
with the vectors.

All windows in use are arranged into a tree, with pointers up and down.

Windows that are leaves of the tree are actually displayed and show
the contents of buffers.  Windows that are not leaves are used for
representing the way groups of leaf windows are arranged on the frame.
Leaf windows never become non-leaves.  They are deleted only by
calling `delete-window' on them (but this can be done implicitly).
Non-leaf windows never become leaf windows and can be created and
deleted at any time by the window management code.  Non-leaf windows
can be seen but not directly manipulated by Lisp functions.

A leaf window has a buffer stored in its contents field and markers in
its 'start' and 'pointm' fields.  Non-leaf windows have nil in the
latter two fields.  Non-leaf windows are either vertical or horizontal
combinations.

A vertical combination window has children that are arranged on the
frame one above the next.  Its 'contents' field points to the
uppermost child.  The 'parent' field of each of the children points to
the vertical combination window.  The 'next' field of each child
points to the child below it, or is nil for the lowest child.  The
'prev' field of each child points to the child above it, or is nil for
the highest child.

A horizontal combination window has children that are arranged side by
side.  Its 'contents' field points to the leftmost child.  In each
child the 'next' field points to the child to the right and the 'prev'
field points to the child to the left.

On each frame there are at least one and at most two windows which
have nil as parent.  The second of these, if present, is the frame's
minibuffer window and shows the minibuffer or the echo area.  The
first one manages the remaining frame area and is called the frame's
root window.  Different windows can be the root at different times;
initially the root window is a leaf window, but if more windows are
created, then that leaf window ceases to be root and a newly made
combination window becomes the root instead.

On frames which have an ordinary window and a minibuffer window,
'prev' of the minibuffer window is the root window and 'next' of the
root window is the minibuffer window.  On minibuffer-less frames there
is only a root window and 'next' of the root window is nil.  On
minibuffer-only frames, the root window and the minibuffer window are
one and the same, so its 'prev' and 'next' members are nil.  In any
case, 'prev' of a root window and 'next' of a minibuffer window are
always nil.

In Lisp parlance, leaf windows are called "live windows" and non-leaf
windows are called "internal windows".  Together, live and internal
windows form the set of "valid windows".  A window that has been
deleted is considered "dead" regardless of whether it formerly was a
leaf or a non-leaf window.  A dead window has its 'contents' field set
to nil.

Frames may also contain pseudo windows, windows that are not exposed
directly to Lisp code.  Pseudo windows are currently either used to
display the menu bar or the tool bar (when Emacs uses toolkits that
don't display their own menu bar and tool bar) or a tooltip in a
tooltip frame (when tooltips are not display by the toolkit).  */

       see below.  On a frame that is neither a minibuffer-only nor a
       minibuffer-less frame, 'next' of the root window points to the
       frame's minibuffer window and 'prev' of the minibuffer window
       points to the frame's root window.  In all other cases, 'next'
       of the root window and 'prev' of the minibuffer window, if
