This directory contains the source files for the C component of GNU Emacs.
Nothing in this directory is needed for using Emacs once it is built
and installed, if the dumped Emacs is copied elsewhere.

See the files ../README and then ../INSTALL for installation instructions.

The file 'Makefile.in' is used as a template by the script
'../configure' to produce 'Makefile'.  This is the file which actually
controls the compilation of Emacs C source files.  All of this should
work transparently; you should only need to change to the parent
directory, run './configure', and then run 'make'.
