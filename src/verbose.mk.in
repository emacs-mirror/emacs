# Whether $(info ...) works.  This is to work around a bug in GNU Make
# 4.3 and earlier, which implements $(info MSG) via two system calls
# { write (..., "MSG", 3); write (..., "\n", 1); }
# which looks bad when make -j interleaves two of these at about the same time.

# so assume that $(info ...) works if this feature is present.
