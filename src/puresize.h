   At one point, this was defined in config.h, meaning that changing
   PURESIZE would make Make recompile all of Emacs.  But only a few
   files actually use PURESIZE, so we split it out to its own .h file.

   Make sure to include this file after config.h, since that tells us

   storage to allocate.  */
