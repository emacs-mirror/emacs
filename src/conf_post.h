   EMACS_EXTERN_INLINE is no longer the default, as 'static' seems to
   have better performance with GCC.

   An include file foo.h should prepend INLINE to function
   definitions, with the following overall pattern:

      [#include any other .h files first.]
      ...
      INLINE_HEADER_BEGIN

      }
      ...
      INLINE_HEADER_END

   For every executable, exactly one file that includes the header
   should do this:

      #define INLINE EXTERN_INLINE

   before including config.h or any other .h file.
   Other .c files should not define INLINE.
   For Emacs, this is done by having emacs.c first '#define INLINE
   EXTERN_INLINE' and then include every .h file that uses INLINE.

   The INLINE_HEADER_BEGIN and INLINE_HEADER_END macros suppress bogus
   warnings in some GCC versions; see ../m4/extern-inline.m4.  */
