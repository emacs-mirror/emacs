/* The tree and node structs are mainly here, so they can be

   node.end directly, is while the node is not part of any tree.

   NOTE: It is safe to read node.begin and node.end directly, if the
   node came from an iterator, because it validates the nodes it
   returns as a side-effect.  See ITREE_FOREACH.

  /* The following five fields comprise the interval abstraction.

     BEGIN, END are buffer positions describing the range.  When a
     node is in a tree these fields are read only, written only by
     itree functions.

     The LIMIT, OFFSET and OTICK fields should be considered internal
     to itree.c and used only by itree functions.

     LIMIT is a buffer position, the maximum of END of this node and
     its children.  See itree.c for its use.

     OFFSET is in buffer position units, and will be non-zero only
     when the node is dirty.

     OTICK determines whether BEGIN, END, LIMIT and OFFSET are
     considered dirty.  A node is clean when its OTICK is equal to the
     OTICK of its tree (see struct itree_tree).  Otherwise, it is
     dirty.

     In a clean node, BEGIN, END and LIMIT are correct buffer
     positions, and OFFSET is zero.  The parent of a clean node is
     also clean, recursively.

     In a dirty node, the node's OTICK won't equal its tree's OTICK,
     and its OFFSET may be non-zero.  At all times the descendents of
     a dirty node are also dirty.  BEGIN, END and LIMIT require
     adjustment before use as buffer positions.

     NOTE: BEGIN and END must not be modified while the node is part
     of a tree.  Use itree_insert_gap and itree_delete_gap instead.

     NOTE: The interval iterators ensure nodes are clean before
     yielding them, so BEGIN and END may be safely used as buffer
     positions then.  */
