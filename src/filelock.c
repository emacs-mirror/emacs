/* Normally use a symbolic link to represent a lock.
   The strategy: to lock a file FN, create a symlink .#FN in FN's
   directory, with link data USER@HOST.PID:BOOT.  This avoids a single
   mount (== failure) point for lock files.  The :BOOT is omitted if
   the boot time is not available.

   When the host in the lock data is the current host, we can check if
   the pid is valid with kill.

   Otherwise, we could look at a separate file that maps hostnames to
   reboot times to see if the remote pid can possibly be valid, since we
   don't want Emacs to have to communicate via pipes or sockets or
   whatever to other processes, either locally or remotely; rms says
   that's too unreliable.  Hence the separate file, which could
   theoretically be updated by daemons running separately -- but this
   whole idea is unimplemented; in practice, at least in our
   environment, it seems such stale locks arise fairly infrequently, and
   Emacs' standard methods of dealing with clashes suffice.

   We use symlinks instead of normal files because (1) they can be
   stored more efficiently on the filesystem, since the kernel knows
   they will be small, and (2) all the info about the lock can be read
   in a single system call (readlink).  Although we could use regular
   files to be useful on old systems lacking symlinks, nowadays
   virtually all such systems are probably single-user anyway, so it
   didn't seem worth the complication.

   Similarly, we don't worry about a possible 14-character limit on
   file names, because those are all the same systems that don't have
   symlinks.

   This is compatible with the locking scheme used by Interleaf (which
   has contributed this implementation for Emacs), and was designed by
   Karl Berry, Ethan Jacobson, Kimbo Mundy, and others.

   On some file systems, notably those of MS-Windows, symbolic links
   do not work well, so instead of a symlink .#FN -> USER@HOST.PID:BOOT,
   the lock is a regular file .#FN with contents USER@HOST.PID:BOOT.  To
   establish a lock, a nonce file is created and then renamed to .#FN.
   On MS-Windows this renaming is atomic unless the lock is forcibly
   acquired.  On other systems the renaming is atomic if the lock is
   forcibly acquired; if not, the renaming is done via hard links,
   which is good enough for lock-file purposes.

   To summarize, race conditions can occur with either:

   * Forced locks on MS-Windows systems.

   * Non-forced locks on non-MS-Windows systems that support neither
     hard nor symbolic links.  */
