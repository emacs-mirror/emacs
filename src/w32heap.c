  Memory allocation scheme for w32/w64:

  - Buffers are mmap'ed using a very simple emulation of mmap/munmap
  - During the temacs phase:
    * we use a private heap declared to be stored into the `dumped_data'
    * unfortunately, this heap cannot be made growable, so the size of
      blocks it can allocate is limited to (0x80000 - pagesize)
    * the blocks that are larger than this are allocated from the end
      of the `dumped_data' array; there are not so many of them.
      We use a very simple first-fit scheme to reuse those blocks.
    * we check that the private heap does not cross the area used
      by the bigger chunks.
  - During the emacs phase:
    * we create a private heap for new memory blocks
    * we make sure that we never free a block that has been dumped.
      Freeing a dumped block could work in principle, but may prove
      unreliable if we distribute binaries of emacs.exe: MS does not
      guarantee that the heap data structures are the same across all
      versions of their OS, even though the API is available since XP.  */

   This point deserves an explanation.

   The W32 heap allocator can be used for a growable heap or a
   non-growable one.

   A growable heap is not compatible with a fixed base address for the
   heap.  Only a non-growable one is.  One drawback of non-growable
   heaps is that they can hold only objects smaller than a certain
   size (the one defined below).  Most of the larger blocks are GC'ed
   before dumping.  In any case, and to be safe, we implement a simple
   first-fit allocation algorithm starting at the end of the
   dumped_data[] array as depicted below:
