     Since the registers are now dynamically allocated, we need to make

     The regex code keeps track of whether it has allocated the search
     buffer using bits in the re_pattern_buffer.  This means that whenever
     you compile a new pattern, it completely forgets whether it has
     allocated any registers, and will allocate new registers the next
     time you call a searching or matching function.  Therefore, we need
