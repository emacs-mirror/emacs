Requirements
------------
Mac OS X 10.6 or later

- or -

GNUstep "Startup 0.23" or later
Tested on GNU/Linux, may work on other systems.


Compilation
-----------

In the top-level directory, use:

  ./configure --with-ns

(On macOS, --with-ns is enabled by default.)

Then run:

  make

This will compile all the files.

In order to run Emacs, you must run:

  src/emacs

In order to install Emacs, you must run:

  make install

This will assemble the app in nextstep/Emacs.app (i.e., the --prefix
argument has no effect in this case).  You can then move the Emacs.app
bundle to a location of your choice.

If you pass the --disable-ns-self-contained option to configure, the lisp
files will be installed under whatever 'prefix' is set to (defaults to
/usr/local).  The bundle will be smaller, but depend on these resources (may
require 'sudo' for "make install").


Installation
------------

Move nextstep/Emacs.app to any desired install location.
