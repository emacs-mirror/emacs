  dnl On many systems, time_t is already a 64-bit type.
  dnl On those systems where time_t is still 32-bit, it requires kernel
  dnl and libc support to make it 64-bit. For glibc 2.34 and later on Linux,
  dnl defining _TIME_BITS=64 and _FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 is needed on x86 and ARM.
  dnl
  dnl On native Windows, the system include files define types __time32_t
  dnl and __time64_t. By default, time_t is an alias of
  dnl   - __time32_t on 32-bit mingw,
  dnl   - __time64_t on 64-bit mingw and on MSVC (since MSVC 8).
  dnl But when compiling with -D__MINGW_USE_VC2005_COMPAT, time_t is an
  dnl alias of __time64_t.
  dnl And when compiling with -D_USE_32BIT_TIME_T, time_t is an alias of
  dnl __time32_t.
