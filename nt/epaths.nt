/* Hey Emacs, this is -*- C -*- code!  */
/* epaths.in file for MS-Windows build that uses the configure script.

   Since Emacs on Windows must be relocatable to any directory, it
   cannot have here hard-coded directories determined at configure
   time.  Therefore, each directory must begin with %emacs_dir%, which
   is resolved at startup to the root of the Emacs installation tree
   (see w32.c:init_environment).

   This file is edited at configure time to replace @VER@ by the Emacs
   version being built (e.g., 25.9.77), @CFG@ by the canonical name of
   the host system (e.g., i686-pc-mingw32), and @SRC@ by the root of
   the Emacs source tree used to build Emacs.  */
