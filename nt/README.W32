			   Emacs for Windows

  This README.W32 file describes how to set up and run a precompiled
  distribution of GNU Emacs for Windows.  You can find the precompiled
  distribution on the ftp.gnu.org server and its mirrors:

   	ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/windows/

  This server contains other distributions, including the full Emacs
  source distribution, as well as older releases of Emacs for Windows.

  Information on how to compile Emacs from sources on Windows is in
  the files README and INSTALL in the nt/ sub-directory of the
  top-level Emacs directory in the source distribution.  If you
  received this file as part of the Emacs source distribution, and are
  looking for information on how to build Emacs on MS-Windows, please
  read those 2 files and not this one.

* Preliminaries

  The binary distribution has these top-level directories:
  + bin
  + libexec
  + share
  + var

* Setting up Emacs

  To install Emacs, simply unpack the binary package into a directory
  of your choice.  To complete the installation process, you can
  optionally run the program addpm.exe in the bin subdirectory.  This
  will put an icon for Emacs in the Start Menu under
  "Start -> Programs -> Gnu Emacs".

  Some users have reported that the Start Menu item is not created for
  them.  If this happens, just create your own shortcut to runemacs.exe,
  eg. by dragging it on to the desktop or the Start button.

  Note that running addpm is now an optional step; Emacs is able to
  locate all of its files without needing any information to be set in
  the environment or the registry, although such settings will still
  be obeyed if present.  This is convenient for running Emacs on a
  machine which disallows registry changes, or on which software
  should not be installed.  For instance, you can now run Emacs
  directly from a CD or USB flash drive without copying or installing
  anything on the machine itself.

* Prerequisites for Windows 9X

  To run Emacs on Windows 9X (Windows 95/98/Me), you will need to have
  the Microsoft Layer for Unicode (MSLU) installed.  It can be
  downloaded from the Microsoft site, and comes in a form of a single
  dynamic library called UNICOWS.DLL.  If this library is not
  accessible to Emacs, it will pop up a dialog saying that it cannot
  find the library, and will refuse to start up.

* Starting Emacs

  To run Emacs, simply select Emacs from the Start Menu, or invoke
  runemacs.exe directly from Explorer or from a command prompt.  This
  will start Emacs in its default GUI mode, ready to use.  If you have
  never used Emacs before, you should follow the tutorial at this
  point (select Emacs Tutorial from the Help menu), since Emacs is
  quite different from ordinary Windows applications in many respects.

  If you want to use Emacs in tty or character mode within a command
  window, you can start it by typing "emacs -nw" at the command prompt.
  (Obviously, you need to ensure that the Emacs bin subdirectory is in
  your PATH first, or specify the path to emacs.exe.)  The -nw
  (non-windowed) mode of operation is most useful if you have a telnet
  server on your machine, allowing you to run Emacs remotely.

* EXE files included

  Emacs comes with the following executable files in the bin directory.

  + emacs.exe - The main Emacs executable.  As this is designed to run
    as both a text-mode application (emacs -nw) and as a GUI application,
    it will pop up a command prompt window if run directly from Explorer.

  + runemacs.exe - A wrapper for running Emacs as a GUI application
    without popping up a command prompt window.  If you create a
    desktop shortcut for invoking Emacs, make it point to this
    executable, not to emacs.exe.

  + emacsclient.exe - A command-line client program that can
    communicate with a running Emacs process.  See the `Emacs Server'
    node of the Emacs manual.

  + emacsclientw.exe - A version of emacsclient that does not open
    a command-line window.

  + addpm.exe - A basic installer that creates Start Menu icons for Emacs.
    Running this is optional.

  + ctags.exe, etags.exe - Tools for generating tag files.  See the
    `Tags' node of the Emacs manual.

  + ebrowse.exe - A tool for generating C++ browse information.  See the
    `Ebrowse' manual.

  Several helper programs are in a version-specific subdirectory of
  the libexec directory:

  + cmdproxy.exe - Used internally by Emacs to work around problems with
    the native shells in various versions of Windows.

  + ddeclient.exe - A tool for interacting with DDE servers.  To be
    invoked as "ddeclient SERVER [TOPIC]", where SERVER is the DDE
    server name, and sends each line of its standard input to the DDE
    server using the DdeClientTransaction API.  This program is
    supposed to be invoked via the 'call-process-region' Emacs
    primitive.

  + hexl.exe - A tool for producing hex dumps of binary files.  See the
    `Editing Binary Files' node of the Emacs manual.

  + movemail.exe - A helper application for safely moving mail from
    a mail spool or POP server to a local user mailbox.  See the
    `Movemail' node of the Emacs manual.

  + profile.exe - A helper program that generates periodic events for
    profiling Emacs Lisp code.

  + update-game-score.exe - A utility for updating the score files of
    Emacs games.

* Image support

  Emacs has built in support for XBM and PPM/PGM/PBM images, and the
  libXpm library is bundled, providing XPM support (required for color
  toolbar icons and splash screen).  Source for libXpm should be available
  from the same place from which you got this binary distribution.

  Emacs can also support some other image formats with appropriate
  libraries.  These libraries are all available on the following sites:

  1. http://sourceforge.net/projects/ezwinports/files/
     -- leaner, more up-to-date builds, only for 32-bit Emacs
  2. http://www.gtk.org/download/win32.php
     http://www.gtk.org/download/win64.php
     -- the GTK project site; offers much fatter builds, but includes
        64-bit DLLs (from the 2nd URL)
  3. GnuWin32 project -- very old builds, not recommended

  The libraries to download are mentioned below.  Some libraries
  depend on others that need to be downloaded separately from the same
  site; please consult the download instructions on each site for the
  details.  In general, the ezwinports site mentioned above has all
  the dependencies bundled in the same zip archive, so installing from
  there is the easiest.

  Emacs will find these libraries if the directory they are installed
  in is on the PATH or in the same directory where you have emacs.exe.
  Here are some specific comments about each image type:

      PNG: requires the PNG reference library 1.4 or later, which will
      be named libpngNN.dll or libpngNN-NN.dll.  LibPNG requires zlib,
      which should come from the same source as you got libpng.
      Starting with Emacs 23.3, the precompiled Emacs binaries are
      built with libpng 1.4.x and later, and are incompatible with
      earlier versions of libpng DLLs.  So if you have libpng 1.2.x,
      the PNG support will not work, and you will have to download
      newer versions.

      JPEG: requires the Independent JPEG Group's libjpeg 6b or later,
      which will be called jpeg62.dll, libjpeg.dll, jpeg-62.dll or jpeg.dll.

      TIFF: requires libTIFF 3.0 or later, which will be called libtiffN.dll
      or libtiff-N.dll or libtiff.dll.

      GIF: requires libungif or giflib 4.1 or later, which will be
      called libgif-6.dll, giflib4.dll, libungif4.dll or libungif.dll.

      SVG: requires librsvg 2.x whose DLL will be called
      librsvg-2-2.dll.  SVG also requires several dependency DLLs,
      such as Pango, Cairo, and Glib, all of them found on the
      above-mentioned sites.  If you download from the ezwinports
      site, you need only librsvg-2.nn.mm-x-w32-bin.zip, it comes with
      all the other dependencies bundled.

   If you have image support DLLs under different names, customize the
   value of `dynamic-library-alist'.

* GnuTLS support

  GnuTLS provides SSL/TLS network support for Emacs (https, imaps and
  so on.)

  In order to support GnuTLS at runtime, Emacs must be able to find
  the relevant DLLs during startup; failure to do so is not an error,
  but GnuTLS won't be available to the running session.

  You can get pre-built binaries (including any dependency DLLs) at
  http://sourceforge.net/projects/ezwinports/files/.

* libxml2 support

  libxml2 provides HTML parsing support for Emacs, which is necessary
  to use the built-in eww browser.

  In order to support libxml2 at runtime, a libxml2-enabled Emacs must
  be able to find the relevant DLLs during startup; failure to do so
  is not an error, but libxml2 features won't be available to the
  running session.

  You can get pre-built binaries (including any required DLL and the
  header files) at http://sourceforge.net/projects/ezwinports/files/.

* Uninstalling Emacs

  If you should need to uninstall Emacs, simply delete all the files
  and subdirectories from the directory where it was unpacked (Emacs
  does not install or update any files in system directories or
  anywhere else).  If you ran the addpm.exe program to create the
  registry entries and the Start menu icon, then you can remove the
  registry entries using regedit.  All of the settings are written
  under the Software\GNU\Emacs key in HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, or if you
  didn't have administrator privileges when you installed, the same
  key in HKEY_CURRENT_USER.  Just delete the whole Software\GNU\Emacs
  key.

  The Start menu entry can be removed by right-clicking on the Taskbar
  and selecting Properties, then using the Remove option on the Start
  Menu Programs page.  (If you installed under an account with
  administrator privileges, then you need to click the Advanced button
  and look for the Gnu Emacs menu item under All Users.)

* Troubleshooting

  Unpacking the distributions

  If you encounter trouble trying to run Emacs, there are a number of
  possible causes.  Check the following for indications that the
  distribution was not corrupted by the tools used to unpack it:

    * Be sure to disable CR/LF translation or the executables will
      be unusable.  Older versions of WinZipNT would enable this
      translation by default.  If you are using WinZipNT, disable it.
      (I don't have WinZipNT myself, and I do not know the specific
      commands necessary to disable it.)

    * Check that filenames were not truncated to 8.3.  For example,
      there should be a file lisp\abbrevlist.elc; if this has been
      truncated to abbrevli.elc, your distribution has been corrupted
      while unpacking and Emacs will not start.

    * On Windows 9X, make sure you have the UNICOWS.DLL library either
      in the same directory where you have emacs.exe or in the
      directory where system-wide DLLs are kept.

  If you believe you have unpacked the distributions correctly and are
  still encountering problems, see the section on Further Information
  below.

  Virus scanners

  Some virus scanners interfere with Emacs' use of subprocesses.  If you
  are unable to use subprocesses and you use Dr. Solomon's WinGuard or
  McAfee's Vshield, turn off "Scan all files" (WinGuard) or "boot sector
  scanning" (McAfee exclusion properties).

* Further information

  The Emacs User manual describes Windows-specific issues in the
  appendix named "Emacs and Microsoft Windows/MS-DOS".  You can read
  it in Emacs by typing

        C-h r g Microsoft Windows RET

  This appendix is also available (as part of the entire manual) at

        http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/emacs.html#Microsoft-Windows

  In addition to the manual, there is a mailing list for discussing
  issues related to the Windows port of Emacs.  For information about
  the list, see this Web page:

	http://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/help-emacs-windows

  To ask questions on the mailing list, send email to
  help-emacs-windows@gnu.org.  (You don't need to subscribe for that.)
  To subscribe to the list or unsubscribe from it, fill the form you
  find at http://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/help-emacs-windows as
  explained there.

  Another valuable source of information and help which should not be
  overlooked is the various Usenet news groups dedicated to Emacs.
  These are particularly good for help with general issues which aren't
  specific to the Windows port of Emacs.  The main news groups to use
  for seeking help are:

	gnu.emacs.help
	comp.emacs

  There are also fairly regular postings and announcements of new or
  updated Emacs packages on this group:

	gnu.emacs.sources

* Reporting bugs

  If you encounter a bug in this port of Emacs, we would like to hear
  about it.  First check the FAQ on the web page above to see if the bug
  is already known and if there are any workarounds.  Then check whether
  the bug has something to do with code in your .emacs file, e.g. by
  invoking Emacs with the "-Q" option.

  If you decide that it is a bug in Emacs, use the built in bug
  reporting facility to report it (from the menu; Help -> Send Bug Report).
  If you have not yet configured Emacs for mail, then when you press
  C-c C-c to send the report, it will ask you to paste the text of the
  report into your mail client.  If the bug is related to subprocesses,
  also specify which shell you are using (e.g., include the values of
  `shell-file-name' and `explicit-shell-file-name' in your message).

  Enjoy!
