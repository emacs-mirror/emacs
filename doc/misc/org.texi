@c Macro definitions for commands and keys
@c =======================================

@c The behavior of the key/command macros will depend on the flag cmdnames
@c When set, commands names are shown.  When clear, they are not shown.

@set cmdnames

@c Below we define the following macros for Org key tables:

@c orgkey{key}                        A key item
@c orgcmd{key,cmd}                    Key with command name
@c xorgcmd{key,cmd}                   Key with command name as @itemx
@c orgcmdnki{key,cmd}                 Like orgcmd, but do not index the key
@c orgcmdtkc{text,key,cmd}            Like orgcmd,special text instead of key
@c orgcmdkkc{key1,key2,cmd}           Two keys with one command name, use "or"
@c orgcmdkxkc{key1,key2,cmd}          Two keys with one command name, but
@c                                    different functions, so format as @itemx
@c orgcmdkskc{key1,key2,cmd}          Same as orgcmdkkc, but use "or short"
@c xorgcmdkskc{key1,key2,cmd}         Same as previous, but use @itemx

@section Summary
@cindex summary

Org is a mode for keeping notes, maintaining TODO lists, and doing
project planning with a fast and effective plain-text system.

Org develops organizational tasks around NOTES files that contain
lists or information about projects as plain text.  Org is
implemented on top of Outline mode, which makes it possible to keep the
content of large files well structured.  Visibility cycling and
structure editing help to work with the tree.  Tables are easily created
with a built-in table editor.  Org supports TODO items, deadlines,
timestamps, and scheduling.  It dynamically compiles entries into an
agenda that utilizes and smoothly integrates much of the Emacs calendar
and diary.  Plain text URL-like links connect to websites, emails,
Usenet messages, BBDB entries, and any files related to the projects.
For printing and sharing notes, an Org file can be exported as a
structured ASCII file, as HTML, or (TODO and agenda items only) as an
iCalendar file.  It can also serve as a publishing tool for a set of
linked web pages.

As a project planning environment, Org works by adding metadata to outline
nodes.  Based on this data, specific entries can be extracted in queries and
create dynamic @i{agenda views}.

Org mode contains the Org Babel environment which allows you to work with
embedded source code blocks in a file, to facilitate code evaluation,
documentation, and literate programming techniques.

Org's automatic, context-sensitive table editor with spreadsheet
capabilities can be integrated into any major mode by activating the
minor Orgtbl mode.  Using a translation step, it can be used to maintain
tables in arbitrary file types, for example in @LaTeX{}.  The structure
editing and list creation capabilities can be used outside Org with
the minor Orgstruct mode.

Org keeps simple things simple.  When first fired up, it should
feel like a straightforward, easy to use outliner.  Complexity is not
imposed, but a large amount of functionality is available when you need
it.  Org is a toolbox and can be used in different ways and for different
ends, for example:

@example
@r{@bullet{} an outline extension with visibility cycling and structure editing}
@r{@bullet{} an ASCII system and table editor for taking structured notes}
@r{@bullet{} a TODO list editor}
@r{@bullet{} a full agenda and planner with deadlines and work scheduling}
@pindex GTD, Getting Things Done
@r{@bullet{} an environment in which to implement David Allen's GTD system}
@r{@bullet{} a simple hypertext system, with HTML and @LaTeX{} export}
@r{@bullet{} a publishing tool to create a set of interlinked web pages}
@r{@bullet{} an environment for literate programming}

@node Installation, Activation, Summary, Introduction
@section Installation
@cindex installation
@cindex XEmacs

Org is part of recent distributions of GNU Emacs, so you normally don't need
to install it.  If, for one reason or another, you want to install Org on top
of this pre-packaged version, there are three ways to do it:

@itemize @bullet
@item By using Emacs package system.
@item By downloading Org as an archive.
@item By using Org's git repository.
@end itemize

We @b{strongly recommend} to stick to a single installation method.

@subsubheading Using Emacs packaging system

Recent Emacs distributions include a packaging system which lets you install
Elisp libraries.  You can install Org with @kbd{M-x package-install RET org}.

@noindent @b{Important}: you need to do this in a session where no @code{.org} file has
been visited, i.e., where no Org built-in function have been loaded.
Otherwise autoload Org functions will mess up the installation.

Then, to make sure your Org configuration is taken into account, initialize
the package system with @code{(package-initialize)} in your @file{.emacs}
before setting any Org option.  If you want to use Org's package repository,
check out the @uref{http://orgmode.org/elpa.html, Org ELPA page}.

@subsubheading Downloading Org as an archive

You can download Org latest release from @uref{http://orgmode.org/, Org's
website}.  In this case, make sure you set the load-path correctly in your
@file{.emacs}:

@lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/path/to/orgdir/lisp")
@end lisp

The downloaded archive contains contributed libraries that are not included
in Emacs.  If you want to use them, add the @file{contrib} directory to your
load-path:

@lisp
(add-to-list 'load-path "~/path/to/orgdir/contrib/lisp" t)
@end lisp

Optionally, you can compile the files and/or install them in your system.
Run @code{make help} to list compilation and installation options.

@subsubheading Using Org's git repository

You can clone Org's repository and install Org like this:

@example
$ cd ~/src/
$ git clone git://orgmode.org/org-mode.git
$ make autoloads
@end example

Note that in this case, @code{make autoloads} is mandatory: it defines Org's
version in @file{org-version.el} and Org's autoloads in
@file{org-loaddefs.el}.

Remember to add the correct load-path as described in the method above.

You can also compile with @code{make}, generate the documentation with
@code{make doc}, create a local configuration with @code{make config} and
install Org with @code{make install}.  Please run @code{make help} to get
the list of compilation/installation options.

For more detailed explanations on Org's build system, please check the Org
Build System page on @uref{http://orgmode.org/worg/dev/org-build-system.html,
Worg}.

@cindex key bindings, global
@findex org-agenda
@findex org-capture
@findex org-store-link
@findex org-iswitchb

Since Emacs 22.2, files with the @file{.org} extension use Org mode by
default.  If you are using an earlier version of Emacs, add this line to your
@file{.emacs} file:

@lisp
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.org\\'" . org-mode))
@end lisp

Org mode buffers need font-lock to be turned on: this is the default in
Emacs@footnote{If you don't use font-lock globally, turn it on in Org buffer
with @code{(add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'turn-on-font-lock)}}.

There are compatibility issues between Org mode and some other Elisp
packages, please take the time to check the list (@pxref{Conflicts}).

The four Org commands @command{org-store-link}, @command{org-capture},
@command{org-agenda}, and @command{org-iswitchb} should be accessible through
global keys (i.e., anywhere in Emacs, not just in Org buffers).  Here are
suggested bindings for these keys, please modify the keys to your own
liking.
@lisp
(global-set-key "\C-cl" 'org-store-link)
(global-set-key "\C-cc" 'org-capture)
(global-set-key "\C-ca" 'org-agenda)
(global-set-key "\C-cb" 'org-iswitchb)
@end lisp

@cindex Org mode, turning on
With this setup, all files with extension @samp{.org} will be put
into Org mode.  As an alternative, make the first line of a file look
like this:

@example
MY PROJECTS    -*- mode: org; -*-
@end example

@vindex org-insert-mode-line-in-empty-file
@noindent which will select Org mode for this buffer no matter what
the file's name is.  See also the variable
@code{org-insert-mode-line-in-empty-file}.

Many commands in Org work on the region if the region is @i{active}.  To make
use of this, you need to have @code{transient-mark-mode}
(@code{zmacs-regions} in XEmacs) turned on.  In Emacs 23 this is the default,
in Emacs 22 you need to do this yourself with
@lisp
(transient-mark-mode 1)
@end lisp
@noindent If you do not like @code{transient-mark-mode}, you can create an
active region by using the mouse to select a region, or pressing
@kbd{C-@key{SPC}} twice before moving the cursor.

@node Feedback, Conventions, Activation, Introduction
@section Feedback
@cindex feedback
@cindex bug reports
@cindex maintainer
@cindex author

If you find problems with Org, or if you have questions, remarks, or ideas
about it, please mail to the Org mailing list @email{emacs-orgmode@@gnu.org}.
If you are not a member of the mailing list, your mail will be passed to the
list after a moderator has approved it@footnote{Please consider subscribing
to the mailing list, in order to minimize the work the mailing list
moderators have to do.}.

For bug reports, please first try to reproduce the bug with the latest
version of Org available---if you are running an outdated version, it is
quite possible that the bug has been fixed already.  If the bug persists,
prepare a report and provide as much information as possible, including the
version information of Emacs (@kbd{M-x emacs-version @key{RET}}) and Org
(@kbd{M-x org-version RET}), as well as the Org related setup in
@file{.emacs}.  The easiest way to do this is to use the command
@example
@kbd{M-x org-submit-bug-report RET}
@end example
@noindent which will put all this information into an Emacs mail buffer so
that you only need to add your description.  If you re not sending the Email
from within Emacs, please copy and paste the content into your Email program.

Sometimes you might face a problem due to an error in your Emacs or Org mode
setup.  Before reporting a bug, it is very helpful to start Emacs with minimal
customizations and reproduce the problem.  Doing so often helps you determine
if the problem is with your customization or with Org mode itself.  You can
start a typical minimal session with a command like the example below.

@example
$ emacs -Q -l /path/to/minimal-org.el
@end example

However if you are using Org mode as distributed with Emacs, a minimal setup
is not necessary.  In that case it is sufficient to start Emacs as
@code{emacs -Q}.  The @code{minimal-org.el} setup file can have contents as
shown below.

@lisp
;;; Minimal setup to load latest 'org-mode'

;; activate debugging
(setq debug-on-error t
      debug-on-signal nil
      debug-on-quit nil)

;; add latest org-mode to load path
(add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "/path/to/org-mode/lisp"))
(add-to-list 'load-path (expand-file-name "/path/to/org-mode/contrib/lisp" t))
@end lisp

If an error occurs, a backtrace can be very useful (see below on how to
create one).  Often a small example file helps, along with clear information
about:

@enumerate
@item What exactly did you do?
@item What did you expect to happen?
@item What happened instead?
@end enumerate
@noindent Thank you for helping to improve this program.

@subsubheading How to create a useful backtrace

@cindex backtrace of an error
If working with Org produces an error with a message you don't
understand, you may have hit a bug.  The best way to report this is by
providing, in addition to what was mentioned above, a @emph{backtrace}.
This is information from the built-in debugger about where and how the
error occurred.  Here is how to produce a useful backtrace:

@enumerate
@item
Reload uncompiled versions of all Org mode Lisp files.  The backtrace
contains much more information if it is produced with uncompiled code.
To do this, use
@example
@kbd{C-u M-x org-reload RET}
@end example
@noindent
or select @code{Org -> Refresh/Reload -> Reload Org uncompiled} from the
menu.
@item
Go to the @code{Options} menu and select @code{Enter Debugger on Error}
(XEmacs has this option in the @code{Troubleshooting} sub-menu).
@item
Do whatever you have to do to hit the error.  Don't forget to
document the steps you take.
@item
When you hit the error, a @file{*Backtrace*} buffer will appear on the
screen.  Save this buffer to a file (for example using @kbd{C-x C-w}) and
attach it to your bug report.
@end enumerate

@node Conventions,  , Feedback, Introduction
@section Typesetting conventions used in this manual

@subsubheading TODO keywords, tags, properties, etc.

Org mainly uses three types of keywords: TODO keywords, tags and property
names.  In this manual we use the following conventions:

@table @code
@item TODO
@itemx WAITING
TODO keywords are written with all capitals, even if they are
user-defined.
@item boss
@itemx ARCHIVE
User-defined tags are written in lowercase; built-in tags with special
meaning are written with all capitals.
@item Release
@itemx PRIORITY
User-defined properties are capitalized; built-in properties with
special meaning are written with all capitals.
@end table

Moreover, Org uses @i{option keywords} (like @code{#+TITLE} to set the title)
and @i{environment keywords} (like @code{#+BEGIN_HTML} to start a @code{HTML}
environment).  They are written in uppercase in the manual to enhance its
readability, but you can use lowercase in your Org files@footnote{Easy
templates insert lowercase keywords and Babel dynamically inserts
@code{#+results}.}.

@subsubheading Keybindings and commands
@kindex C-c a
@findex org-agenda
@kindex C-c c
@findex org-capture

The manual suggests two global keybindings: @kbd{C-c a} for @code{org-agenda}
and @kbd{C-c c} for @code{org-capture}.  These are only suggestions, but the
rest of the manual assumes that you are using these keybindings.

Also, the manual lists both the keys and the corresponding commands for
accessing a functionality.  Org mode often uses the same key for different
functions, depending on context.  The command that is bound to such keys has
a generic name, like @code{org-metaright}.  In the manual we will, wherever
possible, give the function that is internally called by the generic command.
For example, in the chapter on document structure, @kbd{M-@key{right}} will
be listed to call @code{org-do-demote}, while in the chapter on tables, it
will be listed to call @code{org-table-move-column-right}.  If you prefer,
you can compile the manual without the command names by unsetting the flag
@code{cmdnames} in @file{org.texi}.

@node Outlines, Headlines, Document Structure, Document Structure
@section Outlines
@cindex outlines
@cindex Outline mode

Org is implemented on top of Outline mode.  Outlines allow a
document to be organized in a hierarchical structure, which (at least
for me) is the best representation of notes and thoughts.  An overview
of this structure is achieved by folding (hiding) large parts of the
document to show only the general document structure and the parts
currently being worked on.  Org greatly simplifies the use of
outlines by compressing the entire show/hide functionality into a single
command, @command{org-cycle}, which is bound to the @key{TAB} key.

@node Headlines, Visibility cycling, Outlines, Document Structure
@section Headlines
@cindex headlines
@cindex outline tree
@vindex org-special-ctrl-a/e
@vindex org-special-ctrl-k
@vindex org-ctrl-k-protect-subtree

Headlines define the structure of an outline tree.  The headlines in Org
start with one or more stars, on the left margin@footnote{See the variables
@code{org-special-ctrl-a/e}, @code{org-special-ctrl-k}, and
@code{org-ctrl-k-protect-subtree} to configure special behavior of @kbd{C-a},
@kbd{C-e}, and @kbd{C-k} in headlines.} @footnote{Clocking only works with
headings indented less then 30 stars.}.  For example:

@example
* Top level headline
** Second level
*** 3rd level
    some text
*** 3rd level
    more text

* Another top level headline
@end example

@noindent Some people find the many stars too noisy and would prefer an
outline that has whitespace followed by a single star as headline
starters.  @ref{Clean view}, describes a setup to realize this.

@vindex org-cycle-separator-lines
An empty line after the end of a subtree is considered part of it and
will be hidden when the subtree is folded.  However, if you leave at
least two empty lines, one empty line will remain visible after folding
the subtree, in order to structure the collapsed view.  See the
variable @code{org-cycle-separator-lines} to modify this behavior.

@subsection Global and local cycling

Outlines make it possible to hide parts of the text in the buffer.
Org uses just two commands, bound to @key{TAB} and
@kbd{S-@key{TAB}} to change the visibility in the buffer.

@cindex subtree visibility states
@cindex subtree cycling
@cindex folded, subtree visibility state
@cindex children, subtree visibility state
@cindex subtree, subtree visibility state
@table @asis
@orgcmd{@key{TAB},org-cycle}
@emph{Subtree cycling}: Rotate current subtree among the states

@example
,-> FOLDED -> CHILDREN -> SUBTREE --.
'-----------------------------------'
@end example

@vindex org-cycle-emulate-tab
@vindex org-cycle-global-at-bob
The cursor must be on a headline for this to work@footnote{see, however,
the option @code{org-cycle-emulate-tab}.}.  When the cursor is at the
beginning of the buffer and the first line is not a headline, then
@key{TAB} actually runs global cycling (see below)@footnote{see the
option @code{org-cycle-global-at-bob}.}.  Also when called with a prefix
argument (@kbd{C-u @key{TAB}}), global cycling is invoked.

@cindex global visibility states
@cindex global cycling
@cindex overview, global visibility state
@cindex contents, global visibility state
@cindex show all, global visibility state
@orgcmd{S-@key{TAB},org-global-cycle}
@itemx C-u @key{TAB}
@emph{Global cycling}: Rotate the entire buffer among the states

@example
,-> OVERVIEW -> CONTENTS -> SHOW ALL --.
'--------------------------------------'
@end example

When @kbd{S-@key{TAB}} is called with a numeric prefix argument N, the
CONTENTS view up to headlines of level N will be shown.  Note that inside
tables, @kbd{S-@key{TAB}} jumps to the previous field.

@cindex set startup visibility, command
@orgcmd{C-u C-u @key{TAB},org-set-startup-visibility}
Switch back to the startup visibility of the buffer (@pxref{Initial visibility}).
@cindex show all, command
@orgcmd{C-u C-u C-u @key{TAB},show-all}
Show all, including drawers.
@cindex revealing context
@orgcmd{C-c C-r,org-reveal}
Reveal context around point, showing the current entry, the following heading
and the hierarchy above.  Useful for working near a location that has been
exposed by a sparse tree command (@pxref{Sparse trees}) or an agenda command
(@pxref{Agenda commands}).  With a prefix argument show, on each
level, all sibling headings.  With a double prefix argument, also show the
entire subtree of the parent.
@cindex show branches, command
@orgcmd{C-c C-k,show-branches}
Expose all the headings of the subtree, CONTENT view for just one subtree.
@cindex show children, command
@orgcmd{C-c @key{TAB},show-children}
Expose all direct children of the subtree.  With a numeric prefix argument N,
expose all children down to level N@.
@orgcmd{C-c C-x b,org-tree-to-indirect-buffer}
Show the current subtree in an indirect buffer@footnote{The indirect
buffer
@ifinfo
(@pxref{Indirect Buffers,,,emacs,GNU Emacs Manual})
@end ifinfo
@ifnotinfo
(see the Emacs manual for more information about indirect buffers)
@end ifnotinfo
will contain the entire buffer, but will be narrowed to the current
tree.  Editing the indirect buffer will also change the original buffer,
but without affecting visibility in that buffer.}.  With a numeric
prefix argument N, go up to level N and then take that tree.  If N is
negative then go up that many levels.  With a @kbd{C-u} prefix, do not remove
the previously used indirect buffer.
@orgcmd{C-c C-x v,org-copy-visible}
Copy the @i{visible} text in the region into the kill ring.

When Emacs first visits an Org file, the global state is set to OVERVIEW,
i.e., only the top level headlines are visible@footnote{When
@code{org-agenda-inhibit-startup} is non-@code{nil}, Org will not honor the default
visibility state when first opening a file for the agenda (@pxref{Speeding up
your agendas}).}.  This can be configured through the variable
@code{org-startup-folded}, or on a per-file basis by adding one of the
following lines anywhere in the buffer:

@example
#+STARTUP: overview
#+STARTUP: content
#+STARTUP: showall
#+STARTUP: showeverything
@end example

The startup visibility options are ignored when the file is open for the
first time during the agenda generation: if you want the agenda to honor
the startup visibility, set @code{org-agenda-inhibit-startup} to @code{nil}.

@cindex property, VISIBILITY

Furthermore, any entries with a @samp{VISIBILITY} property (@pxref{Properties

@table @asis
@orgcmd{M-@key{RET},org-insert-heading}
@vindex org-M-RET-may-split-line
Insert a new heading/item with the same level than the one at point.
If the cursor is in a plain list item, a new item is created
(@pxref{Plain lists}).  To prevent this behavior in lists, call the
command with a prefix argument.  When this command is used in the
middle of a line, the line is split and the rest of the line becomes
the new item or headline@footnote{If you do not want the line to be
split, customize the variable @code{org-M-RET-may-split-line}.}.  If
the command is used at the @emph{beginning} of a headline, the new
headline is created before the current line.  If the command is used
at the @emph{end} of a folded subtree (i.e., behind the ellipses at
the end of a headline), then a headline will be
inserted after the end of the subtree.  Calling this command with
@kbd{C-u C-u} will unconditionally respect the headline's content and
create a new item at the end of the parent subtree.
@orgcmd{C-@key{RET},org-insert-heading-respect-content}
Just like @kbd{M-@key{RET}}, except when adding a new heading below the
current heading, the new heading is placed after the body instead of before
it.  This command works from anywhere in the entry.
@orgcmd{M-S-@key{RET},org-insert-todo-heading}
@vindex org-treat-insert-todo-heading-as-state-change
Insert new TODO entry with same level as current heading.  See also the
variable @code{org-treat-insert-todo-heading-as-state-change}.
@orgcmd{C-S-@key{RET},org-insert-todo-heading-respect-content}
Insert new TODO entry with same level as current heading.  Like
@kbd{C-@key{RET}}, the new headline will be inserted after the current
subtree.
@orgcmd{@key{TAB},org-cycle}
In a new entry with no text yet, the first @key{TAB} demotes the entry to
become a child of the previous one.  The next @key{TAB} makes it a parent,
and so on, all the way to top level.  Yet another @key{TAB}, and you are back
to the initial level.
@orgcmd{M-@key{left},org-do-promote}
Promote current heading by one level.
@orgcmd{M-@key{right},org-do-demote}
Demote current heading by one level.
@orgcmd{M-S-@key{left},org-promote-subtree}
Promote the current subtree by one level.
@orgcmd{M-S-@key{right},org-demote-subtree}
Demote the current subtree by one level.
@orgcmd{M-S-@key{up},org-move-subtree-up}
Move subtree up (swap with previous subtree of same
level).
@orgcmd{M-S-@key{down},org-move-subtree-down}
Move subtree down (swap with next subtree of same level).
@orgcmd{M-h,org-mark-element}
Mark the element at point.  Hitting repeatedly will mark subsequent elements
of the one just marked.  E.g., hitting @key{M-h} on a paragraph will mark it,
hitting @key{M-h} immediately again will mark the next one.
@orgcmd{C-c @@,org-mark-subtree}
Mark the subtree at point.  Hitting repeatedly will mark subsequent subtrees
of the same level than the marked subtree.
@orgcmd{C-c C-x C-w,org-cut-subtree}
Kill subtree, i.e., remove it from buffer but save in kill ring.
With a numeric prefix argument N, kill N sequential subtrees.
@orgcmd{C-c C-x M-w,org-copy-subtree}
Copy subtree to kill ring.  With a numeric prefix argument N, copy the N
sequential subtrees.
@orgcmd{C-c C-x C-y,org-paste-subtree}
Yank subtree from kill ring.  This does modify the level of the subtree to
make sure the tree fits in nicely at the yank position.  The yank level can
also be specified with a numeric prefix argument, or by yanking after a
headline marker like @samp{****}.
@orgcmd{C-y,org-yank}
@vindex org-yank-adjusted-subtrees
@vindex org-yank-folded-subtrees
Depending on the options @code{org-yank-adjusted-subtrees} and
@code{org-yank-folded-subtrees}, Org's internal @code{yank} command will
paste subtrees folded and in a clever way, using the same command as @kbd{C-c
C-x C-y}.  With the default settings, no level adjustment will take place,
but the yanked tree will be folded unless doing so would swallow text
previously visible.  Any prefix argument to this command will force a normal
@code{yank} to be executed, with the prefix passed along.  A good way to
force a normal yank is @kbd{C-u C-y}.  If you use @code{yank-pop} after a
yank, it will yank previous kill items plainly, without adjustment and
folding.
@orgcmd{C-c C-x c,org-clone-subtree-with-time-shift}
Clone a subtree by making a number of sibling copies of it.  You will be
prompted for the number of copies to make, and you can also specify if any
timestamps in the entry should be shifted.  This can be useful, for example,
to create a number of tasks related to a series of lectures to prepare.  For
more details, see the docstring of the command
@code{org-clone-subtree-with-time-shift}.
@orgcmd{C-c C-w,org-refile}
Refile entry or region to a different location.  @xref{Refile and copy}.
@orgcmd{C-c ^,org-sort}
Sort same-level entries.  When there is an active region, all entries in the
region will be sorted.  Otherwise the children of the current headline are
sorted.  The command prompts for the sorting method, which can be
alphabetically, numerically, by time (first timestamp with active preferred,
creation time, scheduled time, deadline time), by priority, by TODO keyword
(in the sequence the keywords have been defined in the setup) or by the value
of a property.  Reverse sorting is possible as well.  You can also supply
your own function to extract the sorting key.  With a @kbd{C-u} prefix,
sorting will be case-sensitive.
@orgcmd{C-x n s,org-narrow-to-subtree}
Narrow buffer to current subtree.
@orgcmd{C-x n b,org-narrow-to-block}
Narrow buffer to current block.
@orgcmd{C-x n w,widen}
Widen buffer to remove narrowing.
@orgcmd{C-c *,org-toggle-heading}
Turn a normal line or plain list item into a headline (so that it becomes a
subheading at its location).  Also turn a headline into a normal line by
removing the stars.  If there is an active region, turn all lines in the
region into headlines.  If the first line in the region was an item, turn
only the item lines into headlines.  Finally, if the first line is a
headline, remove the stars from all headlines in the region.
@end table

@cindex region, active
@cindex active region
@cindex transient mark mode
When there is an active region (Transient Mark mode), promotion and
demotion work on all headlines in the region.  To select a region of
headlines, it is best to place both point and mark at the beginning of a
line, mark at the beginning of the first headline, and point at the line
just after the last headline to change.  Note that when the cursor is
inside a table (@pxref{Tables}), the Meta-Cursor keys have different
functionality.

@vindex org-show-hierarchy-above
@vindex org-show-following-heading
@vindex org-show-siblings
@vindex org-show-entry-below
An important feature of Org mode is the ability to construct @emph{sparse
trees} for selected information in an outline tree, so that the entire
document is folded as much as possible, but the selected information is made
visible along with the headline structure above it@footnote{See also the
variables @code{org-show-hierarchy-above}, @code{org-show-following-heading},
@code{org-show-siblings}, and @code{org-show-entry-below} for detailed
control on how much context is shown around each match.}.  Just try it out
and you will see immediately how it works.

Org mode contains several commands creating such trees, all these
commands can be accessed through a dispatcher:

@table @asis
@orgcmd{C-c /,org-sparse-tree}
This prompts for an extra key to select a sparse-tree creating command.
@orgcmd{C-c / r,org-occur}
@vindex org-remove-highlights-with-change
Prompts for a regexp and shows a sparse tree with all matches.  If
the match is in a headline, the headline is made visible.  If the match is in
the body of an entry, headline and body are made visible.  In order to
provide minimal context, also the full hierarchy of headlines above the match
is shown, as well as the headline following the match.  Each match is also
highlighted; the highlights disappear when the buffer is changed by an
editing command@footnote{This depends on the option
@code{org-remove-highlights-with-change}}, or by pressing @kbd{C-c C-c}.
When called with a @kbd{C-u} prefix argument, previous highlights are kept,
so several calls to this command can be stacked.
@orgcmdkkc{M-g n,M-g M-n,next-error}
Jump to the next sparse tree match in this buffer.
@orgcmdkkc{M-g p,M-g M-p,previous-error}
Jump to the previous sparse tree match in this buffer.
@end table

@noindent
@vindex org-agenda-custom-commands
For frequently used sparse trees of specific search strings, you can
use the option @code{org-agenda-custom-commands} to define fast
keyboard access to specific sparse trees.  These commands will then be
accessible through the agenda dispatcher (@pxref{Agenda dispatcher}).
For example:

@lisp
(setq org-agenda-custom-commands
      '(("f" occur-tree "FIXME")))
@end lisp

@noindent will define the key @kbd{C-c a f} as a shortcut for creating
a sparse tree matching the string @samp{FIXME}.

The other sparse tree commands select headings based on TODO keywords,
tags, or properties and will be discussed later in this manual.

@kindex C-c C-e C-v
@cindex printing sparse trees
@cindex visible text, printing
To print a sparse tree, you can use the Emacs command
@code{ps-print-buffer-with-faces} which does not print invisible parts
of the document @footnote{This does not work under XEmacs, because
XEmacs uses selective display for outlining, not text properties.}.
Or you can use @kbd{C-c C-e C-v} to export only the visible part of
the document and print the resulting file.

@node Plain lists, Drawers, Sparse trees, Document Structure
@section Plain lists
@cindex plain lists
@cindex lists, plain
@cindex lists, ordered
@cindex ordered lists

Within an entry of the outline tree, hand-formatted lists can provide
additional structure.  They also provide a way to create lists of checkboxes
(@pxref{Checkboxes}).  Org supports editing such lists, and every exporter
(@pxref{Exporting}) can parse and format them.

Org knows ordered lists, unordered lists, and description lists.
@itemize @bullet
@item
@emph{Unordered} list items start with @samp{-}, @samp{+}, or
@samp{*}@footnote{When using @samp{*} as a bullet, lines must be indented or
they will be seen as top-level headlines.  Also, when you are hiding leading
stars to get a clean outline view, plain list items starting with a star may
be hard to distinguish from true headlines.  In short: even though @samp{*}
is supported, it may be better to not use it for plain list items.}  as
bullets.
@item
@vindex org-plain-list-ordered-item-terminator
@vindex org-list-allow-alphabetical
@emph{Ordered} list items start with a numeral followed by either a period or
a right parenthesis@footnote{You can filter out any of them by configuring
@code{org-plain-list-ordered-item-terminator}.}, such as @samp{1.} or
@samp{1)}@footnote{You can also get @samp{a.}, @samp{A.}, @samp{a)} and
@samp{A)} by configuring @code{org-list-allow-alphabetical}.  To minimize
confusion with normal text, those are limited to one character only.  Beyond
that limit, bullets will automatically fallback to numbers.}.  If you want a
list to start with a different value (e.g., 20), start the text of the item
with @code{[@@20]}@footnote{If there's a checkbox in the item, the cookie
must be put @emph{before} the checkbox.  If you have activated alphabetical
lists, you can also use counters like @code{[@@b]}.}.  Those constructs can
be used in any item of the list in order to enforce a particular numbering.
@item
@emph{Description} list items are unordered list items, and contain the
separator @samp{ :: } to distinguish the description @emph{term} from the
description.
@end itemize

Items belonging to the same list must have the same indentation on the first
line.  In particular, if an ordered list reaches number @samp{10.}, then the
2--digit numbers must be written left-aligned with the other numbers in the
list.  An item ends before the next line that is less or equally indented
than its bullet/number.

@vindex org-list-empty-line-terminates-plain-lists
A list ends whenever every item has ended, which means before any line less
or equally indented than items at top level.  It also ends before two blank
lines@footnote{See also @code{org-list-empty-line-terminates-plain-lists}.}.
In that case, all items are closed.  Here is an example:

@example
@group
** Lord of the Rings
   My favorite scenes are (in this order)
   1. The attack of the Rohirrim
   2. Eowyn's fight with the witch king
      + this was already my favorite scene in the book
      + I really like Miranda Otto.
   3. Peter Jackson being shot by Legolas
      - on DVD only
      He makes a really funny face when it happens.
   But in the end, no individual scenes matter but the film as a whole.
   Important actors in this film are:
   - @b{Elijah Wood} :: He plays Frodo
   - @b{Sean Austin} :: He plays Sam, Frodo's friend.  I still remember
     him very well from his role as Mikey Walsh in @i{The Goonies}.
@end group
@end example

Org supports these lists by tuning filling and wrapping commands to deal with
them correctly@footnote{Org only changes the filling settings for Emacs.  For
XEmacs, you should use Kyle E. Jones' @file{filladapt.el}.  To turn this on,
put into @file{.emacs}: @code{(require 'filladapt)}}, and by exporting them
properly (@pxref{Exporting}).  Since indentation is what governs the
structure of these lists, many structural constructs like @code{#+BEGIN_...}
blocks can be indented to signal that they belong to a particular item.

@vindex org-list-demote-modify-bullet
@vindex org-list-indent-offset
If you find that using a different bullet for a sub-list (than that used for
the current list-level) improves readability, customize the variable
@code{org-list-demote-modify-bullet}.  To get a greater difference of
indentation between items and theirs sub-items, customize
@code{org-list-indent-offset}.

@vindex org-list-automatic-rules
The following commands act on items when the cursor is in the first line of
an item (the line with the bullet or number).  Some of them imply the
application of automatic rules to keep list structure intact.  If some of
these actions get in your way, configure @code{org-list-automatic-rules}
to disable them individually.

@table @asis
@orgcmd{@key{TAB},org-cycle}
@cindex cycling, in plain lists
@vindex org-cycle-include-plain-lists
Items can be folded just like headline levels.  Normally this works only if
the cursor is on a plain list item.  For more details, see the variable
@code{org-cycle-include-plain-lists}.  If this variable is set to
@code{integrate}, plain list items will be treated like low-level
headlines.  The level of an item is then given by the indentation of the
bullet/number.  Items are always subordinate to real headlines, however; the
hierarchies remain completely separated.  In a new item with no text yet, the
first @key{TAB} demotes the item to become a child of the previous
one.  Subsequent @key{TAB}s move the item to meaningful levels in the list
and eventually get it back to its initial position.
@orgcmd{M-@key{RET},org-insert-heading}
@vindex org-M-RET-may-split-line
@vindex org-list-automatic-rules
Insert new item at current level.  With a prefix argument, force a new
heading (@pxref{Structure editing}).  If this command is used in the middle
of an item, that item is @emph{split} in two, and the second part becomes the
new item@footnote{If you do not want the item to be split, customize the
variable @code{org-M-RET-may-split-line}.}.  If this command is executed
@emph{before item's body}, the new item is created @emph{before} the current
one.
@end table

@table @kbd
@kindex M-S-@key{RET}
@item M-S-@key{RET}
Insert a new item with a checkbox (@pxref{Checkboxes}).
@kindex S-@key{down}
@item S-up
@itemx S-down
@cindex shift-selection-mode
@vindex org-support-shift-select
@vindex org-list-use-circular-motion
Jump to the previous/next item in the current list@footnote{If you want to
cycle around items that way, you may customize
@code{org-list-use-circular-motion}.}, but only if
@code{org-support-shift-select} is off.  If not, you can still use paragraph
jumping commands like @kbd{C-@key{up}} and @kbd{C-@key{down}} to quite
similar effect.
@kindex M-@key{up}
@kindex M-@key{down}
@item M-up
@itemx M-down
Move the item including subitems up/down@footnote{See
@code{org-list-use-circular-motion} for a cyclic behavior.} (swap with
previous/next item of same indentation).  If the list is ordered, renumbering
is automatic.
@kindex M-@key{left}
@kindex M-@key{right}
@item M-left
@itemx M-right
Decrease/increase the indentation of an item, leaving children alone.
@kindex M-S-@key{left}
@kindex M-S-@key{right}
@item M-S-@key{left}
@itemx M-S-@key{right}
Decrease/increase the indentation of the item, including subitems.
Initially, the item tree is selected based on current indentation.  When
these commands are executed several times in direct succession, the initially
selected region is used, even if the new indentation would imply a different
hierarchy.  To use the new hierarchy, break the command chain with a cursor
motion or so.

As a special case, using this command on the very first item of a list will
move the whole list.  This behavior can be disabled by configuring
@code{org-list-automatic-rules}.  The global indentation of a list has no
influence on the text @emph{after} the list.
@kindex C-c C-c
@item C-c C-c
If there is a checkbox (@pxref{Checkboxes}) in the item line, toggle the
state of the checkbox.  In any case, verify bullets and indentation
consistency in the whole list.
@kindex C-c -
@vindex org-plain-list-ordered-item-terminator
@item C-c -
Cycle the entire list level through the different itemize/enumerate bullets
(@samp{-}, @samp{+}, @samp{*}, @samp{1.}, @samp{1)}) or a subset of them,
depending on @code{org-plain-list-ordered-item-terminator}, the type of list,
and its indentation.  With a numeric prefix argument N, select the Nth bullet
from this list.  If there is an active region when calling this, selected
text will be changed into an item.  With a prefix argument, all lines will be
converted to list items.  If the first line already was a list item, any item
marker will be removed from the list.  Finally, even without an active
region, a normal line will be converted into a list item.
@kindex C-c *
@item C-c *
Turn a plain list item into a headline (so that it becomes a subheading at
its location).  @xref{Structure editing}, for a detailed explanation.
@kindex C-c C-*
@item C-c C-*
Turn the whole plain list into a subtree of the current heading.  Checkboxes
(@pxref{Checkboxes}) will become TODO (resp. DONE) keywords when unchecked
(resp. checked).
@kindex S-@key{left}
@kindex S-@key{right}
@item S-left/right
@vindex org-support-shift-select
This command also cycles bullet styles when the cursor in on the bullet or
anywhere in an item line, details depending on
@code{org-support-shift-select}.
@kindex C-c ^
@cindex sorting, of plain list
@item C-c ^
Sort the plain list.  You will be prompted for the sorting method:
numerically, alphabetically, by time, by checked status for check lists,
or by a custom function.

@vindex org-drawers
@cindex org-insert-drawer
@kindex C-c C-x d
Sometimes you want to keep information associated with an entry, but you
normally don't want to see it.  For this, Org mode has @emph{drawers}.
Drawers need to be configured with the option @code{org-drawers}@footnote{You
can define additional drawers on a per-file basis with a line like
@code{#+DRAWERS: HIDDEN STATE}}.  Drawers look like this:

@example
** This is a headline
   Still outside the drawer
   :DRAWERNAME:
   This is inside the drawer.
   :END:
   After the drawer.
@end example

You can interactively insert drawers at point by calling
@code{org-insert-drawer}, which is bound to @key{C-c C-x d}.  With an active
region, this command will put the region inside the drawer.  With a prefix
argument, this command calls @code{org-insert-property-drawer} and add a
property drawer right below the current headline.  Completion over drawer
keywords is also possible using @key{M-TAB}.

Visibility cycling (@pxref{Visibility cycling}) on the headline will hide and
show the entry, but keep the drawer collapsed to a single line.  In order to
look inside the drawer, you need to move the cursor to the drawer line and
press @key{TAB} there.  Org mode uses the @code{PROPERTIES} drawer for
storing properties (@pxref{Properties and Columns}), and you can also arrange
for state change notes (@pxref{Tracking TODO state changes}) and clock times
(@pxref{Clocking work time}) to be stored in a drawer @code{LOGBOOK}.  If you
want to store a quick note in the LOGBOOK drawer, in a similar way to state changes, use

@table @kbd
@kindex C-c C-z
@item C-c C-z
Add a time-stamped note to the LOGBOOK drawer.
@end table

@vindex org-export-with-drawers
You can select the name of the drawers which should be exported with
@code{org-export-with-drawers}.  In that case, drawer contents will appear in
export output.  Property drawers are not affected by this variable and are
never exported.

Org mode uses begin...end blocks for various purposes from including source

information (@pxref{Clocking work time}).  These blocks can be folded and
unfolded by pressing TAB in the begin line.  You can also get all blocks
folded at startup by configuring the option @code{org-hide-block-startup}
or on a per-file basis by using

@node Footnotes, Orgstruct mode, Blocks, Document Structure
@section Footnotes
@cindex footnotes

Org mode supports the creation of footnotes.  In contrast to the
@file{footnote.el} package, Org mode's footnotes are designed for work on
a larger document, not only for one-off documents like emails.

A footnote is started by a footnote marker in square brackets in column 0, no
indentation allowed.  It ends at the next footnote definition, headline, or
after two consecutive empty lines.  The footnote reference is simply the
marker in square brackets, inside text.  For example:

@example
The Org homepage[fn:1] now looks a lot better than it used to.
...
[fn:1] The link is: http://orgmode.org
@end example

Org mode extends the number-based syntax to @emph{named} footnotes and
optional inline definition.  Using plain numbers as markers (as
@file{footnote.el} does) is supported for backward compatibility, but not
encouraged because of possible conflicts with @LaTeX{} snippets (@pxref{Embedded
@LaTeX{}}).  Here are the valid references:

@table @code
@item [1]
A plain numeric footnote marker.  Compatible with @file{footnote.el}, but not
recommended because something like @samp{[1]} could easily be part of a code
snippet.
@item [fn:name]
A named footnote reference, where @code{name} is a unique label word, or, for
simplicity of automatic creation, a number.
@item [fn:: This is the inline definition of this footnote]
A @LaTeX{}-like anonymous footnote where the definition is given directly at the
reference point.
@item [fn:name: a definition]
An inline definition of a footnote, which also specifies a name for the note.
Since Org allows multiple references to the same note, you can then use
@code{[fn:name]} to create additional references.
@end table

@vindex org-footnote-auto-label
Footnote labels can be created automatically, or you can create names yourself.
This is handled by the variable @code{org-footnote-auto-label} and its
corresponding @code{#+STARTUP} keywords.  See the docstring of that variable
for details.

@noindent The following command handles footnotes:

@table @kbd
@kindex C-c C-x f
@item C-c C-x f
The footnote action command.

When the cursor is on a footnote reference, jump to the definition.  When it
is at a definition, jump to the (first) reference.

@vindex org-footnote-define-inline
@vindex org-footnote-section
@vindex org-footnote-auto-adjust
Otherwise, create a new footnote.  Depending on the option
@code{org-footnote-define-inline}@footnote{The corresponding in-buffer
setting is: @code{#+STARTUP: fninline} or @code{#+STARTUP: nofninline}}, the
definition will be placed right into the text as part of the reference, or
separately into the location determined by the option
@code{org-footnote-section}.

When this command is called with a prefix argument, a menu of additional
options is offered:
@example
s   @r{Sort the footnote definitions by reference sequence.  During editing,}
    @r{Org makes no effort to sort footnote definitions into a particular}
    @r{sequence.  If you want them sorted, use this command, which will}
    @r{also move entries according to @code{org-footnote-section}.  Automatic}
    @r{sorting after each insertion/deletion can be configured using the}
    @r{option @code{org-footnote-auto-adjust}.}
r   @r{Renumber the simple @code{fn:N} footnotes.  Automatic renumbering}
    @r{after each insertion/deletion can be configured using the option}
    @r{@code{org-footnote-auto-adjust}.}
S   @r{Short for first @code{r}, then @code{s} action.}
n   @r{Normalize the footnotes by collecting all definitions (including}
    @r{inline definitions) into a special section, and then numbering them}
    @r{in sequence.  The references will then also be numbers.  This is}
    @r{meant to be the final step before finishing a document (e.g., sending}
    @r{off an email).}
d   @r{Delete the footnote at point, and all definitions of and references}
    @r{to it.}
@end example
Depending on the variable @code{org-footnote-auto-adjust}@footnote{the
corresponding in-buffer options are @code{fnadjust} and @code{nofnadjust}.},
renumbering and sorting footnotes can be automatic after each insertion or
deletion.

@kindex C-c C-c
@item C-c C-c
If the cursor is on a footnote reference, jump to the definition.  If it is a
the definition, jump back to the reference.  When called at a footnote
location with a prefix argument, offer the same menu as @kbd{C-c C-x f}.
@kindex C-c C-o
@kindex mouse-1
@kindex mouse-2
@item C-c C-o  @r{or} mouse-1/2
Footnote labels are also links to the corresponding definition/reference, and
you can use the usual commands to follow these links.

@section The Orgstruct minor mode
@cindex Orgstruct mode
@cindex minor mode for structure editing

If you like the intuitive way the Org mode structure editing and list
formatting works, you might want to use these commands in other modes like
Text mode or Mail mode as well.  The minor mode @code{orgstruct-mode} makes
this possible.   Toggle the mode with @kbd{M-x orgstruct-mode RET}, or
turn it on by default, for example in Message mode, with one of:

@lisp
(add-hook 'message-mode-hook 'turn-on-orgstruct)
(add-hook 'message-mode-hook 'turn-on-orgstruct++)
@end lisp

When this mode is active and the cursor is on a line that looks to Org like a
headline or the first line of a list item, most structure editing commands
will work, even if the same keys normally have different functionality in the
major mode you are using.  If the cursor is not in one of those special
lines, Orgstruct mode lurks silently in the shadows.

When you use @code{orgstruct++-mode}, Org will also export indentation and
autofill settings into that mode, and detect item context after the first
line of an item.

@vindex orgstruct-heading-prefix-regexp
You can also use Org structure editing to fold and unfold headlines in
@emph{any} file, provided you defined @code{orgstruct-heading-prefix-regexp}:
the regular expression must match the local prefix to use before Org's
headlines.  For example, if you set this variable to @code{";; "} in Emacs
Lisp files, you will be able to fold and unfold headlines in Emacs Lisp
commented lines.  Some commands like @code{org-demote} are disabled when the
prefix is set, but folding/unfolding will work correctly.

@node Org syntax,  , Orgstruct mode, Document Structure
@section Org syntax
@cindex Org syntax

A reference document providing a formal description of Org's syntax is
available as @uref{http://orgmode.org/worg/dev/org-syntax.html, a draft on
Worg}, written and maintained by Nicolas Goaziou.  It defines Org's core
internal concepts such as @code{headlines}, @code{sections}, @code{affiliated
keywords}, @code{(greater) elements} and @code{objects}.  Each part of an Org
file falls into one of the categories above.

To explore the abstract structure of an Org buffer, run this in a buffer:

@lisp
M-: (org-element-parse-buffer) RET
@end lisp

It will output a list containing the buffer's content represented as an
abstract structure.  The export engine relies on the information stored in
this list.  Most interactive commands (e.g., for structure editing) also
rely on the syntactic meaning of the surrounding context.

@node Built-in table editor, Column width and alignment, Tables, Tables
@section The built-in table editor
@cindex table editor, built-in

Org makes it easy to format tables in plain ASCII@.  Any line with @samp{|} as
the first non-whitespace character is considered part of a table.  @samp{|}
is also the column separator@footnote{To insert a vertical bar into a table
field, use @code{\vert} or, inside a word @code{abc\vert@{@}def}.}.  A table
might look like this:

@example
| Name  | Phone | Age |
|-------+-------+-----|
| Peter |  1234 |  17 |
| Anna  |  4321 |  25 |
@end example

A table is re-aligned automatically each time you press @key{TAB} or
@key{RET} or @kbd{C-c C-c} inside the table.  @key{TAB} also moves to
the next field (@key{RET} to the next row) and creates new table rows
at the end of the table or before horizontal lines.  The indentation
of the table is set by the first line.  Any line starting with
@samp{|-} is considered as a horizontal separator line and will be
expanded on the next re-align to span the whole table width.  So, to
create the above table, you would only type

@example
|Name|Phone|Age|
|-
@end example

@noindent and then press @key{TAB} to align the table and start filling in
fields.  Even faster would be to type @code{|Name|Phone|Age} followed by
@kbd{C-c @key{RET}}.

@vindex org-enable-table-editor
@vindex org-table-auto-blank-field
When typing text into a field, Org treats @key{DEL},
@key{Backspace}, and all character keys in a special way, so that
inserting and deleting avoids shifting other fields.  Also, when
typing @emph{immediately after the cursor was moved into a new field
with @kbd{@key{TAB}}, @kbd{S-@key{TAB}} or @kbd{@key{RET}}}, the
field is automatically made blank.  If this behavior is too
unpredictable for you, configure the options
@code{org-enable-table-editor} and @code{org-table-auto-blank-field}.

@table @kbd
@tsubheading{Creation and conversion}
@orgcmd{C-c |,org-table-create-or-convert-from-region}
Convert the active region to table.  If every line contains at least one
TAB character, the function assumes that the material is tab separated.
If every line contains a comma, comma-separated values (CSV) are assumed.
If not, lines are split at whitespace into fields.  You can use a prefix
argument to force a specific separator: @kbd{C-u} forces CSV, @kbd{C-u
C-u} forces TAB, and a numeric argument N indicates that at least N
consecutive spaces, or alternatively a TAB will be the separator.
@*
If there is no active region, this command creates an empty Org
table.  But it is easier just to start typing, like
@kbd{|Name|Phone|Age @key{RET} |- @key{TAB}}.

@tsubheading{Re-aligning and field motion}
@orgcmd{C-c C-c,org-table-align}
Re-align the table and don't move to another field.
@c
@orgcmd{<TAB>,org-table-next-field}
Re-align the table, move to the next field.  Creates a new row if
necessary.
@c
@orgcmd{S-@key{TAB},org-table-previous-field}
Re-align, move to previous field.
@c
@orgcmd{@key{RET},org-table-next-row}
Re-align the table and move down to next row.  Creates a new row if
necessary.  At the beginning or end of a line, @key{RET} still does
NEWLINE, so it can be used to split a table.
@c
@orgcmd{M-a,org-table-beginning-of-field}
Move to beginning of the current table field, or on to the previous field.
@orgcmd{M-e,org-table-end-of-field}
Move to end of the current table field, or on to the next field.

@tsubheading{Column and row editing}
@orgcmdkkcc{M-@key{left},M-@key{right},org-table-move-column-left,org-table-move-column-right}
Move the current column left/right.
@c

Kill the current column.
@c
@orgcmd{M-S-@key{right},org-table-insert-column}
Insert a new column to the left of the cursor position.
@c
@orgcmdkkcc{M-@key{up},M-@key{down},org-table-move-row-up,org-table-move-row-down}
Move the current row up/down.
@c
@orgcmd{M-S-@key{up},org-table-kill-row}
Kill the current row or horizontal line.
@c
@orgcmd{M-S-@key{down},org-table-insert-row}
Insert a new row above the current row.  With a prefix argument, the line is
created below the current one.
@c
@orgcmd{C-c -,org-table-insert-hline}
Insert a horizontal line below current row.  With a prefix argument, the line
is created above the current line.
@c
@orgcmd{C-c @key{RET},org-table-hline-and-move}
Insert a horizontal line below current row, and move the cursor into the row
below that line.
@c
@orgcmd{C-c ^,org-table-sort-lines}
Sort the table lines in the region.  The position of point indicates the
column to be used for sorting, and the range of lines is the range
between the nearest horizontal separator lines, or the entire table.  If
point is before the first column, you will be prompted for the sorting
column.  If there is an active region, the mark specifies the first line
and the sorting column, while point should be in the last line to be
included into the sorting.  The command prompts for the sorting type
(alphabetically, numerically, or by time).  When called with a prefix
argument, alphabetic sorting will be case-sensitive.

@tsubheading{Regions}
@orgcmd{C-c C-x M-w,org-table-copy-region}
Copy a rectangular region from a table to a special clipboard.  Point and
mark determine edge fields of the rectangle.  If there is no active region,
copy just the current field.  The process ignores horizontal separator lines.
@c
@orgcmd{C-c C-x C-w,org-table-cut-region}
Copy a rectangular region from a table to a special clipboard, and
blank all fields in the rectangle.  So this is the ``cut'' operation.
@c
@orgcmd{C-c C-x C-y,org-table-paste-rectangle}
Paste a rectangular region into a table.
The upper left corner ends up in the current field.  All involved fields
will be overwritten.  If the rectangle does not fit into the present table,
the table is enlarged as needed.  The process ignores horizontal separator
lines.
@c
@orgcmd{M-@key{RET},org-table-wrap-region}
Split the current field at the cursor position and move the rest to the line
below.  If there is an active region, and both point and mark are in the same
column, the text in the column is wrapped to minimum width for the given
number of lines.  A numeric prefix argument may be used to change the number
of desired lines.  If there is no region, but you specify a prefix argument,
the current field is made blank, and the content is appended to the field
above.

@cindex formula, in tables
@cindex calculations, in tables
@cindex region, active

the active region.  The result is shown in the echo area and can
be inserted with @kbd{C-y}.
@c
@orgcmd{S-@key{RET},org-table-copy-down}
@vindex org-table-copy-increment
When current field is empty, copy from first non-empty field above.  When not
empty, copy current field down to next row and move cursor along with it.
Depending on the option @code{org-table-copy-increment}, integer field
values will be incremented during copy.  Integers that are too large will not
be incremented.  Also, a @code{0} prefix argument temporarily disables the
increment.  This key is also used by shift-selection and related modes
(@pxref{Conflicts}).

@tsubheading{Miscellaneous}
@orgcmd{C-c `,org-table-edit-field}
Edit the current field in a separate window.  This is useful for fields that
are not fully visible (@pxref{Column width and alignment}).  When called with
a @kbd{C-u} prefix, just make the full field visible, so that it can be
edited in place.  When called with two @kbd{C-u} prefixes, make the editor
window follow the cursor through the table and always show the current
field.  The follow mode exits automatically when the cursor leaves the table,
or when you repeat this command with @kbd{C-u C-u C-c `}.
@c
@item M-x org-table-import RET
Import a file as a table.  The table should be TAB or whitespace
separated.  Use, for example, to import a spreadsheet table or data
from a database, because these programs generally can write
TAB-separated text files.  This command works by inserting the file into
the buffer and then converting the region to a table.  Any prefix
argument is passed on to the converter, which uses it to determine the
separator.
@orgcmd{C-c |,org-table-create-or-convert-from-region}
Tables can also be imported by pasting tabular text into the Org
buffer, selecting the pasted text with @kbd{C-x C-x} and then using the
@kbd{C-c |} command (see above under @i{Creation and conversion}).
@c
@item M-x org-table-export RET
@findex org-table-export
@vindex org-table-export-default-format
Export the table, by default as a TAB-separated file.  Use for data
exchange with, for example, spreadsheet or database programs.  The format
used to export the file can be configured in the option
@code{org-table-export-default-format}.  You may also use properties
@code{TABLE_EXPORT_FILE} and @code{TABLE_EXPORT_FORMAT} to specify the file
name and the format for table export in a subtree.  Org supports quite
general formats for exported tables.  The exporter format is the same as the
format used by Orgtbl radio tables, see @ref{Translator functions}, for a
detailed description.
@end table

If you don't like the automatic table editor because it gets in your
way on lines which you would like to start with @samp{|}, you can turn
it off with

@lisp
(setq org-enable-table-editor nil)
@end lisp

@noindent Then the only table command that still works is
@kbd{C-c C-c} to do a manual re-align.

@node Column width and alignment, Column groups, Built-in table editor, Tables
@section Column width and alignment
@cindex narrow columns in tables
@cindex alignment in tables

The width of columns is automatically determined by the table editor.  And
also the alignment of a column is determined automatically from the fraction
of number-like versus non-number fields in the column.

Sometimes a single field or a few fields need to carry more text, leading to
inconveniently wide columns.  Or maybe you want to make a table with several
columns having a fixed width, regardless of content.  To set@footnote{This
feature does not work on XEmacs.} the width of a column, one field anywhere
in the column may contain just the string @samp{<N>} where @samp{N} is an
integer specifying the width of the column in characters.  The next re-align
will then set the width of this column to this value.

@example
@group
|---+------------------------------|               |---+--------|
|   |                              |               |   | <6>    |
| 1 | one                          |               | 1 | one    |
| 2 | two                          |     ----\     | 2 | two    |
| 3 | This is a long chunk of text |     ----/     | 3 | This=> |
| 4 | four                         |               | 4 | four   |
|---+------------------------------|               |---+--------|
@end group
@end example

@noindent
Fields that are wider become clipped and end in the string @samp{=>}.
Note that the full text is still in the buffer but is hidden.
To see the full text, hold the mouse over the field---a tool-tip window
will show the full content.  To edit such a field, use the command
@kbd{C-c `} (that is @kbd{C-c} followed by the grave accent).  This will
open a new window with the full field.  Edit it and finish with @kbd{C-c
C-c}.

@vindex org-startup-align-all-tables
When visiting a file containing a table with narrowed columns, the
necessary character hiding has not yet happened, and the table needs to
be aligned before it looks nice.  Setting the option
@code{org-startup-align-all-tables} will realign all tables in a file
upon visiting, but also slow down startup.  You can also set this option
on a per-file basis with:

@example
#+STARTUP: align
#+STARTUP: noalign
@end example

If you would like to overrule the automatic alignment of number-rich columns
to the right and of string-rich column to the left, you can use @samp{<r>},
@samp{<c>}@footnote{Centering does not work inside Emacs, but it does have an
effect when exporting to HTML.} or @samp{<l>} in a similar fashion.  You may
also combine alignment and field width like this: @samp{<r10>}.

Lines which only contain these formatting cookies will be removed
automatically when exporting the document.

@node Column groups, Orgtbl mode, Column width and alignment, Tables
@section Column groups
@cindex grouping columns in tables

When Org exports tables, it does so by default without vertical
lines because that is visually more satisfying in general.  Occasionally
however, vertical lines can be useful to structure a table into groups
of columns, much like horizontal lines can do for groups of rows.  In
order to specify column groups, you can use a special row where the
first field contains only @samp{/}.  The further fields can either
contain @samp{<} to indicate that this column should start a group,
@samp{>} to indicate the end of a column, or @samp{<>} (no space between @samp{<}
and @samp{>}) to make a column
a group of its own.  Boundaries between column groups will upon export be
marked with vertical lines.  Here is an example:

@example
| N | N^2 | N^3 | N^4 | sqrt(n) | sqrt[4](N) |
|---+-----+-----+-----+---------+------------|
| / |   < |     |   > |       < |          > |
| 1 |   1 |   1 |   1 |       1 |          1 |
| 2 |   4 |   8 |  16 |  1.4142 |     1.1892 |

If you like the intuitive way the Org table editor works, you
might also want to use it in other modes like Text mode or Mail mode.
The minor mode Orgtbl mode makes this possible.  You can always toggle
the mode with @kbd{M-x orgtbl-mode RET}.  To turn it on by default, for
example in Message mode, use

@lisp
(add-hook 'message-mode-hook 'turn-on-orgtbl)
@end lisp

Furthermore, with some special setup, it is possible to maintain tables
in arbitrary syntax with Orgtbl mode.  For example, it is possible to
construct @LaTeX{} tables with the underlying ease and power of
Orgtbl mode, including spreadsheet capabilities.  For details, see
@ref{Tables in arbitrary syntax}.

The table editor makes use of the Emacs @file{calc} package to implement
spreadsheet-like capabilities.  It can also evaluate Emacs Lisp forms to
derive fields from other fields.  While fully featured, Org's implementation
is not identical to other spreadsheets.  For example, Org knows the concept
of a @emph{column formula} that will be applied to all non-header fields in a
column without having to copy the formula to each relevant field.  There is
also a formula debugger, and a formula editor with features for highlighting
fields in the table corresponding to the references at the point in the
formula, moving these references by arrow keys

@subsection References
@cindex references

To compute fields in the table from other fields, formulas must
reference other fields or ranges.  In Org, fields can be referenced
by name, by absolute coordinates, and by relative coordinates.  To find
out what the coordinates of a field are, press @kbd{C-c ?} in that
field, or press @kbd{C-c @}} to toggle the display of a grid.

@subsubheading Field references
@cindex field references
@cindex references, to fields

Formulas can reference the value of another field in two ways.  Like in
any other spreadsheet, you may reference fields with a letter/number
combination like @code{B3}, meaning the 2nd field in the 3rd row.
@vindex org-table-use-standard-references
However, Org prefers@footnote{Org will understand references typed by the
user as @samp{B4}, but it will not use this syntax when offering a formula
for editing.  You can customize this behavior using the option
@code{org-table-use-standard-references}.} to use another, more general
representation that looks like this:
@example
@@@var{row}$@var{column}
@end example

Column specifications can be absolute like @code{$1},
@code{$2},...@code{$@var{N}}, or relative to the current column (i.e., the
column of the field which is being computed) like @code{$+1} or @code{$-2}.
@code{$<} and @code{$>} are immutable references to the first and last
column, respectively, and you can use @code{$>>>} to indicate the third
column from the right.

The row specification only counts data lines and ignores horizontal separator
lines (hlines).  Like with columns, you can use absolute row numbers
@code{@@1}, @code{@@2},...@code{@@@var{N}}, and row numbers relative to the
current row like @code{@@+3} or @code{@@-1}.  @code{@@<} and @code{@@>} are
immutable references the first and last@footnote{For backward compatibility
you can also use special names like @code{$LR5} and @code{$LR12} to refer in
a stable way to the 5th and 12th field in the last row of the table.
However, this syntax is deprecated, it should not be used for new documents.
Use @code{@@>$} instead.} row in the table, respectively.  You may also
specify the row relative to one of the hlines: @code{@@I} refers to the first
hline, @code{@@II} to the second, etc.  @code{@@-I} refers to the first such
line above the current line, @code{@@+I} to the first such line below the
current line.  You can also write @code{@@III+2} which is the second data line
after the third hline in the table.

@code{@@0} and @code{$0} refer to the current row and column, respectively,
i.e., to the row/column for the field being computed.  Also, if you omit
either the column or the row part of the reference, the current row/column is
implied.

Org's references with @emph{unsigned} numbers are fixed references
in the sense that if you use the same reference in the formula for two
different fields, the same field will be referenced each time.
Org's references with @emph{signed} numbers are floating
references because the same reference operator can reference different
fields depending on the field being calculated by the formula.

Here are a few examples:

@example
@@2$3      @r{2nd row, 3rd column (same as @code{C2})}
$5        @r{column 5 in the current row (same as @code{E&})}
@@2        @r{current column, row 2}
@@-1$-3    @r{the field one row up, three columns to the left}
@@-I$2     @r{field just under hline above current row, column 2}
@@>$5      @r{field in the last row, in column 5}
@end example

@subsubheading Range references
@cindex range references
@cindex references, to ranges

You may reference a rectangular range of fields by specifying two field
references connected by two dots @samp{..}.  If both fields are in the
current row, you may simply use @samp{$2..$7}, but if at least one field
is in a different row, you need to use the general @code{@@row$column}
format at least for the first field (i.e the reference must start with
@samp{@@} in order to be interpreted correctly).  Examples:

@example
$1..$3        @r{first three fields in the current row}
$P..$Q        @r{range, using column names (see under Advanced)}
$<<<..$>>     @r{start in third column, continue to the one but last}
@@2$1..@@4$3    @r{6 fields between these two fields (same as @code{A2..C4})}
@@-1$-2..@@-1   @r{3 fields in the row above, starting from 2 columns on the left}
@@I..II        @r{between first and second hline, short for @code{@@I..@@II}}
@end example

@noindent Range references return a vector of values that can be fed
into Calc vector functions.  Empty fields in ranges are normally suppressed,
so that the vector contains only the non-empty fields.  For other options
with the mode switches @samp{E}, @samp{N} and examples @pxref{Formula syntax
for Calc}.

@subsubheading Field coordinates in formulas
@cindex field coordinates
@cindex coordinates, of field
@cindex row, of field coordinates
@cindex column, of field coordinates

For Calc formulas and Lisp formulas @code{@@#} and @code{$#} can be used to
get the row or column number of the field where the formula result goes.
The traditional Lisp formula equivalents are @code{org-table-current-dline}
and @code{org-table-current-column}.  Examples:

@example
if(@@# % 2, $#, string(""))   @r{column number on odd lines only}
$3 = remote(FOO, @@@@#$2)      @r{copy column 2 from table FOO into}
                             @r{column 3 of the current table}
@end example

@noindent For the second example, table FOO must have at least as many rows
as the current table.  Note that this is inefficient@footnote{The computation time scales as
O(N^2) because table FOO is parsed for each field to be copied.} for large
number of rows.

@subsubheading Named references
@cindex named references
@cindex references, named
@cindex name, of column or field
@cindex constants, in calculations
@cindex #+CONSTANTS

@vindex org-table-formula-constants
@samp{$name} is interpreted as the name of a column, parameter or
constant.  Constants are defined globally through the option
@code{org-table-formula-constants}, and locally (for the file) through a
line like

@example
#+CONSTANTS: c=299792458. pi=3.14 eps=2.4e-6
@end example

@noindent
@vindex constants-unit-system
@pindex constants.el
Also properties (@pxref{Properties and Columns}) can be used as
constants in table formulas: for a property @samp{:Xyz:} use the name
@samp{$PROP_Xyz}, and the property will be searched in the current
outline entry and in the hierarchy above it.  If you have the
@file{constants.el} package, it will also be used to resolve constants,
including natural constants like @samp{$h} for Planck's constant, and
units like @samp{$km} for kilometers@footnote{@file{constants.el} can
supply the values of constants in two different unit systems, @code{SI}
and @code{cgs}.  Which one is used depends on the value of the variable
@code{constants-unit-system}.  You can use the @code{#+STARTUP} options
@code{constSI} and @code{constcgs} to set this value for the current
buffer.}.  Column names and parameters can be specified in special table
lines.  These are described below, see @ref{Advanced features}.  All
names must start with a letter, and further consist of letters and
numbers.

@subsubheading Remote references
@cindex remote references
@cindex references, remote

You may also reference constants, fields and ranges from a different table,
either in the current file or even in a different file.  The syntax is

@example
remote(NAME-OR-ID,REF)
@end example

@noindent
where NAME can be the name of a table in the current file as set by a
@code{#+NAME: Name} line before the table.  It can also be the ID of an
entry, even in a different file, and the reference then refers to the first
table in that entry.  REF is an absolute field or range reference as
described above for example @code{@@3$3} or @code{$somename}, valid in the
referenced table.

@node Formula syntax for Calc, Formula syntax for Lisp, References, The spreadsheet
@subsection Formula syntax for Calc
@cindex formula syntax, Calc
@cindex syntax, of formulas

A formula can be any algebraic expression understood by the Emacs @file{Calc}
package.  Note that @file{calc} has the non-standard convention that @samp{/}
has lower precedence than @samp{*}, so that @samp{a/b*c} is interpreted as
@samp{a/(b*c)}.  Before evaluation by @code{calc-eval} (@pxref{Calling Calc
from Your Programs, calc-eval, Calling Calc from Your Lisp Programs, calc,
GNU Emacs Calc Manual}), variable substitution takes place according to the
rules described above.
@cindex vectors, in table calculations
The range vectors can be directly fed into the Calc vector functions
like @samp{vmean} and @samp{vsum}.

@cindex format specifier
@cindex mode, for @file{calc}
@vindex org-calc-default-modes
A formula can contain an optional mode string after a semicolon.  This
string consists of flags to influence Calc and other modes during
execution.  By default, Org uses the standard Calc modes (precision
12, angular units degrees, fraction and symbolic modes off).  The display
format, however, has been changed to @code{(float 8)} to keep tables
compact.  The default settings can be configured using the option
@code{org-calc-default-modes}.

@noindent List of modes:

@table @asis
@item @code{p20}
Set the internal Calc calculation precision to 20 digits.
@item @code{n3}, @code{s3}, @code{e2}, @code{f4}
Normal, scientific, engineering or fixed format of the result of Calc passed
back to Org.  Calc formatting is unlimited in precision as long as the Calc
calculation precision is greater.
@item @code{D}, @code{R}
Degree and radian angle modes of Calc.
@item @code{F}, @code{S}
Fraction and symbolic modes of Calc.
@item @code{T}, @code{t}
Duration computations in Calc or Lisp, @pxref{Durations and time values}.
@item @code{E}
If and how to consider empty fields.  Without @samp{E} empty fields in range
references are suppressed so that the Calc vector or Lisp list contains only
the non-empty fields.  With @samp{E} the empty fields are kept.  For empty
fields in ranges or empty field references the value @samp{nan} (not a
number) is used in Calc formulas and the empty string is used for Lisp
formulas.  Add @samp{N} to use 0 instead for both formula types.  For the
value of a field the mode @samp{N} has higher precedence than @samp{E}.
@item @code{N}
Interpret all fields as numbers, use 0 for non-numbers.  See the next section
to see how this is essential for computations with Lisp formulas.  In Calc
formulas it is used only occasionally because there number strings are
already interpreted as numbers without @samp{N}.
@item @code{L}
Literal, for Lisp formulas only.  See the next section.
@end table

@noindent
Unless you use large integer numbers or high-precision-calculation and
-display for floating point numbers you may alternatively provide a
@samp{printf} format specifier to reformat the Calc result after it has been
passed back to Org instead of letting Calc already do the
formatting@footnote{The @samp{printf} reformatting is limited in precision
because the value passed to it is converted into an @samp{integer} or
@samp{double}.  The @samp{integer} is limited in size by truncating the
signed value to 32 bits.  The @samp{double} is limited in precision to 64
bits overall which leaves approximately 16 significant decimal digits.}.  A
few examples:

@example
$1+$2                @r{Sum of first and second field}
$1+$2;%.2f           @r{Same, format result to two decimals}
exp($2)+exp($1)      @r{Math functions can be used}
$0;%.1f              @r{Reformat current cell to 1 decimal}
($3-32)*5/9          @r{Degrees F -> C conversion}
$c/$1/$cm            @r{Hz -> cm conversion, using @file{constants.el}}
tan($1);Dp3s1        @r{Compute in degrees, precision 3, display SCI 1}
sin($1);Dp3%.1e      @r{Same, but use printf specifier for display}
taylor($3,x=7,2)     @r{Taylor series of $3, at x=7, second degree}
@end example

Calc also contains a complete set of logical operations, (@pxref{Logical
Operations, , Logical Operations, calc, GNU Emacs Calc Manual}).  For example

@table @code
@item if($1 < 20, teen, string(""))
"teen" if age $1 is less than 20, else the Org table result field is set to
empty with the empty string.
@item if("$1" == "nan" || "$2" == "nan", string(""), $1 + $2); E f-1
Sum of the first two columns.  When at least one of the input fields is empty
the Org table result field is set to empty.  @samp{E} is required to not
convert empty fields to 0.  @samp{f-1} is an optional Calc format string
similar to @samp{%.1f} but leaves empty results empty.
@item if(typeof(vmean($1..$7)) == 12, string(""), vmean($1..$7); E
Mean value of a range unless there is any empty field.  Every field in the
range that is empty is replaced by @samp{nan} which lets @samp{vmean} result
in @samp{nan}.  Then @samp{typeof == 12} detects the @samp{nan} from
@samp{vmean} and the Org table result field is set to empty.  Use this when
the sample set is expected to never have missing values.
@item if("$1..$7" == "[]", string(""), vmean($1..$7))
Mean value of a range with empty fields skipped.  Every field in the range
that is empty is skipped.  When all fields in the range are empty the mean
value is not defined and the Org table result field is set to empty.  Use
this when the sample set can have a variable size.
@item vmean($1..$7); EN
To complete the example before: Mean value of a range with empty fields
counting as samples with value 0.  Use this only when incomplete sample sets
should be padded with 0 to the full size.
@end table

You can add your own Calc functions defined in Emacs Lisp with @code{defmath}
and use them in formula syntax for Calc.

@node Formula syntax for Lisp, Durations and time values, Formula syntax for Calc, The spreadsheet
@subsection Emacs Lisp forms as formulas
@cindex Lisp forms, as table formulas

It is also possible to write a formula in Emacs Lisp.  This can be useful
for string manipulation and control structures, if Calc's functionality is
not enough.

If a formula starts with an apostrophe followed by an opening parenthesis,
then it is evaluated as a Lisp form.  The evaluation should return either a
string or a number.  Just as with @file{calc} formulas, you can specify modes
and a printf format after a semicolon.

With Emacs Lisp forms, you need to be conscious about the way field
references are interpolated into the form.  By default, a reference will be
interpolated as a Lisp string (in double-quotes) containing the field.  If
you provide the @samp{N} mode switch, all referenced elements will be numbers
(non-number fields will be zero) and interpolated as Lisp numbers, without
quotes.  If you provide the @samp{L} flag, all fields will be interpolated
literally, without quotes.  I.e., if you want a reference to be interpreted
as a string by the Lisp form, enclose the reference operator itself in
double-quotes, like @code{"$3"}.  Ranges are inserted as space-separated
fields, so you can embed them in list or vector syntax.

Here are a few examples---note how the @samp{N} mode is used when we do
computations in Lisp:

@table @code
@item '(concat (substring $1 1 2) (substring $1 0 1) (substring $1 2))
Swap the first two characters of the content of column 1.
@item '(+ $1 $2);N
Add columns 1 and 2, equivalent to Calc's @code{$1+$2}.
@item '(apply '+ '($1..$4));N
Compute the sum of columns 1 to 4, like Calc's @code{vsum($1..$4)}.
@end table

@node Durations and time values, Field and range formulas, Formula syntax for Lisp, The spreadsheet
@subsection Durations and time values
@cindex Duration, computing
@cindex Time, computing
@vindex org-table-duration-custom-format

If you want to compute time values use the @code{T} flag, either in Calc
formulas or Elisp formulas:

@example
@group
  |  Task 1 |   Task 2 |    Total |
  |---------+----------+----------|
  |    2:12 |     1:47 | 03:59:00 |

  #+TBLFM: @@2$3=$1+$2;T::@@3$3=$1+$2;t
@end group
@end example

Input duration values must be of the form @code{[HH:MM[:SS]}, where seconds
are optional.  With the @code{T} flag, computed durations will be displayed
as @code{HH:MM:SS} (see the first formula above).  With the @code{t} flag,
computed durations will be displayed according to the value of the option
@code{org-table-duration-custom-format}, which defaults to @code{'hours} and
will display the result as a fraction of hours (see the second formula in the
example above).

Negative duration values can be manipulated as well, and integers will be
considered as seconds in addition and subtraction.

@node Field and range formulas, Column formulas, Durations and time values, The spreadsheet
@subsection Field and range formulas
@cindex field formula
@cindex range formula
@cindex formula, for individual table field
@cindex formula, for range of fields

To assign a formula to a particular field, type it directly into the field,
preceded by @samp{:=}, for example @samp{:=vsum(@@II..III)}.  When you press
@key{TAB} or @key{RET} or @kbd{C-c C-c} with the cursor still in the field,
the formula will be stored as the formula for this field, evaluated, and the
current field will be replaced with the result.

@cindex #+TBLFM
Formulas are stored in a special line starting with @samp{#+TBLFM:} directly
below the table.  If you type the equation in the 4th field of the 3rd data
line in the table, the formula will look like @samp{@@3$4=$1+$2}.  When
inserting/deleting/swapping column and rows with the appropriate commands,
@i{absolute references} (but not relative ones) in stored formulas are
modified in order to still reference the same field.  To avoid this from
happening, in particular in range references, anchor ranges at the table
borders (using @code{@@<}, @code{@@>}, @code{$<}, @code{$>}), or at hlines
using the @code{@@I} notation.  Automatic adaptation of field references does
of course not happen if you edit the table structure with normal editing
commands---then you must fix the equations yourself.

Instead of typing an equation into the field, you may also use the following
command

@table @kbd
@orgcmd{C-u C-c =,org-table-eval-formula}
Install a new formula for the current field.  The command prompts for a
formula with default taken from the @samp{#+TBLFM:} line, applies
it to the current field, and stores it.
@end table

The left-hand side of a formula can also be a special expression in order to
assign the formula to a number of different fields.  There is no keyboard
shortcut to enter such range formulas.  To add them, use the formula editor
(@pxref{Editing and debugging formulas}) or edit the @code{#+TBLFM:} line
directly.

@table @code
@item $2=
Column formula, valid for the entire column.  This is so common that Org
treats these formulas in a special way, see @ref{Column formulas}.
@item @@3=
Row formula, applies to all fields in the specified row.  @code{@@>=} means
the last row.
@item @@1$2..@@4$3=
Range formula, applies to all fields in the given rectangular range.  This
can also be used to assign a formula to some but not all fields in a row.
@item $name=
Named field, see @ref{Advanced features}.
@end table

@node Column formulas, Lookup functions, Field and range formulas, The spreadsheet
@subsection Column formulas
@cindex column formula
@cindex formula, for table column

When you assign a formula to a simple column reference like @code{$3=}, the
same formula will be used in all fields of that column, with the following
very convenient exceptions: (i) If the table contains horizontal separator
hlines with rows above and below, everything before the first such hline is
considered part of the table @emph{header} and will not be modified by column
formulas.  Therefore a header is mandatory when you use column formulas and
want to add hlines to group rows, like for example to separate a total row at
the bottom from the summand rows above.  (ii) Fields that already get a value
from a field/range formula will be left alone by column formulas.  These
conditions make column formulas very easy to use.

To assign a formula to a column, type it directly into any field in the
column, preceded by an equal sign, like @samp{=$1+$2}.  When you press
@key{TAB} or @key{RET} or @kbd{C-c C-c} with the cursor still in the field,
the formula will be stored as the formula for the current column, evaluated
and the current field replaced with the result.  If the field contains only
@samp{=}, the previously stored formula for this column is used.  For each
column, Org will only remember the most recently used formula.  In the
@samp{#+TBLFM:} line, column formulas will look like @samp{$4=$1+$2}.  The
left-hand side of a column formula can not be the name of column, it must be
the numeric column reference or @code{$>}.

Instead of typing an equation into the field, you may also use the
following command:

@table @kbd
@orgcmd{C-c =,org-table-eval-formula}
Install a new formula for the current column and replace current field with
the result of the formula.  The command prompts for a formula, with default
taken from the @samp{#+TBLFM} line, applies it to the current field and
stores it.  With a numeric prefix argument(e.g., @kbd{C-5 C-c =}) the command
will apply it to that many consecutive fields in the current column.

@subsection Lookup functions
@cindex lookup functions in tables
@cindex table lookup functions

Org has three predefined Emacs Lisp functions for lookups in tables.
@table @code
@item (org-lookup-first VAL S-LIST R-LIST &optional PREDICATE)
@findex org-lookup-first
Searches for the first element @code{S} in list @code{S-LIST} for which
@lisp
(PREDICATE VAL S)
@end lisp
is @code{t}; returns the value from the corresponding position in list
@code{R-LIST}.  The default @code{PREDICATE} is @code{equal}.  Note that the
parameters @code{VAL} and @code{S} are passed to @code{PREDICATE} in the same
order as the corresponding parameters are in the call to
@code{org-lookup-first}, where @code{VAL} precedes @code{S-LIST}.  If
@code{R-LIST} is @code{nil}, the matching element @code{S} of @code{S-LIST}
is returned.
@item (org-lookup-last VAL S-LIST R-LIST &optional PREDICATE)
@findex org-lookup-last
Similar to @code{org-lookup-first} above, but searches for the @i{last}
element for which @code{PREDICATE} is @code{t}.
@item (org-lookup-all VAL S-LIST R-LIST &optional PREDICATE)
@findex org-lookup-all
Similar to @code{org-lookup-first}, but searches for @i{all} elements for
which @code{PREDICATE} is @code{t}, and returns @i{all} corresponding
values.  This function can not be used by itself in a formula, because it
returns a list of values.  However, powerful lookups can be built when this
function is combined with other Emacs Lisp functions.
@end table

If the ranges used in these functions contain empty fields, the @code{E} mode
for the formula should usually be specified: otherwise empty fields will not be
included in @code{S-LIST} and/or @code{R-LIST} which can, for example, result
in an incorrect mapping from an element of @code{S-LIST} to the corresponding
element of @code{R-LIST}.

These three functions can be used to implement associative arrays, count
matching cells, rank results, group data etc.  For practical examples
see @uref{http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-lookups.html, this

minibuffer.  See @ref{Column formulas}, and @ref{Field and range formulas}.
@orgcmd{C-u C-u C-c =,org-table-eval-formula}
Re-insert the active formula (either a
field formula, or a column formula) into the current field, so that you
can edit it directly in the field.  The advantage over editing in the
minibuffer is that you can use the command @kbd{C-c ?}.
@orgcmd{C-c ?,org-table-field-info}
While editing a formula in a table field, highlight the field(s)
referenced by the reference at the cursor position in the formula.
@kindex C-c @}
@findex org-table-toggle-coordinate-overlays
@item C-c @}
Toggle the display of row and column numbers for a table, using overlays
(@command{org-table-toggle-coordinate-overlays}).  These are updated each
time the table is aligned; you can force it with @kbd{C-c C-c}.
@kindex C-c @{
@findex org-table-toggle-formula-debugger
@item C-c @{
Toggle the formula debugger on and off
(@command{org-table-toggle-formula-debugger}).  See below.
@orgcmd{C-c ',org-table-edit-formulas}
Edit all formulas for the current table in a special buffer, where the
formulas will be displayed one per line.  If the current field has an
active formula, the cursor in the formula editor will mark it.
While inside the special buffer, Org will automatically highlight
any field or range reference at the cursor position.  You may edit,
remove and add formulas, and use the following commands:

@table @kbd
@orgcmdkkc{C-c C-c,C-x C-s,org-table-fedit-finish}
Exit the formula editor and store the modified formulas.  With @kbd{C-u}
prefix, also apply the new formulas to the entire table.
@orgcmd{C-c C-q,org-table-fedit-abort}
Exit the formula editor without installing changes.
@orgcmd{C-c C-r,org-table-fedit-toggle-ref-type}
Toggle all references in the formula editor between standard (like
@code{B3}) and internal (like @code{@@3$2}).
@orgcmd{@key{TAB},org-table-fedit-lisp-indent}
Pretty-print or indent Lisp formula at point.  When in a line containing
a Lisp formula, format the formula according to Emacs Lisp rules.
Another @key{TAB} collapses the formula back again.  In the open
formula, @key{TAB} re-indents just like in Emacs Lisp mode.
@orgcmd{M-@key{TAB},lisp-complete-symbol}
Complete Lisp symbols, just like in Emacs Lisp mode.
@kindex S-@key{up}
@kindex S-@key{down}
@kindex S-@key{left}
@kindex S-@key{right}
@findex org-table-fedit-ref-up

@findex org-table-fedit-ref-left
@findex org-table-fedit-ref-right
@item S-@key{up}/@key{down}/@key{left}/@key{right}
Shift the reference at point.  For example, if the reference is
@code{B3} and you press @kbd{S-@key{right}}, it will become @code{C3}.
This also works for relative references and for hline references.
@orgcmdkkcc{M-S-@key{up},M-S-@key{down},org-table-fedit-line-up,org-table-fedit-line-down}
Move the test line for column formulas in the Org buffer up and
down.
@orgcmdkkcc{M-@key{up},M-@key{down},org-table-fedit-scroll-down,org-table-fedit-scroll-up}
Scroll the window displaying the table.
@kindex C-c @}
@findex org-table-toggle-coordinate-overlays
@item C-c @}
Turn the coordinate grid in the table on and off.
@end table
@end table

Making a table field blank does not remove the formula associated with
the field, because that is stored in a different line (the @samp{#+TBLFM}
line)---during the next recalculation the field will be filled again.
To remove a formula from a field, you have to give an empty reply when
prompted for the formula, or to edit the @samp{#+TBLFM} line.

@kindex C-c C-c
You may edit the @samp{#+TBLFM} directly and re-apply the changed
equations with @kbd{C-c C-c} in that line or with the normal
recalculation commands in the table.

@subsubheading Using multiple #+TBLFM lines
@cindex #+TBLFM line, multiple
@cindex #+TBLFM

@kindex C-c C-c

You may apply the formula temporarily.  This is useful when you
switch the formula.  Place multiple @samp{#+TBLFM} lines right
after the table, and then press @kbd{C-c C-c} on the formula to
apply.  Here is an example:

@example
| x | y |
|---+---|
| 1 |   |
| 2 |   |
#+TBLFM: $2=$1*1
#+TBLFM: $2=$1*2
@end example

@noindent
Pressing @kbd{C-c C-c} in the line of @samp{#+TBLFM: $2=$1*2} yields:

@example
| x | y |
|---+---|
| 1 | 2 |
| 2 | 4 |
#+TBLFM: $2=$1*1
#+TBLFM: $2=$1*2
@end example

@noindent
Note: If you recalculate this table (with @kbd{C-u C-c *}, for example), you
will get the following result of applying only the first @samp{#+TBLFM} line.

@example
| x | y |
|---+---|
| 1 | 1 |

#+TBLFM: $2=$1*1

@cindex recomputing table fields
@cindex updating, table

Recalculation of a table is normally not automatic, but needs to be
triggered by a command.  See @ref{Advanced features}, for a way to make
recalculation at least semi-automatic.

In order to recalculate a line of a table or the entire table, use the
following commands:

@table @kbd
@orgcmd{C-c *,org-table-recalculate}
Recalculate the current row by first applying the stored column formulas
from left to right, and all field/range formulas in the current row.
@c
@kindex C-u C-c *
@item C-u C-c *
@kindex C-u C-c C-c
@itemx C-u C-c C-c
Recompute the entire table, line by line.  Any lines before the first
hline are left alone, assuming that these are part of the table header.
@c
@orgcmdkkc{C-u C-u C-c *,C-u C-u C-c C-c,org-table-iterate}
Iterate the table by recomputing it until no further changes occur.
This may be necessary if some computed fields use the value of other
fields that are computed @i{later} in the calculation sequence.
@item M-x org-table-recalculate-buffer-tables RET
@findex org-table-recalculate-buffer-tables
Recompute all tables in the current buffer.
@item M-x org-table-iterate-buffer-tables RET
@findex org-table-iterate-buffer-tables
Iterate all tables in the current buffer, in order to converge table-to-table
dependencies.
@end table

@node Advanced features,  , Updating the table, The spreadsheet
@subsection Advanced features

If you want the recalculation of fields to happen automatically, or if you
want to be able to assign @i{names}@footnote{Such names must start by an
alphabetic character and use only alphanumeric/underscore characters.} to
fields and columns, you need to reserve the first column of the table for
special marking characters.

@table @kbd
@orgcmd{C-#,org-table-rotate-recalc-marks}
Rotate the calculation mark in first column through the states @samp{ },
@samp{#}, @samp{*}, @samp{!}, @samp{$}.  When there is an active region,
change all marks in the region.
@end table

Here is an example of a table that collects exam results of students and
makes use of these features:

@example
@group

@end group
@end example

@noindent @b{Important}: please note that for these special tables,
recalculating the table with @kbd{C-u C-c *} will only affect rows that
are marked @samp{#} or @samp{*}, and fields that have a formula assigned
to the field itself.  The column formulas are not applied in rows with
empty first field.

@cindex marking characters, tables
The marking characters have the following meaning:

@table @samp
@item !
The fields in this line define names for the columns, so that you may
refer to a column as @samp{$Tot} instead of @samp{$6}.
@item ^
This row defines names for the fields @emph{above} the row.  With such
a definition, any formula in the table may use @samp{$m1} to refer to
the value @samp{10}.  Also, if you assign a formula to a names field, it
will be stored as @samp{$name=...}.
@item _
Similar to @samp{^}, but defines names for the fields in the row
@emph{below}.
@item $
Fields in this row can define @emph{parameters} for formulas.  For
example, if a field in a @samp{$} row contains @samp{max=50}, then
formulas in this table can refer to the value 50 using @samp{$max}.
Parameters work exactly like constants, only that they can be defined on
a per-table basis.
@item #
Fields in this row are automatically recalculated when pressing
@key{TAB} or @key{RET} or @kbd{S-@key{TAB}} in this row.  Also, this row
is selected for a global recalculation with @kbd{C-u C-c *}.  Unmarked
lines will be left alone by this command.
@item *
Selects this line for global recalculation with @kbd{C-u C-c *}, but
not for automatic recalculation.  Use this when automatic
recalculation slows down editing too much.
@item @w{ }
Unmarked lines are exempt from recalculation with @kbd{C-u C-c *}.
All lines that should be recalculated should be marked with @samp{#}
or @samp{*}.
@item /
Do not export this line.  Useful for lines that contain the narrowing
@samp{<N>} markers or column group markers.
@end table

Finally, just to whet your appetite for what can be done with the
fantastic @file{calc.el} package, here is a table that computes the Taylor

that you have both Gnuplot and Gnuplot mode installed on your system, then
call @code{org-plot/gnuplot} on the following table.

Notice that Org Plot is smart enough to apply the table's headers as labels.
Further control over the labels, type, content, and appearance of plots can
be exercised through the @code{#+PLOT:} lines preceding a table.  See below
for a complete list of Org-plot options.  For more information and examples
see the Org-plot tutorial at
@uref{http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-plot.html}.

@subsubheading Plot Options

@table @code
@item set
Specify any @command{gnuplot} option to be set when graphing.

@item title
Specify the title of the plot.

@item ind
Specify which column of the table to use as the @code{x} axis.

@item deps
Specify the columns to graph as a Lisp style list, surrounded by parentheses
and separated by spaces for example @code{dep:(3 4)} to graph the third and
fourth columns (defaults to graphing all other columns aside from the @code{ind}
column).

@item type
Specify whether the plot will be @code{2d}, @code{3d}, or @code{grid}.

@item with
Specify a @code{with} option to be inserted for every col being plotted
(e.g., @code{lines}, @code{points}, @code{boxes}, @code{impulses}, etc...).
Defaults to @code{lines}.

@item file
If you want to plot to a file, specify @code{"@var{path/to/desired/output-file}"}.

@item labels
List of labels to be used for the @code{deps} (defaults to the column headers
if they exist).

@item line
Specify an entire line to be inserted in the Gnuplot script.

@item map
When plotting @code{3d} or @code{grid} types, set this to @code{t} to graph a
flat mapping rather than a @code{3d} slope.

@item timefmt
Specify format of Org mode timestamps as they will be parsed by Gnuplot.
Defaults to @samp{%Y-%m-%d-%H:%M:%S}.

@item script
If you want total control, you can specify a script file (place the file name
between double-quotes) which will be used to plot.  Before plotting, every
instance of @code{$datafile} in the specified script will be replaced with
the path to the generated data file.  Note: even if you set this option, you
may still want to specify the plot type, as that can impact the content of
the data file.

@cindex link format
@cindex format, of links

Org will recognize plain URL-like links and activate them as
clickable links.  The general link format, however, looks like this:

@example
[[link][description]]       @r{or alternatively}           [[link]]
@end example

@noindent
Once a link in the buffer is complete (all brackets present), Org
will change the display so that @samp{description} is displayed instead
of @samp{[[link][description]]} and @samp{link} is displayed instead of
@samp{[[link]]}.  Links will be highlighted in the face @code{org-link},
which by default is an underlined face.  You can directly edit the
visible part of a link.  Note that this can be either the @samp{link}
part (if there is no description) or the @samp{description} part.  To
edit also the invisible @samp{link} part, use @kbd{C-c C-l} with the
cursor on the link.

If you place the cursor at the beginning or just behind the end of the
displayed text and press @key{BACKSPACE}, you will remove the
(invisible) bracket at that location.  This makes the link incomplete
and the internals are again displayed as plain text.  Inserting the
missing bracket hides the link internals again.  To show the
internal structure of all links, use the menu entry
@code{Org->Hyperlinks->Literal links}.

@node Internal links, External links, Link format, Hyperlinks

@cindex internal links
@cindex links, internal
@cindex targets, for links

@cindex property, CUSTOM_ID
If the link does not look like a URL, it is considered to be internal in the
current file.  The most important case is a link like
@samp{[[#my-custom-id]]} which will link to the entry with the
@code{CUSTOM_ID} property @samp{my-custom-id}.  You are responsible yourself
to make sure these custom IDs are unique in a file.

Links such as @samp{[[My Target]]} or @samp{[[My Target][Find my target]]}
lead to a text search in the current file.

The link can be followed with @kbd{C-c C-o} when the cursor is on the link,
or with a mouse click (@pxref{Handling links}).  Links to custom IDs will
point to the corresponding headline.  The preferred match for a text link is
a @i{dedicated target}: the same string in double angular brackets, like
@samp{<<My Target>>}.

@cindex #+NAME
If no dedicated target exists, the link will then try to match the exact name
of an element within the buffer.  Naming is done with the @code{#+NAME}
keyword, which has to be put the line before the element it refers to, as in
the following example

@example
#+NAME: My Target
| a  | table      |
|----+------------|
| of | four cells |
@end example

If none of the above succeeds, Org will search for a headline that is exactly
the link text but may also include a TODO keyword and tags@footnote{To insert
a link targeting a headline, in-buffer completion can be used.  Just type
a star followed by a few optional letters into the buffer and press
@kbd{M-@key{TAB}}.  All headlines in the current buffer will be offered as
completions.}.

During export, internal links will be used to mark objects and assign them
a number.  Marked objects will then be referenced by links pointing to them.
In particular, links without a description will appear as the number assigned
to the marked object@footnote{When targeting a @code{#+NAME} keyword,
@code{#+CAPTION} keyword is mandatory in order to get proper numbering
(@pxref{Images and tables}).}.  In the following excerpt from an Org buffer

@example
- one item
- <<target>>another item
Here we refer to item [[target]].
@end example

@noindent
The last sentence will appear as @samp{Here we refer to item 2} when
exported.

In non-Org files, the search will look for the words in the link text.  In
the above example the search would be for @samp{my target}.

Following a link pushes a mark onto Org's own mark ring.  You can
return to the previous position with @kbd{C-c &}.  Using this command
several times in direct succession goes back to positions recorded
earlier.

Org can automatically turn any occurrences of certain target names
in normal text into a link.  So without explicitly creating a link, the
text connects to the target radioing its position.  Radio targets are
enclosed by triple angular brackets.  For example, a target @samp{<<<My
Target>>>} causes each occurrence of @samp{my target} in normal text to
become activated as a link.  The Org file is scanned automatically
for radio targets only when the file is first loaded into Emacs.  To
update the target list during editing, press @kbd{C-c C-c} with the
cursor on or at a target.

On top of these built-in link types, some are available through the
@code{contrib/} directory (@pxref{Installation}).  For example, these links
to VM or Wanderlust messages are available when you load the corresponding
libraries from the @code{contrib/} directory:

@example
vm:folder                                 @r{VM folder link}
vm:folder#id                              @r{VM message link}

@end example

For customizing Org to add new link types @ref{Adding hyperlink types}.

A link should be enclosed in double brackets and may contain a descriptive
text to be displayed instead of the URL (@pxref{Link format}), for example:

@example
[[http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU Emacs]]
@end example

@noindent
If the description is a file name or URL that points to an image, HTML
export (@pxref{HTML export}) will inline the image as a clickable
button.  If there is no description at all and the link points to an
image,
that image will be inlined into the exported HTML file.

@cindex square brackets, around links
@cindex plain text external links
Org also finds external links in the normal text and activates them
as links.  If spaces must be part of the link (for example in
@samp{bbdb:Richard Stallman}), or if you need to remove ambiguities
about the end of the link, enclose them in square brackets.

@node Handling links, Using links outside Org, External links, Hyperlinks
@section Handling links
@cindex links, handling

Org provides methods to create a link in the correct syntax, to
insert it into an Org file, and to follow the link.

@table @kbd
@orgcmd{C-c l,org-store-link}
@cindex storing links
Store a link to the current location.  This is a @emph{global} command (you
must create the key binding yourself) which can be used in any buffer to
create a link.  The link will be stored for later insertion into an Org
buffer (see below).  What kind of link will be created depends on the current
buffer:

@b{Org mode buffers}@*
For Org files, if there is a @samp{<<target>>} at the cursor, the link points
to the target.  Otherwise it points to the current headline, which will also
be the description@footnote{If the headline contains a timestamp, it will be
removed from the link and result in a wrong link---you should avoid putting
timestamp in the headline.}.

@vindex org-id-link-to-org-use-id
@cindex property, CUSTOM_ID
@cindex property, ID
If the headline has a @code{CUSTOM_ID} property, a link to this custom ID
will be stored.  In addition or alternatively (depending on the value of
@code{org-id-link-to-org-use-id}), a globally unique @code{ID} property will
be created and/or used to construct a link@footnote{The library
@file{org-id.el} must first be loaded, either through @code{org-customize} by
enabling @code{org-id} in @code{org-modules}, or by adding @code{(require
'org-id)} in your @file{.emacs}.}. So using this command in Org buffers will
potentially create two links: a human-readable from the custom ID, and one
that is globally unique and works even if the entry is moved from file to
file.  Later, when inserting the link, you need to decide which one to use.

@b{Email/News clients: VM, Rmail, Wanderlust, MH-E, Gnus}@*
Pretty much all Emacs mail clients are supported.  The link will point to the
current article, or, in some GNUS buffers, to the group.  The description is
constructed from the author and the subject.

@b{Web browsers: W3 and W3M}@*
Here the link will be the current URL, with the page title as description.

@b{Contacts: BBDB}@*
Links created in a BBDB buffer will point to the current entry.

@b{Chat: IRC}@*
@vindex org-irc-link-to-logs
For IRC links, if you set the option @code{org-irc-link-to-logs} to @code{t},
a @samp{file:/} style link to the relevant point in the logs for the current
conversation is created.  Otherwise an @samp{irc:/} style link to the
user/channel/server under the point will be stored.

@b{Other files}@*
For any other files, the link will point to the file, with a search string
(@pxref{Search options}) pointing to the contents of the current line.  If
there is an active region, the selected words will form the basis of the
search string.  If the automatically created link is not working correctly or
accurately enough, you can write custom functions to select the search string
and to do the search for particular file types---see @ref{Custom searches}.
The key binding @kbd{C-c l} is only a suggestion---see @ref{Installation}.

@b{Agenda view}@*
When the cursor is in an agenda view, the created link points to the
entry referenced by the current line.

@c
@orgcmd{C-c C-l,org-insert-link}
@cindex link completion
@cindex completion, of links
@cindex inserting links
@vindex org-keep-stored-link-after-insertion
Insert a link@footnote{ Note that you don't have to use this command to
insert a link.  Links in Org are plain text, and you can type or paste them
straight into the buffer.  By using this command, the links are automatically
enclosed in double brackets, and you will be asked for the optional
descriptive text.}.  This prompts for a link to be inserted into the buffer.
You can just type a link, using text for an internal link, or one of the link
type prefixes mentioned in the examples above.  The link will be inserted
into the buffer@footnote{After insertion of a stored link, the link will be
removed from the list of stored links.  To keep it in the list later use, use
a triple @kbd{C-u} prefix argument to @kbd{C-c C-l}, or configure the option
@code{org-keep-stored-link-after-insertion}.}, along with a descriptive text.
If some text was selected when this command is called, the selected text
becomes the default description.

@b{Inserting stored links}@*
All links stored during the
current session are part of the history for this prompt, so you can access
them with @key{up} and @key{down} (or @kbd{M-p/n}).

@b{Completion support}@* Completion with @key{TAB} will help you to insert
valid link prefixes like @samp{http:} or @samp{ftp:}, including the prefixes
defined through link abbreviations (@pxref{Link abbreviations}).  If you
press @key{RET} after inserting only the @var{prefix}, Org will offer
specific completion support for some link types@footnote{This works by
calling a special function @code{org-PREFIX-complete-link}.}  For
example, if you type @kbd{file @key{RET}}, file name completion (alternative
access: @kbd{C-u C-c C-l}, see below) will be offered, and after @kbd{bbdb
@key{RET}} you can complete contact names.
@orgkey C-u C-c C-l
@cindex file name completion
@cindex completion, of file names
When @kbd{C-c C-l} is called with a @kbd{C-u} prefix argument, a link to
a file will be inserted and you may use file name completion to select
the name of the file.  The path to the file is inserted relative to the
directory of the current Org file, if the linked file is in the current
directory or in a sub-directory of it, or if the path is written relative
to the current directory using @samp{../}.  Otherwise an absolute path
is used, if possible with @samp{~/} for your home directory.  You can
force an absolute path with two @kbd{C-u} prefixes.
@c
@item C-c C-l @ @r{(with cursor on existing link)}
When the cursor is on an existing link, @kbd{C-c C-l} allows you to edit the
link and description parts of the link.
@c
@cindex following links
@orgcmd{C-c C-o,org-open-at-point}
@vindex org-file-apps
@vindex org-link-frame-setup
Open link at point.  This will launch a web browser for URLs (using
@command{browse-url-at-point}), run VM/MH-E/Wanderlust/Rmail/Gnus/BBDB for
the corresponding links, and execute the command in a shell link.  When the
cursor is on an internal link, this command runs the corresponding search.
When the cursor is on a TAG list in a headline, it creates the corresponding
TAGS view.  If the cursor is on a timestamp, it compiles the agenda for that
date.  Furthermore, it will visit text and remote files in @samp{file:} links
with Emacs and select a suitable application for local non-text files.
Classification of files is based on file extension only.  See option
@code{org-file-apps}.  If you want to override the default application and
visit the file with Emacs, use a @kbd{C-u} prefix.  If you want to avoid
opening in Emacs, use a @kbd{C-u C-u} prefix.@*
If the cursor is on a headline, but not on a link, offer all links in the
headline and entry text.  If you want to setup the frame configuration for
following links, customize @code{org-link-frame-setup}.

@orgkey @key{RET}
@vindex org-return-follows-link
When @code{org-return-follows-link} is set, @kbd{@key{RET}} will also follow
the link at point.
@c
@kindex mouse-2
@kindex mouse-1
@item mouse-2
@itemx mouse-1
On links, @kbd{mouse-2} will open the link just as @kbd{C-c C-o}
would.  Under Emacs 22 and later, @kbd{mouse-1} will also follow a link.
@c
@kindex mouse-3
@item mouse-3
@vindex org-display-internal-link-with-indirect-buffer
Like @kbd{mouse-2}, but force file links to be opened with Emacs, and
internal links to be displayed in another window@footnote{See the
option @code{org-display-internal-link-with-indirect-buffer}}.
@c
@orgcmd{C-c C-x C-v,org-toggle-inline-images}
@cindex inlining images
@cindex images, inlining
@vindex org-startup-with-inline-images
@cindex @code{inlineimages}, STARTUP keyword
@cindex @code{noinlineimages}, STARTUP keyword
Toggle the inline display of linked images.  Normally this will only inline
images that have no description part in the link, i.e., images that will also
be inlined during export.  When called with a prefix argument, also display
images that do have a link description.  You can ask for inline images to be
displayed at startup by configuring the variable
@code{org-startup-with-inline-images}@footnote{with corresponding
@code{#+STARTUP} keywords @code{inlineimages} and @code{noinlineimages}}.
@orgcmd{C-c %,org-mark-ring-push}
@cindex mark ring
Push the current position onto the mark ring, to be able to return
easily.  Commands following an internal link do this automatically.
@c
@orgcmd{C-c &,org-mark-ring-goto}
@cindex links, returning to
Jump back to a recorded position.  A position is recorded by the
commands following internal links, and by @kbd{C-c %}.  Using this
command several times in direct succession moves through a ring of
previously recorded positions.
@c
@orgcmdkkcc{C-c C-x C-n,C-c C-x C-p,org-next-link,org-previous-link}
@cindex links, finding next/previous
Move forward/backward to the next link in the buffer.  At the limit of
the buffer, the search fails once, and then wraps around.  The key
bindings for this are really too long; you might want to bind this also
to @kbd{C-n} and @kbd{C-p}

@node Using links outside Org, Link abbreviations, Handling links, Hyperlinks
@section Using links outside Org

You can insert and follow links that have Org syntax not only in
Org, but in any Emacs buffer.  For this, you should create two
global commands, like this (please select suitable global keys
yourself):

@lisp
(global-set-key "\C-c L" 'org-insert-link-global)
(global-set-key "\C-c o" 'org-open-at-point-global)
@end lisp

@node Link abbreviations, Search options, Using links outside Org, Hyperlinks
@section Link abbreviations
@cindex link abbreviations
@cindex abbreviation, links

Long URLs can be cumbersome to type, and often many similar links are
needed in a document.  For this you can use link abbreviations.  An
abbreviated link looks like this

@example
[[linkword:tag][description]]
@end example

@noindent
@vindex org-link-abbrev-alist
where the tag is optional.
The @i{linkword} must be a word, starting with a letter, followed by
letters, numbers, @samp{-}, and @samp{_}.  Abbreviations are resolved
according to the information in the variable @code{org-link-abbrev-alist}
that relates the linkwords to replacement text.  Here is an example:

@smalllisp
@group
(setq org-link-abbrev-alist
  '(("bugzilla"  . "http://10.1.2.9/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=")
    ("url-to-ja" . "http://translate.google.fr/translate?sl=en&tl=ja&u=%h")
    ("google"    . "http://www.google.com/search?q=")
    ("gmap"      . "http://maps.google.com/maps?q=%s")
    ("omap"      . "http://nominatim.openstreetmap.org/search?q=%s&polygon=1")
    ("ads"       . "http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-abs_connect?author=%s&db_key=AST")))
@end group
@end smalllisp

If the replacement text contains the string @samp{%s}, it will be
replaced with the tag.  Using @samp{%h} instead of @samp{%s} will
url-encode the tag (see the example above, where we need to encode
the URL parameter.)  Using @samp{%(my-function)} will pass the tag
to a custom function, and replace it by the resulting string.

If the replacement text don't contain any specifier, it will simply
be appended to the string in order to create the link.

Instead of a string, you may also specify a function that will be
called with the tag as the only argument to create the link.

With the above setting, you could link to a specific bug with
@code{[[bugzilla:129]]}, search the web for @samp{OrgMode} with
@code{[[google:OrgMode]]}, show the map location of the Free Software
Foundation @code{[[gmap:51 Franklin Street, Boston]]} or of Carsten office
@code{[[omap:Science Park 904, Amsterdam, The Netherlands]]} and find out
what the Org author is doing besides Emacs hacking with
@code{[[ads:Dominik,C]]}.

If you need special abbreviations just for a single Org buffer, you
can define them in the file with

@cindex #+LINK
@example
#+LINK: bugzilla  http://10.1.2.9/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=
#+LINK: google    http://www.google.com/search?q=%s
@end example

@noindent
In-buffer completion (@pxref{Completion}) can be used after @samp{[} to
complete link abbreviations.  You may also define a function
@code{org-PREFIX-complete-link} that implements special (e.g., completion)
support for inserting such a link with @kbd{C-c C-l}.  Such a function should
not accept any arguments, and return the full link with prefix.

@node Search options, Custom searches, Link abbreviations, Hyperlinks
@section Search options in file links
@cindex search option in file links
@cindex file links, searching

File links can contain additional information to make Emacs jump to a
particular location in the file when following a link.  This can be a
line number or a search option after a double@footnote{For backward
compatibility, line numbers can also follow a single colon.} colon.  For
example, when the command @kbd{C-c l} creates a link (@pxref{Handling
links}) to a file, it encodes the words in the current line as a search
string that can be used to find this line back later when following the
link with @kbd{C-c C-o}.

Here is the syntax of the different ways to attach a search to a file
link, together with an explanation:

@example
[[file:~/code/main.c::255]]
[[file:~/xx.org::My Target]]
[[file:~/xx.org::*My Target]]
[[file:~/xx.org::#my-custom-id]]
[[file:~/xx.org::/regexp/]]
@end example

@table @code
@item 255
Jump to line 255.
@item My Target
Search for a link target @samp{<<My Target>>}, or do a text search for
@samp{my target}, similar to the search in internal links, see
@ref{Internal links}.  In HTML export (@pxref{HTML export}), such a file
link will become an HTML reference to the corresponding named anchor in
the linked file.
@item *My Target
In an Org file, restrict search to headlines.
@item #my-custom-id
Link to a heading with a @code{CUSTOM_ID} property
@item /regexp/
Do a regular expression search for @code{regexp}.  This uses the Emacs
command @code{occur} to list all matches in a separate window.  If the
target file is in Org mode, @code{org-occur} is used to create a
sparse tree with the matches.
@c If the target file is a directory,
@c @code{grep} will be used to search all files in the directory.
@end table

As a degenerate case, a file link with an empty file name can be used
to search the current file.  For example, @code{[[file:::find me]]} does
a search for @samp{find me} in the current file, just as
@samp{[[find me]]} would.

@node Custom searches,  , Search options, Hyperlinks
@section Custom Searches
@cindex custom search strings
@cindex search strings, custom

The default mechanism for creating search strings and for doing the
actual search related to a file link may not work correctly in all
cases.  For example, Bib@TeX{} database files have many entries like
@samp{year="1993"} which would not result in good search strings,
because the only unique identification for a Bib@TeX{} entry is the
citation key.

@vindex org-create-file-search-functions
@vindex org-execute-file-search-functions
If you come across such a problem, you can write custom functions to set
the right search string for a particular file type, and to do the search
for the string in the file.  Using @code{add-hook}, these functions need
to be added to the hook variables
@code{org-create-file-search-functions} and
@code{org-execute-file-search-functions}.  See the docstring for these
variables for more information.  Org actually uses this mechanism
for Bib@TeX{} database files, and you can use the corresponding code as
an implementation example.  See the file @file{org-bibtex.el}.

@node TODO Items, Tags, Hyperlinks, Top
@chapter TODO items
@cindex TODO items

Org mode does not maintain TODO lists as separate documents@footnote{Of
course, you can make a document that contains only long lists of TODO items,
but this is not required.}.  Instead, TODO items are an integral part of the
notes file, because TODO items usually come up while taking notes!  With Org
mode, simply mark any entry in a tree as being a TODO item.  In this way,
information is not duplicated, and the entire context from which the TODO
item emerged is always present.

Of course, this technique for managing TODO items scatters them
throughout your notes file.  Org mode compensates for this by providing
methods to give you an overview of all the things that you have to do.

@section Basic TODO functionality

Any headline becomes a TODO item when it starts with the word
@samp{TODO}, for example:

@example
*** TODO Write letter to Sam Fortune
@end example

@noindent
The most important commands to work with TODO entries are:

@table @kbd
@orgcmd{C-c C-t,org-todo}
@cindex cycling, of TODO states
@vindex org-use-fast-todo-selection

Rotate the TODO state of the current item among

@example
,-> (unmarked) -> TODO -> DONE --.
'--------------------------------'
@end example

If TODO keywords have fast access keys (see @ref{Fast access to TODO
states}), you will be prompted for a TODO keyword through the fast selection
interface; this is the default behavior when
@code{org-use-fast-todo-selection} is non-@code{nil}.

The same rotation can also be done ``remotely'' from the timeline and agenda
buffers with the @kbd{t} command key (@pxref{Agenda commands}).

@orgkey{C-u C-c C-t}
When TODO keywords have no selection keys, select a specific keyword using
completion; otherwise force cycling through TODO states with no prompt.  When
@code{org-use-fast-todo-selection} is set to @code{prefix}, use the fast
selection interface.

@kindex S-@key{right}
@kindex S-@key{left}
@item S-@key{right} @ @r{/} @ S-@key{left}
@vindex org-treat-S-cursor-todo-selection-as-state-change
Select the following/preceding TODO state, similar to cycling.  Useful
mostly if more than two TODO states are possible (@pxref{TODO
extensions}).  See also @ref{Conflicts}, for a discussion of the interaction
with @code{shift-selection-mode}.  See also the variable
@code{org-treat-S-cursor-todo-selection-as-state-change}.
@orgcmd{C-c / t,org-show-todo-tree}
@cindex sparse tree, for TODO
@vindex org-todo-keywords
View TODO items in a @emph{sparse tree} (@pxref{Sparse trees}).  Folds the
entire buffer, but shows all TODO items (with not-DONE state) and the
headings hierarchy above them.  With a prefix argument (or by using @kbd{C-c
/ T}), search for a specific TODO@.  You will be prompted for the keyword,
and you can also give a list of keywords like @code{KWD1|KWD2|...} to list
entries that match any one of these keywords.  With a numeric prefix argument
N, show the tree for the Nth keyword in the option @code{org-todo-keywords}.
With two prefix arguments, find all TODO states, both un-done and done.
@orgcmd{C-c a t,org-todo-list}
Show the global TODO list.  Collects the TODO items (with not-DONE states)
from all agenda files (@pxref{Agenda Views}) into a single buffer.  The new
buffer will be in @code{agenda-mode}, which provides commands to examine and
manipulate the TODO entries from the new buffer (@pxref{Agenda commands}).

@node Workflow states, TODO types, TODO extensions, TODO extensions
@subsection TODO keywords as workflow states
@cindex TODO workflow
@cindex workflow states as TODO keywords

You can use TODO keywords to indicate different @emph{sequential} states
in the process of working on an item, for example@footnote{Changing
this variable only becomes effective after restarting Org mode in a
buffer.}:

@lisp
(setq org-todo-keywords
  '((sequence "TODO" "FEEDBACK" "VERIFY" "|" "DONE" "DELEGATED")))
@end lisp

The vertical bar separates the TODO keywords (states that @emph{need
action}) from the DONE states (which need @emph{no further action}).  If
you don't provide the separator bar, the last state is used as the DONE
state.
@cindex completion, of TODO keywords
With this setup, the command @kbd{C-c C-t} will cycle an entry from TODO
to FEEDBACK, then to VERIFY, and finally to DONE and DELEGATED@.  You may
also use a numeric prefix argument to quickly select a specific state.  For
example @kbd{C-3 C-c C-t} will change the state immediately to VERIFY@.
Or you can use @kbd{S-@key{left}} to go backward through the sequence.  If you
define many keywords, you can use in-buffer completion
(@pxref{Completion}) or even a special one-key selection scheme
(@pxref{Fast access to TODO states}) to insert these words into the
buffer.  Changing a TODO state can be logged with a timestamp, see
@ref{Tracking TODO state changes}, for more information.

@node TODO types, Multiple sets in one file, Workflow states, TODO extensions
@subsection TODO keywords as types
@cindex TODO types
@cindex names as TODO keywords
@cindex types as TODO keywords

The second possibility is to use TODO keywords to indicate different
@emph{types} of action items.  For example, you might want to indicate
that items are for ``work'' or ``home''.  Or, when you work with several
people on a single project, you might want to assign action items
directly to persons, by using their names as TODO keywords.  This would
be set up like this:

@lisp
(setq org-todo-keywords '((type "Fred" "Sara" "Lucy" "|" "DONE")))
@end lisp

In this case, different keywords do not indicate a sequence, but rather
different types.  So the normal work flow would be to assign a task to a
person, and later to mark it DONE@.  Org mode supports this style by adapting
the workings of the command @kbd{C-c C-t}@footnote{This is also true for the
@kbd{t} command in the timeline and agenda buffers.}.  When used several
times in succession, it will still cycle through all names, in order to first
select the right type for a task.  But when you return to the item after some
time and execute @kbd{C-c C-t} again, it will switch from any name directly
to DONE@.  Use prefix arguments or completion to quickly select a specific
name.  You can also review the items of a specific TODO type in a sparse tree
by using a numeric prefix to @kbd{C-c / t}.  For example, to see all things
Lucy has to do, you would use @kbd{C-3 C-c / t}.  To collect Lucy's items
from all agenda files into a single buffer, you would use the numeric prefix
argument as well when creating the global TODO list: @kbd{C-3 C-c a t}.

@node Multiple sets in one file, Fast access to TODO states, TODO types, TODO extensions
@subsection Multiple keyword sets in one file

Sometimes you may want to use different sets of TODO keywords in
parallel.  For example, you may want to have the basic
@code{TODO}/@code{DONE}, but also a workflow for bug fixing, and a
separate state indicating that an item has been canceled (so it is not
DONE, but also does not require action).  Your setup would then look
like this:

@lisp
(setq org-todo-keywords
      '((sequence "TODO" "|" "DONE")
        (sequence "REPORT" "BUG" "KNOWNCAUSE" "|" "FIXED")
        (sequence "|" "CANCELED")))
@end lisp

The keywords should all be different, this helps Org mode to keep track
of which subsequence should be used for a given entry.  In this setup,
@kbd{C-c C-t} only operates within a subsequence, so it switches from
@code{DONE} to (nothing) to @code{TODO}, and from @code{FIXED} to
(nothing) to @code{REPORT}.  Therefore you need a mechanism to initially
select the correct sequence.  Besides the obvious ways like typing a
keyword or using completion, you may also apply the following commands:

@table @kbd
@kindex C-S-@key{right}
@kindex C-S-@key{left}
@kindex C-u C-u C-c C-t
@item C-u C-u C-c C-t
@itemx C-S-@key{right}
@itemx C-S-@key{left}
These keys jump from one TODO subset to the next.  In the above example,
@kbd{C-u C-u C-c C-t} or @kbd{C-S-@key{right}} would jump from @code{TODO} or
@code{DONE} to @code{REPORT}, and any of the words in the second row to
@code{CANCELED}.  Note that the @kbd{C-S-} key binding conflict with
@code{shift-selection-mode} (@pxref{Conflicts}).
@kindex S-@key{right}
@kindex S-@key{left}
@item S-@key{right}
@itemx S-@key{left}
@kbd{S-@key{<left>}} and @kbd{S-@key{<right>}} and walk through @emph{all}
keywords from all sets, so for example @kbd{S-@key{<right>}} would switch
from @code{DONE} to @code{REPORT} in the example above.  See also
@ref{Conflicts}, for a discussion of the interaction with
@code{shift-selection-mode}.

@node Fast access to TODO states, Per-file keywords, Multiple sets in one file, TODO extensions
@subsection Fast access to TODO states

If you would like to quickly change an entry to an arbitrary TODO state
instead of cycling through the states, you can set up keys for single-letter
access to the states.  This is done by adding the selection character after
each keyword, in parentheses@footnote{All characters are allowed except
@code{@@^!}, which have a special meaning here.}.  For example:

@lisp
(setq org-todo-keywords
      '((sequence "TODO(t)" "|" "DONE(d)")
        (sequence "REPORT(r)" "BUG(b)" "KNOWNCAUSE(k)" "|" "FIXED(f)")
        (sequence "|" "CANCELED(c)")))
@end lisp

@vindex org-fast-tag-selection-include-todo
If you then press @kbd{C-c C-t} followed by the selection key, the entry
will be switched to this state.  @kbd{SPC} can be used to remove any TODO
keyword from an entry.@footnote{Check also the option
@code{org-fast-tag-selection-include-todo}, it allows you to change the TODO
state through the tags interface (@pxref{Setting tags}), in case you like to
mingle the two concepts.  Note that this means you need to come up with
unique keys across both sets of keywords.}

@node Per-file keywords, Faces for TODO keywords, Fast access to TODO states, TODO extensions
@subsection Setting up keywords for individual files
@cindex keyword options
@cindex per-file keywords
@cindex #+TODO
@cindex #+TYP_TODO
@cindex #+SEQ_TODO

It can be very useful to use different aspects of the TODO mechanism in
different files.  For file-local settings, you need to add special lines
to the file which set the keywords and interpretation for that file
only.  For example, to set one of the two examples discussed above, you
need one of the following lines, starting in column zero anywhere in the
file:

@example
#+TODO: TODO FEEDBACK VERIFY | DONE CANCELED
@end example
@noindent (you may also write @code{#+SEQ_TODO} to be explicit about the
interpretation, but it means the same as @code{#+TODO}), or
@example
#+TYP_TODO: Fred Sara Lucy Mike | DONE
@end example

A setup for using several sets in parallel would be:

@example
#+TODO: TODO | DONE
#+TODO: REPORT BUG KNOWNCAUSE | FIXED
#+TODO: | CANCELED
@end example

@cindex completion, of option keywords
@kindex M-@key{TAB}
@noindent To make sure you are using the correct keyword, type
@samp{#+} into the buffer and then use @kbd{M-@key{TAB}} completion.

@cindex DONE, final TODO keyword
Remember that the keywords after the vertical bar (or the last keyword
if no bar is there) must always mean that the item is DONE (although you
may use a different word).  After changing one of these lines, use
@kbd{C-c C-c} with the cursor still in the line to make the changes
known to Org mode@footnote{Org mode parses these lines only when
Org mode is activated after visiting a file.  @kbd{C-c C-c} with the
cursor in a line starting with @samp{#+} is simply restarting Org mode
for the current buffer.}.

@subsection Faces for TODO keywords
@cindex faces, for TODO keywords

@vindex org-todo @r{(face)}
@vindex org-done @r{(face)}
@vindex org-todo-keyword-faces
Org mode highlights TODO keywords with special faces: @code{org-todo}
for keywords indicating that an item still has to be acted upon, and
@code{org-done} for keywords indicating that an item is finished.  If
you are using more than 2 different states, you might want to use
special faces for some of them.  This can be done using the option
@code{org-todo-keyword-faces}.  For example:

@lisp
@group
(setq org-todo-keyword-faces
      '(("TODO" . org-warning) ("STARTED" . "yellow")
        ("CANCELED" . (:foreground "blue" :weight bold))))
@end group
@end lisp

While using a list with face properties as shown for CANCELED @emph{should}
work, this does not always seem to be the case.  If necessary, define a
special face and use that.  A string is interpreted as a color.  The option
@code{org-faces-easy-properties} determines if that color is interpreted as a
foreground or a background color.

@subsection TODO dependencies
@cindex TODO dependencies
@cindex dependencies, of TODO states

@vindex org-enforce-todo-dependencies
@cindex property, ORDERED
The structure of Org files (hierarchy and lists) makes it easy to define TODO
dependencies.  Usually, a parent TODO task should not be marked DONE until
all subtasks (defined as children tasks) are marked as DONE@.  And sometimes
there is a logical sequence to a number of (sub)tasks, so that one task
cannot be acted upon before all siblings above it are done.  If you customize
the option @code{org-enforce-todo-dependencies}, Org will block entries
from changing state to DONE while they have children that are not DONE@.
Furthermore, if an entry has a property @code{ORDERED}, each of its children
will be blocked until all earlier siblings are marked DONE@.  Here is an
example:

@example
* TODO Blocked until (two) is done
** DONE one
** TODO two

* Parent
  :PROPERTIES:
  :ORDERED: t
  :END:
** TODO a
** TODO b, needs to wait for (a)
** TODO c, needs to wait for (a) and (b)
@end example

@table @kbd
@orgcmd{C-c C-x o,org-toggle-ordered-property}
@vindex org-track-ordered-property-with-tag
@cindex property, ORDERED
Toggle the @code{ORDERED} property of the current entry.  A property is used
for this behavior because this should be local to the current entry, not
inherited like a tag.  However, if you would like to @i{track} the value of
this property with a tag for better visibility, customize the option
@code{org-track-ordered-property-with-tag}.
@orgkey{C-u C-u C-u C-c C-t}
Change TODO state, circumventing any state blocking.
@end table

@vindex org-agenda-dim-blocked-tasks
If you set the option @code{org-agenda-dim-blocked-tasks}, TODO entries
that cannot be closed because of such dependencies will be shown in a dimmed

@vindex org-enforce-todo-dependencies
You can also block changes of TODO states by looking at checkboxes
(@pxref{Checkboxes}).  If you set the option

Org mode can automatically record a timestamp and possibly a note when
you mark a TODO item as DONE, or even each time you change the state of
a TODO item.  This system is highly configurable; settings can be on a
per-keyword basis and can be localized to a file or even a subtree.  For
information on how to clock working time for a task, see @ref{Clocking

@end menu

@node Closing items, Tracking TODO state changes, Progress logging, Progress logging
@subsection Closing items

The most basic logging is to keep track of @emph{when} a certain TODO
item was finished.  This is achieved with@footnote{The corresponding
in-buffer setting is: @code{#+STARTUP: logdone}}

@lisp
(setq org-log-done 'time)
@end lisp

@vindex org-closed-keep-when-no-todo
@noindent
Then each time you turn an entry from a TODO (not-done) state into any of the
DONE states, a line @samp{CLOSED: [timestamp]} will be inserted just after
the headline.  If you turn the entry back into a TODO item through further
state cycling, that line will be removed again.  If you turn the entry back
to a non-TODO state (by pressing @key{C-c C-t SPC} for example), that line
will also be removed, unless you set @code{org-closed-keep-when-no-todo} to
non-@code{nil}.  If you want to record a note along with the timestamp,
use@footnote{The corresponding in-buffer setting is: @code{#+STARTUP:
lognotedone}.}

@lisp
(setq org-log-done 'note)
@end lisp

@noindent
You will then be prompted for a note, and that note will be stored below
the entry with a @samp{Closing Note} heading.

In the timeline (@pxref{Timeline}) and in the agenda
(@pxref{Weekly/daily agenda}), you can then use the @kbd{l} key to
display the TODO items with a @samp{CLOSED} timestamp on each day,
giving you an overview of what has been done.

@subsection Tracking TODO state changes
@cindex drawer, for state change recording

@vindex org-log-states-order-reversed
@vindex org-log-into-drawer
@cindex property, LOG_INTO_DRAWER
When TODO keywords are used as workflow states (@pxref{Workflow states}), you
might want to keep track of when a state change occurred and maybe take a
note about this change.  You can either record just a timestamp, or a
time-stamped note for a change.  These records will be inserted after the
headline as an itemized list, newest first@footnote{See the option
@code{org-log-states-order-reversed}}.  When taking a lot of notes, you might
want to get the notes out of the way into a drawer (@pxref{Drawers}).
Customize @code{org-log-into-drawer} to get this behavior---the recommended
drawer for this is called @code{LOGBOOK}@footnote{Note that the
@code{LOGBOOK} drawer is unfolded when pressing @key{SPC} in the agenda to
show an entry---use @key{C-u SPC} to keep it folded here}.  You can also
overrule the setting of this variable for a subtree by setting a
@code{LOG_INTO_DRAWER} property.

Since it is normally too much to record a note for every state, Org mode
expects configuration on a per-keyword basis for this.  This is achieved by
adding special markers @samp{!} (for a timestamp) or @samp{@@} (for a note
with timestamp) in parentheses after each keyword.  For example, with the
setting

@lisp
(setq org-todo-keywords
  '((sequence "TODO(t)" "WAIT(w@@/!)" "|" "DONE(d!)" "CANCELED(c@@)")))
@end lisp

To record a timestamp without a note for TODO keywords configured with
@samp{@@}, just type @kbd{C-c C-c} to enter a blank note when prompted.

@noindent
@vindex org-log-done
You not only define global TODO keywords and fast access keys, but also
request that a time is recorded when the entry is set to
DONE@footnote{It is possible that Org mode will record two timestamps
when you are using both @code{org-log-done} and state change logging.
However, it will never prompt for two notes---if you have configured
both, the state change recording note will take precedence and cancel
the @samp{Closing Note}.}, and that a note is recorded when switching to
WAIT or CANCELED@.  The setting for WAIT is even more special: the
@samp{!} after the slash means that in addition to the note taken when
entering the state, a timestamp should be recorded when @i{leaving} the
WAIT state, if and only if the @i{target} state does not configure
logging for entering it.  So it has no effect when switching from WAIT
to DONE, because DONE is configured to record a timestamp only.  But
when switching from WAIT back to TODO, the @samp{/!} in the WAIT
setting now triggers a timestamp even though TODO has no logging
configured.

You can use the exact same syntax for setting logging preferences local
to a buffer:
@example
#+TODO: TODO(t) WAIT(w@@/!) | DONE(d!) CANCELED(c@@)
@end example

@cindex property, LOGGING
In order to define logging settings that are local to a subtree or a
single item, define a LOGGING property in this entry.  Any non-empty
LOGGING property resets all logging settings to @code{nil}.  You may then turn
on logging for this specific tree using STARTUP keywords like
@code{lognotedone} or @code{logrepeat}, as well as adding state specific
settings like @code{TODO(!)}.  For example

@example
* TODO Log each state with only a time
  :PROPERTIES:
  :LOGGING: TODO(!) WAIT(!) DONE(!) CANCELED(!)
  :END:
* TODO Only log when switching to WAIT, and when repeating
  :PROPERTIES:
  :LOGGING: WAIT(@@) logrepeat
  :END:
* TODO No logging at all
  :PROPERTIES:
  :LOGGING: nil
  :END:
@end example

@node Tracking your habits,  , Tracking TODO state changes, Progress logging
@subsection Tracking your habits
@cindex habits

Org has the ability to track the consistency of a special category of TODOs,
called ``habits''.  A habit has the following properties:

@enumerate
@item
You have enabled the @code{habits} module by customizing @code{org-modules}.
@item
The habit is a TODO item, with a TODO keyword representing an open state.
@item
The property @code{STYLE} is set to the value @code{habit}.
@item
The TODO has a scheduled date, usually with a @code{.+} style repeat
interval.  A @code{++} style may be appropriate for habits with time
constraints, e.g., must be done on weekends, or a @code{+} style for an
unusual habit that can have a backlog, e.g., weekly reports.
@item
The TODO may also have minimum and maximum ranges specified by using the
syntax @samp{.+2d/3d}, which says that you want to do the task at least every
three days, but at most every two days.
@item
You must also have state logging for the @code{DONE} state enabled
(@pxref{Tracking TODO state changes}), in order for historical data to be
represented in the consistency graph.  If it is not enabled it is not an
error, but the consistency graphs will be largely meaningless.
@end enumerate

To give you an idea of what the above rules look like in action, here's an
actual habit with some history:

@example
** TODO Shave
   SCHEDULED: <2009-10-17 Sat .+2d/4d>
   - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2009-10-15 Thu]
   - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2009-10-12 Mon]
   - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2009-10-10 Sat]
   - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2009-10-04 Sun]
   - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2009-10-02 Fri]
   - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2009-09-29 Tue]
   - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2009-09-25 Fri]
   - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2009-09-19 Sat]
   - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2009-09-16 Wed]
   - State "DONE"       from "TODO"       [2009-09-12 Sat]
   :PROPERTIES:
   :STYLE:    habit
   :LAST_REPEAT: [2009-10-19 Mon 00:36]
   :END:
@end example

What this habit says is: I want to shave at most every 2 days (given by the
@code{SCHEDULED} date and repeat interval) and at least every 4 days.  If
today is the 15th, then the habit first appears in the agenda on Oct 17,
after the minimum of 2 days has elapsed, and will appear overdue on Oct 19,
after four days have elapsed.

What's really useful about habits is that they are displayed along with a
consistency graph, to show how consistent you've been at getting that task
done in the past.  This graph shows every day that the task was done over the
past three weeks, with colors for each day.  The colors used are:

@table @code
@item Blue
If the task wasn't to be done yet on that day.
@item Green
If the task could have been done on that day.
@item Yellow
If the task was going to be overdue the next day.
@item Red
If the task was overdue on that day.
@end table

In addition to coloring each day, the day is also marked with an asterisk if
the task was actually done that day, and an exclamation mark to show where
the current day falls in the graph.

There are several configuration variables that can be used to change the way
habits are displayed in the agenda.

@table @code
@item org-habit-graph-column
The buffer column at which the consistency graph should be drawn.  This will
overwrite any text in that column, so it is a good idea to keep your habits'
titles brief and to the point.
@item org-habit-preceding-days
The amount of history, in days before today, to appear in consistency graphs.
@item org-habit-following-days
The number of days after today that will appear in consistency graphs.
@item org-habit-show-habits-only-for-today
If non-@code{nil}, only show habits in today's agenda view.  This is set to true by
default.
@end table

Lastly, pressing @kbd{K} in the agenda buffer will cause habits to
temporarily be disabled and they won't appear at all.  Press @kbd{K} again to
bring them back.  They are also subject to tag filtering, if you have habits
which should only be done in certain contexts, for example.

@node Priorities, Breaking down tasks, Progress logging, TODO Items
@section Priorities
@cindex priorities

If you use Org mode extensively, you may end up with enough TODO items that
it starts to make sense to prioritize them.  Prioritizing can be done by
placing a @emph{priority cookie} into the headline of a TODO item, like this

@example
*** TODO [#A] Write letter to Sam Fortune
@end example

@noindent
@vindex org-priority-faces
By default, Org mode supports three priorities: @samp{A}, @samp{B}, and
@samp{C}.  @samp{A} is the highest priority.  An entry without a cookie is
treated just like priority @samp{B}.  Priorities make a difference only for
sorting in the agenda (@pxref{Weekly/daily agenda}); outside the agenda, they
have no inherent meaning to Org mode.  The cookies can be highlighted with
special faces by customizing @code{org-priority-faces}.

Priorities can be attached to any outline node; they do not need to be TODO
items.

@table @kbd
@item @kbd{C-c ,}
@kindex @kbd{C-c ,}
@findex org-priority
Set the priority of the current headline (@command{org-priority}).  The
command prompts for a priority character @samp{A}, @samp{B} or @samp{C}.
When you press @key{SPC} instead, the priority cookie is removed from the
headline.  The priorities can also be changed ``remotely'' from the timeline
and agenda buffer with the @kbd{,} command (@pxref{Agenda commands}).
@c
@orgcmdkkcc{S-@key{up},S-@key{down},org-priority-up,org-priority-down}
@vindex org-priority-start-cycle-with-default
Increase/decrease priority of current headline@footnote{See also the option
@code{org-priority-start-cycle-with-default}.}.  Note that these keys are
also used to modify timestamps (@pxref{Creating timestamps}).  See also
@ref{Conflicts}, for a discussion of the interaction with
@code{shift-selection-mode}.
@end table

@vindex org-highest-priority
@vindex org-lowest-priority
@vindex org-default-priority
You can change the range of allowed priorities by setting the options
@code{org-highest-priority}, @code{org-lowest-priority}, and
@code{org-default-priority}.  For an individual buffer, you may set
these values (highest, lowest, default) like this (please make sure that
the highest priority is earlier in the alphabet than the lowest
priority):

@cindex #+PRIORITIES

#+PRIORITIES: A C B
@end example

@node Breaking down tasks, Checkboxes, Priorities, TODO Items
@section Breaking tasks down into subtasks
@cindex tasks, breaking down
@cindex statistics, for TODO items

@vindex org-agenda-todo-list-sublevels
It is often advisable to break down large tasks into smaller, manageable
subtasks.  You can do this by creating an outline tree below a TODO item,
with detailed subtasks on the tree@footnote{To keep subtasks out of the
global TODO list, see the @code{org-agenda-todo-list-sublevels}.}.  To keep
the overview over the fraction of subtasks that are already completed, insert
either @samp{[/]} or @samp{[%]} anywhere in the headline.  These cookies will
be updated each time the TODO status of a child changes, or when pressing
@kbd{C-c C-c} on the cookie.  For example:

@example
* Organize Party [33%]
** TODO Call people [1/2]
*** TODO Peter
*** DONE Sarah
** TODO Buy food
** DONE Talk to neighbor
@end example

@cindex property, COOKIE_DATA
If a heading has both checkboxes and TODO children below it, the meaning of
the statistics cookie become ambiguous.  Set the property
@code{COOKIE_DATA} to either @samp{checkbox} or @samp{todo} to resolve
this issue.

@vindex org-hierarchical-todo-statistics
If you would like to have the statistics cookie count any TODO entries in the
subtree (not just direct children), configure
@code{org-hierarchical-todo-statistics}.  To do this for a single subtree,
include the word @samp{recursive} into the value of the @code{COOKIE_DATA}
property.

@example
* Parent capturing statistics [2/20]
  :PROPERTIES:
  :COOKIE_DATA: todo recursive
  :END:
@end example

If you would like a TODO entry to automatically change to DONE
when all children are done, you can use the following setup:

@example
(defun org-summary-todo (n-done n-not-done)
  "Switch entry to DONE when all subentries are done, to TODO otherwise."
  (let (org-log-done org-log-states)   ; turn off logging
    (org-todo (if (= n-not-done 0) "DONE" "TODO"))))

(add-hook 'org-after-todo-statistics-hook 'org-summary-todo)
@end example


Another possibility is the use of checkboxes to identify (a hierarchy of) a
large number of subtasks (@pxref{Checkboxes}).


@node Checkboxes,  , Breaking down tasks, TODO Items
@section Checkboxes
@cindex checkboxes

@vindex org-list-automatic-rules
Every item in a plain list@footnote{With the exception of description
lists.  But you can allow it by modifying @code{org-list-automatic-rules}
accordingly.} (@pxref{Plain lists}) can be made into a checkbox by starting
it with the string @samp{[ ]}.  This feature is similar to TODO items
(@pxref{TODO Items}), but is more lightweight.  Checkboxes are not included
in the global TODO list, so they are often great to split a task into a
number of simple steps.  Or you can use them in a shopping list.  To toggle a
checkbox, use @kbd{C-c C-c}, or use the mouse (thanks to Piotr Zielinski's
@file{org-mouse.el}).

Here is an example of a checkbox list.

@example
* TODO Organize party [2/4]
  - [-] call people [1/3]
    - [ ] Peter
    - [X] Sarah
    - [ ] Sam
  - [X] order food
  - [ ] think about what music to play
  - [X] talk to the neighbors
@end example

Checkboxes work hierarchically, so if a checkbox item has children that
are checkboxes, toggling one of the children checkboxes will make the
parent checkbox reflect if none, some, or all of the children are
checked.

@cindex statistics, for checkboxes
@cindex checkbox statistics
@cindex property, COOKIE_DATA
@vindex org-checkbox-hierarchical-statistics
The @samp{[2/4]} and @samp{[1/3]} in the first and second line are cookies
indicating how many checkboxes present in this entry have been checked off,
and the total number of checkboxes present.  This can give you an idea on how
many checkboxes remain, even without opening a folded entry.  The cookies can
be placed into a headline or into (the first line of) a plain list item.
Each cookie covers checkboxes of direct children structurally below the
headline/item on which the cookie appears@footnote{Set the option
@code{org-checkbox-hierarchical-statistics} if you want such cookies to
count all checkboxes below the cookie, not just those belonging to direct
children.}.  You have to insert the cookie yourself by typing either
@samp{[/]} or @samp{[%]}.  With @samp{[/]} you get an @samp{n out of m}
result, as in the examples above.  With @samp{[%]} you get information about
the percentage of checkboxes checked (in the above example, this would be
@samp{[50%]} and @samp{[33%]}, respectively).  In a headline, a cookie can
count either checkboxes below the heading or TODO states of children, and it
will display whatever was changed last.  Set the property @code{COOKIE_DATA}
to either @samp{checkbox} or @samp{todo} to resolve this issue.

@cindex blocking, of checkboxes
@cindex checkbox blocking
@cindex property, ORDERED
If the current outline node has an @code{ORDERED} property, checkboxes must
be checked off in sequence, and an error will be thrown if you try to check
off a box while there are unchecked boxes above it.

@noindent The following commands work with checkboxes:

@table @kbd
@orgcmd{C-c C-c,org-toggle-checkbox}
Toggle checkbox status or (with prefix arg) checkbox presence at point.
With a single prefix argument, add an empty checkbox or remove the current
one@footnote{@kbd{C-u C-c C-c} on the @emph{first} item of a list with no checkbox
will add checkboxes to the rest of the list.}.  With a double prefix argument, set it to @samp{[-]}, which is
considered to be an intermediate state.
@orgcmd{C-c C-x C-b,org-toggle-checkbox}
Toggle checkbox status or (with prefix arg) checkbox presence at point.  With
double prefix argument, set it to @samp{[-]}, which is considered to be an
intermediate state.
@itemize @minus
@item
If there is an active region, toggle the first checkbox in the region
and set all remaining boxes to the same status as the first.  With a prefix
arg, add or remove the checkbox for all items in the region.
@item
If the cursor is in a headline, toggle checkboxes in the region between
this headline and the next (so @emph{not} the entire subtree).
@item
If there is no active region, just toggle the checkbox at point.
@end itemize
@orgcmd{M-S-@key{RET},org-insert-todo-heading}
Insert a new item with a checkbox.  This works only if the cursor is already
in a plain list item (@pxref{Plain lists}).
@orgcmd{C-c C-x o,org-toggle-ordered-property}
@vindex org-track-ordered-property-with-tag
@cindex property, ORDERED
Toggle the @code{ORDERED} property of the entry, to toggle if checkboxes must
be checked off in sequence.  A property is used for this behavior because
this should be local to the current entry, not inherited like a tag.
However, if you would like to @i{track} the value of this property with a tag
for better visibility, customize @code{org-track-ordered-property-with-tag}.
@orgcmd{C-c #,org-update-statistics-cookies}
Update the statistics cookie in the current outline entry.  When called with
a @kbd{C-u} prefix, update the entire file.  Checkbox statistic cookies are
updated automatically if you toggle checkboxes with @kbd{C-c C-c} and make
new ones with @kbd{M-S-@key{RET}}.  TODO statistics cookies update when
changing TODO states.  If you delete boxes/entries or add/change them by
hand, use this command to get things back into sync.

An excellent way to implement labels and contexts for cross-correlating
information is to assign @i{tags} to headlines.  Org mode has extensive
support for tags.

@vindex org-tag-faces
Every headline can contain a list of tags; they occur at the end of the
headline.  Tags are normal words containing letters, numbers, @samp{_}, and
@samp{@@}.  Tags must be preceded and followed by a single colon, e.g.,
@samp{:work:}.  Several tags can be specified, as in @samp{:work:urgent:}.
Tags will by default be in bold face with the same color as the headline.
You may specify special faces for specific tags using the option
@code{org-tag-faces}, in much the same way as you can for TODO keywords
(@pxref{Faces for TODO keywords}).

@section Tag inheritance
@cindex tag inheritance
@cindex inheritance, of tags
@cindex sublevels, inclusion into tags match

@i{Tags} make use of the hierarchical structure of outline trees.  If a
heading has a certain tag, all subheadings will inherit the tag as
well.  For example, in the list

@example
* Meeting with the French group      :work:
** Summary by Frank                  :boss:notes:
*** TODO Prepare slides for him      :action:
@end example

@noindent
the final heading will have the tags @samp{:work:}, @samp{:boss:},
@samp{:notes:}, and @samp{:action:} even though the final heading is not
explicitly marked with those tags.  You can also set tags that all entries in
a file should inherit just as if these tags were defined in a hypothetical
level zero that surrounds the entire file.  Use a line like this@footnote{As
with all these in-buffer settings, pressing @kbd{C-c C-c} activates any
changes in the line.}:

@cindex #+FILETAGS
@example
#+FILETAGS: :Peter:Boss:Secret:
@end example

@noindent
@vindex org-use-tag-inheritance
@vindex org-tags-exclude-from-inheritance
To limit tag inheritance to specific tags, use @code{org-tags-exclude-from-inheritance}.
To turn it off entirely, use @code{org-use-tag-inheritance}.

@vindex org-tags-match-list-sublevels
When a headline matches during a tags search while tag inheritance is turned
on, all the sublevels in the same tree will (for a simple match form) match
as well@footnote{This is only true if the search does not involve more
complex tests including properties (@pxref{Property searches}).}.  The list
of matches may then become very long.  If you only want to see the first tags
match in a subtree, configure @code{org-tags-match-list-sublevels} (not
recommended).

@vindex org-agenda-use-tag-inheritance
Tag inheritance is relevant when the agenda search tries to match a tag,
either in the @code{tags} or @code{tags-todo} agenda types.  In other agenda
types, @code{org-use-tag-inheritance} has no effect.  Still, you may want to
have your tags correctly set in the agenda, so that tag filtering works fine,
with inherited tags.  Set @code{org-agenda-use-tag-inheritance} to control
this: the default value includes all agenda types, but setting this to @code{nil}
can really speed up agenda generation.

@node Setting tags, Tag groups, Tag inheritance, Tags

@kindex M-@key{TAB}
Tags can simply be typed into the buffer at the end of a headline.
After a colon, @kbd{M-@key{TAB}} offers completion on tags.  There is
also a special command for inserting tags:

@table @kbd
@orgcmd{C-c C-q,org-set-tags-command}
@cindex completion, of tags
@vindex org-tags-column
Enter new tags for the current headline.  Org mode will either offer
completion or a special single-key interface for setting tags, see
below.  After pressing @key{RET}, the tags will be inserted and aligned
to @code{org-tags-column}.  When called with a @kbd{C-u} prefix, all
tags in the current buffer will be aligned to that column, just to make
things look nice.  TAGS are automatically realigned after promotion,
demotion, and TODO state changes (@pxref{TODO basics}).

@orgcmd{C-c C-c,org-set-tags-command}
When the cursor is in a headline, this does the same as @kbd{C-c C-q}.
@end table

@vindex org-tag-alist
Org supports tag insertion based on a @emph{list of tags}.  By
default this list is constructed dynamically, containing all tags
currently used in the buffer.  You may also globally specify a hard list
of tags with the variable @code{org-tag-alist}.  Finally you can set
the default tags for a given file with lines like

@cindex #+TAGS
@example
#+TAGS: @@work @@home @@tennisclub
#+TAGS: laptop car pc sailboat
@end example

If you have globally defined your preferred set of tags using the
variable @code{org-tag-alist}, but would like to use a dynamic tag list
in a specific file, add an empty TAGS option line to that file:

@example
#+TAGS:
@end example

@vindex org-tag-persistent-alist
If you have a preferred set of tags that you would like to use in every file,
in addition to those defined on a per-file basis by TAGS option lines, then
you may specify a list of tags with the variable
@code{org-tag-persistent-alist}.  You may turn this off on a per-file basis
by adding a STARTUP option line to that file:

@example
#+STARTUP: noptag
@end example

By default Org mode uses the standard minibuffer completion facilities for
entering tags.  However, it also implements another, quicker, tag selection
method called @emph{fast tag selection}.  This allows you to select and
deselect tags with just a single key press.  For this to work well you should
assign unique letters to most of your commonly used tags.  You can do this
globally by configuring the variable @code{org-tag-alist} in your
@file{.emacs} file.  For example, you may find the need to tag many items in
different files with @samp{:@@home:}.  In this case you can set something
like:

@lisp
(setq org-tag-alist '(("@@work" . ?w) ("@@home" . ?h) ("laptop" . ?l)))
@end lisp

@noindent If the tag is only relevant to the file you are working on, then you
can instead set the TAGS option line as:

@example
#+TAGS: @@work(w)  @@home(h)  @@tennisclub(t)  laptop(l)  pc(p)
@end example

@noindent The tags interface will show the available tags in a splash
window.  If you want to start a new line after a specific tag, insert
@samp{\n} into the tag list

@example
#+TAGS: @@work(w)  @@home(h)  @@tennisclub(t) \n laptop(l)  pc(p)
@end example

@noindent or write them in two lines:

@example
#+TAGS: @@work(w)  @@home(h)  @@tennisclub(t)
#+TAGS: laptop(l)  pc(p)
@end example

@noindent
You can also group together tags that are mutually exclusive by using
braces, as in:

@example
#+TAGS: @{ @@work(w)  @@home(h)  @@tennisclub(t) @}  laptop(l)  pc(p)
@end example

@noindent you indicate that at most one of @samp{@@work}, @samp{@@home},
and @samp{@@tennisclub} should be selected.  Multiple such groups are allowed.

@noindent Don't forget to press @kbd{C-c C-c} with the cursor in one of
these lines to activate any changes.

@noindent
To set these mutually exclusive groups in the variable @code{org-tag-alist},
you must use the dummy tags @code{:startgroup} and @code{:endgroup} instead
of the braces.  Similarly, you can use @code{:newline} to indicate a line
break.  The previous example would be set globally by the following
configuration:

@lisp
(setq org-tag-alist '((:startgroup . nil)
                      ("@@work" . ?w) ("@@home" . ?h)
                      ("@@tennisclub" . ?t)
                      (:endgroup . nil)
                      ("laptop" . ?l) ("pc" . ?p)))
@end lisp

If at least one tag has a selection key then pressing @kbd{C-c C-c} will
automatically present you with a special interface, listing inherited tags,
the tags of the current headline, and a list of all valid tags with
corresponding keys@footnote{Keys will automatically be assigned to tags which
have no configured keys.}.  In this interface, you can use the following
keys:

@table @kbd
@item a-z...
Pressing keys assigned to tags will add or remove them from the list of
tags in the current line.  Selecting a tag in a group of mutually
exclusive tags will turn off any other tags from that group.
@kindex @key{TAB}
@item @key{TAB}
Enter a tag in the minibuffer, even if the tag is not in the predefined
list.  You will be able to complete on all tags present in the buffer.
You can also add several tags: just separate them with a comma.

@kindex @key{SPC}
@item @key{SPC}
Clear all tags for this line.
@kindex @key{RET}
@item @key{RET}
Accept the modified set.
@item C-g
Abort without installing changes.
@item q
If @kbd{q} is not assigned to a tag, it aborts like @kbd{C-g}.
@item !
Turn off groups of mutually exclusive tags.  Use this to (as an
exception) assign several tags from such a group.
@item C-c
Toggle auto-exit after the next change (see below).
If you are using expert mode, the first @kbd{C-c} will display the
selection window.
@end table

@noindent
This method lets you assign tags to a headline with very few keys.  With
the above setup, you could clear the current tags and set @samp{@@home},
@samp{laptop} and @samp{pc} tags with just the following keys: @kbd{C-c
C-c @key{SPC} h l p @key{RET}}.  Switching from @samp{@@home} to
@samp{@@work} would be done with @kbd{C-c C-c w @key{RET}} or
alternatively with @kbd{C-c C-c C-c w}.  Adding the non-predefined tag
@samp{Sarah} could be done with @kbd{C-c C-c @key{TAB} S a r a h
@key{RET} @key{RET}}.

@vindex org-fast-tag-selection-single-key
If you find that most of the time you need only a single key press to
modify your list of tags, set @code{org-fast-tag-selection-single-key}.
Then you no longer have to press @key{RET} to exit fast tag selection---it
will immediately exit after the first change.  If you then occasionally
need more keys, press @kbd{C-c} to turn off auto-exit for the current tag
selection process (in effect: start selection with @kbd{C-c C-c C-c}
instead of @kbd{C-c C-c}).  If you set the variable to the value
@code{expert}, the special window is not even shown for single-key tag
selection, it comes up only when you press an extra @kbd{C-c}.

@node Tag groups, Tag searches, Setting tags, Tags
@section Tag groups

@cindex group tags
@cindex tags, groups
In a set of mutually exclusive tags, the first tag can be defined as a
@emph{group tag}.  When you search for a group tag, it will return matches
for all members in the group.  In an agenda view, filtering by a group tag
will display headlines tagged with at least one of the members of the
group.  This makes tag searches and filters even more flexible.

You can set group tags by inserting a colon between the group tag and other
tags---beware that all whitespaces are mandatory so that Org can parse this
line correctly:

@example
#+TAGS: @{ @@read : @@read_book @@read_ebook @}
@end example

In this example, @samp{@@read} is a @emph{group tag} for a set of three
tags: @samp{@@read}, @samp{@@read_book} and @samp{@@read_ebook}.

You can also use the @code{:grouptags} keyword directly when setting
@code{org-tag-alist}:

@lisp
(setq org-tag-alist '((:startgroup . nil)
                      ("@@read" . nil)
                      (:grouptags . nil)
                      ("@@read_book" . nil)
                      ("@@read_ebook" . nil)
                      (:endgroup . nil)))
@end lisp

You cannot nest group tags or use a group tag as a tag in another group.

@kindex C-c C-x q
@vindex org-group-tags
If you want to ignore group tags temporarily, toggle group tags support
with @command{org-toggle-tags-groups}, bound to @kbd{C-c C-x q}.  If you
want to disable tag groups completely, set @code{org-group-tags} to @code{nil}.

@node Tag searches,  , Tag groups, Tags
@section Tag searches

Once a system of tags has been set up, it can be used to collect related
information into special lists.

@table @kbd
@orgcmdkkc{C-c / m,C-c \\,org-match-sparse-tree}
Create a sparse tree with all headlines matching a tags/property/TODO search.
With a @kbd{C-u} prefix argument, ignore headlines that are not a TODO line.

@vindex org-tags-match-list-sublevels
Create a global list of tag matches from all agenda files, but check
only TODO items and force checking subitems (see the option
@code{org-tags-match-list-sublevels}).
@end table

These commands all prompt for a match string which allows basic Boolean logic
like @samp{+boss+urgent-project1}, to find entries with tags @samp{boss} and
@samp{urgent}, but not @samp{project1}, or @samp{Kathy|Sally} to find entries
which are tagged, like @samp{Kathy} or @samp{Sally}.  The full syntax of the search
string is rich and allows also matching against TODO keywords, entry levels
and properties.  For a complete description with many examples, see
@ref{Matching tags and properties}.


@node Properties and Columns, Dates and Times, Tags, Top
@chapter Properties and columns
@cindex properties

A property is a key-value pair associated with an entry.  Properties can be
set so they are associated with a single entry, with every entry in a tree,
or with every entry in an Org mode file.

There are two main applications for properties in Org mode.  First,
properties are like tags, but with a value.  Imagine maintaining a file where
you document bugs and plan releases for a piece of software.  Instead of
using tags like @code{:release_1:}, @code{:release_2:}, you can use a
property, say @code{:Release:}, that in different subtrees has different
values, such as @code{1.0} or @code{2.0}.  Second, you can use properties to
implement (very basic) database capabilities in an Org buffer.  Imagine
keeping track of your music CDs, where properties could be things such as the
album, artist, date of release, number of tracks, and so on.

Properties can be conveniently edited and viewed in column view
(@pxref{Column view}).

@cindex drawer, for properties

Properties are key-value pairs.  When they are associated with a single entry
or with a tree they need to be inserted into a special
drawer (@pxref{Drawers}) with the name @code{PROPERTIES}.  Each property
is specified on a single line, with the key (surrounded by colons)
first, and the value after it.  Here is an example:

@example
* CD collection
** Classic
*** Goldberg Variations
    :PROPERTIES:
    :Title:     Goldberg Variations
    :Composer:  J.S. Bach
    :Artist:    Glen Gould
    :Publisher: Deutsche Grammophon
    :NDisks:    1
    :END:
@end example

Depending on the value of @code{org-use-property-inheritance}, a property set
this way will either be associated with a single entry, or the sub-tree
defined by the entry, see @ref{Property inheritance}.

You may define the allowed values for a particular property @samp{:Xyz:}
by setting a property @samp{:Xyz_ALL:}.  This special property is
@emph{inherited}, so if you set it in a level 1 entry, it will apply to
the entire tree.  When allowed values are defined, setting the
corresponding property becomes easier and is less prone to typing
errors.  For the example with the CD collection, we can predefine
publishers and the number of disks in a box like this:

@example
* CD collection
  :PROPERTIES:
  :NDisks_ALL:  1 2 3 4
  :Publisher_ALL: "Deutsche Grammophon" Philips EMI
  :END:
@end example

If you want to set properties that can be inherited by any entry in a
file, use a line like
@cindex property, _ALL
@cindex #+PROPERTY
@example
#+PROPERTY: NDisks_ALL 1 2 3 4
@end example

Contrary to properties set from a special drawer, you have to refresh the
buffer with @kbd{C-c C-c} to activate this changes.

If you want to add to the value of an existing property, append a @code{+} to
the property name.  The following results in the property @code{var} having
the value ``foo=1 bar=2''.
@cindex property, +
@example
#+PROPERTY: var  foo=1
#+PROPERTY: var+ bar=2
@end example

It is also possible to add to the values of inherited properties.  The
following results in the @code{genres} property having the value ``Classic
Baroque'' under the @code{Goldberg Variations} subtree.
@cindex property, +
@example
* CD collection
** Classic
    :PROPERTIES:
    :GENRES: Classic
    :END:
*** Goldberg Variations
    :PROPERTIES:
    :Title:     Goldberg Variations
    :Composer:  J.S. Bach
    :Artist:    Glen Gould
    :Publisher: Deutsche Grammophon
    :NDisks:    1
    :GENRES+:   Baroque
    :END:
@end example
Note that a property can only have one entry per Drawer.

@vindex org-global-properties
Property values set with the global variable
@code{org-global-properties} can be inherited by all entries in all

The following commands help to work with properties:

@table @kbd

After an initial colon in a line, complete property keys.  All keys used
in the current file will be offered as possible completions.
@orgcmd{C-c C-x p,org-set-property}
Set a property.  This prompts for a property name and a value.  If
necessary, the property drawer is created as well.
@item C-u M-x org-insert-drawer RET
@cindex org-insert-drawer
Insert a property drawer into the current entry.  The drawer will be
inserted early in the entry, but after the lines with planning
information like deadlines.
@orgcmd{C-c C-c,org-property-action}
With the cursor in a property drawer, this executes property commands.
@orgcmd{C-c C-c s,org-set-property}
Set a property in the current entry.  Both the property and the value
can be inserted using completion.
@orgcmdkkcc{S-@key{right},S-@key{left},org-property-next-allowed-value,org-property-previous-allowed-value}

Special properties provide an alternative access method to Org mode features,
like the TODO state or the priority of an entry, discussed in the previous
chapters.  This interface exists so that you can include these states in a

The syntax for the search string is described in @ref{Matching tags and

There is also a special command for creating sparse trees based on a
single property:

@table @kbd
@orgkey{C-c / p}
Create a sparse tree based on the value of a property.  This first
prompts for the name of a property, and then for a value.  A sparse tree
is created with all entries that define this property with the given
value.  If you enclose the value in curly braces, it is interpreted as
a regular expression and matched against the property values.

@vindex org-use-property-inheritance
The outline structure of Org mode documents lends itself to an
inheritance model of properties: if the parent in a tree has a certain
property, the children can inherit this property.  Org mode does not
turn this on by default, because it can slow down property searches
significantly and is often not needed.  However, if you find inheritance
useful, you can turn it on by setting the variable
@code{org-use-property-inheritance}.  It may be set to @code{t} to make
all properties inherited from the parent, to a list of properties
that should be inherited, or to a regular expression that matches
inherited properties.  If a property has the value @code{nil}, this is
interpreted as an explicit undefine of the property, so that inheritance
search will stop at this value and return @code{nil}.

Org mode has a few properties for which inheritance is hard-coded, at
least for the special applications for which they are used:

@cindex property, COLUMNS
@table @code
@item COLUMNS
The @code{:COLUMNS:} property defines the format of column view
(@pxref{Column view}).  It is inherited in the sense that the level
where a @code{:COLUMNS:} property is defined is used as the starting
point for a column view table, independently of the location in the
subtree from where columns view is turned on.
@item CATEGORY
@cindex property, CATEGORY
For agenda view, a category set through a @code{:CATEGORY:} property
applies to the entire subtree.
@item ARCHIVE
@cindex property, ARCHIVE
For archiving, the @code{:ARCHIVE:} property may define the archive
location for the entire subtree (@pxref{Moving subtrees}).
@item LOGGING
@cindex property, LOGGING
The LOGGING property may define logging settings for an entry or a
subtree (@pxref{Tracking TODO state changes}).
@end table

@node Column view, Property API, Property inheritance, Properties and Columns

A great way to view and edit properties in an outline tree is
@emph{column view}.  In column view, each outline node is turned into a
table row.  Columns in this table provide access to properties of the
entries.  Org mode implements columns by overlaying a tabular structure
over the headline of each item.  While the headlines have been turned
into a table row, you can still change the visibility of the outline
tree.  For example, you get a compact table by switching to CONTENTS
view (@kbd{S-@key{TAB} S-@key{TAB}}, or simply @kbd{c} while column view
is active), but you can still open, read, and edit the entry below each
headline.  Or, you can switch to column view after executing a sparse
tree command and in this way get a table only for the selected items.
Column view also works in agenda buffers (@pxref{Agenda Views}) where
queries have collected selected items, possibly from a number of files.

Setting up a column view first requires defining the columns.  This is
done by defining a column format line.

* Column attributes::           Appearance and content of a column
@end menu

@node Scope of column definitions, Column attributes, Defining columns, Defining columns
@subsubsection Scope of column definitions

To define a column format for an entire file, use a line like

@cindex #+COLUMNS
@example
#+COLUMNS: %25ITEM %TAGS %PRIORITY %TODO
@end example

To specify a format that only applies to a specific tree, add a
@code{:COLUMNS:} property to the top node of that tree, for example:

@example
** Top node for columns view
   :PROPERTIES:
   :COLUMNS: %25ITEM %TAGS %PRIORITY %TODO
   :END:
@end example

If a @code{:COLUMNS:} property is present in an entry, it defines columns
for the entry itself, and for the entire subtree below it.  Since the
column definition is part of the hierarchical structure of the document,
you can define columns on level 1 that are general enough for all
sublevels, and more specific columns further down, when you edit a
deeper part of the tree.

@node Column attributes,  , Scope of column definitions, Defining columns
@subsubsection Column attributes
A column definition sets the attributes of a column.  The general
definition looks like this:

@example
 %[@var{width}]@var{property}[(@var{title})][@{@var{summary-type}@}]
@end example

@noindent
Except for the percent sign and the property name, all items are
optional.  The individual parts have the following meaning:

@example
@var{width}           @r{An integer specifying the width of the column in characters.}
                @r{If omitted, the width will be determined automatically.}
@var{property}        @r{The property that should be edited in this column.}
                @r{Special properties representing meta data are allowed here}
                @r{as well (@pxref{Special properties})}
@var{title}           @r{The header text for the column.  If omitted, the property}
                @r{name is used.}
@{@var{summary-type}@}  @r{The summary type.  If specified, the column values for}
                @r{parent nodes are computed from the children.}
                @r{Supported summary types are:}
                @{+@}       @r{Sum numbers in this column.}
                @{+;%.1f@}  @r{Like @samp{+}, but format result with @samp{%.1f}.}
                @{$@}       @r{Currency, short for @samp{+;%.2f}.}
                @{:@}       @r{Sum times, HH:MM, plain numbers are hours.}
                @{X@}       @r{Checkbox status, @samp{[X]} if all children are @samp{[X]}.}
                @{X/@}      @r{Checkbox status, @samp{[n/m]}.}
                @{X%@}      @r{Checkbox status, @samp{[n%]}.}
                @{min@}     @r{Smallest number in column.}
                @{max@}     @r{Largest number.}
                @{mean@}    @r{Arithmetic mean of numbers.}
                @{:min@}    @r{Smallest time value in column.}
                @{:max@}    @r{Largest time value.}
                @{:mean@}   @r{Arithmetic mean of time values.}
                @{@@min@}    @r{Minimum age (in days/hours/mins/seconds).}
                @{@@max@}    @r{Maximum age (in days/hours/mins/seconds).}
                @{@@mean@}   @r{Arithmetic mean of ages (in days/hours/mins/seconds).}
                @{est+@}    @r{Add low-high estimates.}
@end example

@noindent
Be aware that you can only have one summary type for any property you
include.  Subsequent columns referencing the same property will all display the
same summary information.

The @code{est+} summary type requires further explanation.  It is used for
combining estimates, expressed as low-high ranges.  For example, instead
of estimating a particular task will take 5 days, you might estimate it as
5--6 days if you're fairly confident you know how much work is required, or
1--10 days if you don't really know what needs to be done.  Both ranges
average at 5.5 days, but the first represents a more predictable delivery.

When combining a set of such estimates, simply adding the lows and highs
produces an unrealistically wide result.  Instead, @code{est+} adds the
statistical mean and variance of the sub-tasks, generating a final estimate
from the sum.  For example, suppose you had ten tasks, each of which was
estimated at 0.5 to 2 days of work.  Straight addition produces an estimate
of 5 to 20 days, representing what to expect if everything goes either
extremely well or extremely poorly.  In contrast, @code{est+} estimates the
full job more realistically, at 10--15 days.

Numbers are right-aligned when a format specifier with an explicit width like
@code{%5d} or @code{%5.1f} is used.

Here is an example for a complete columns definition, along with allowed
values.

@example
:COLUMNS:  %25ITEM %9Approved(Approved?)@{X@} %Owner %11Status \@footnote{Please note that the COLUMNS definition must be on a single line---it is wrapped here only because of formatting constraints.}
                   %10Time_Estimate@{:@} %CLOCKSUM %CLOCKSUM_T
:Owner_ALL:    Tammy Mark Karl Lisa Don
:Status_ALL:   "In progress" "Not started yet" "Finished" ""
:Approved_ALL: "[ ]" "[X]"
@end example

@noindent
The first column, @samp{%25ITEM}, means the first 25 characters of the
item itself, i.e., of the headline.  You probably always should start the
column definition with the @samp{ITEM} specifier.  The other specifiers
create columns @samp{Owner} with a list of names as allowed values, for
@samp{Status} with four different possible values, and for a checkbox
field @samp{Approved}.  When no width is given after the @samp{%}
character, the column will be exactly as wide as it needs to be in order
to fully display all values.  The @samp{Approved} column does have a
modified title (@samp{Approved?}, with a question mark).  Summaries will
be created for the @samp{Time_Estimate} column by adding time duration
expressions like HH:MM, and for the @samp{Approved} column, by providing
an @samp{[X]} status if all children have been checked.  The
@samp{CLOCKSUM} and @samp{CLOCKSUM_T} columns are special, they lists the
sums of CLOCK intervals in the subtree, either for all clocks or just for
today.

@subsection Using column view

@table @kbd
@tsubheading{Turning column view on and off}
@orgcmd{C-c C-x C-c,org-columns}
@vindex org-columns-default-format
Turn on column view.  If the cursor is before the first headline in the file,
column view is turned on for the entire file, using the @code{#+COLUMNS}
definition.  If the cursor is somewhere inside the outline, this command
searches the hierarchy, up from point, for a @code{:COLUMNS:} property that
defines a format.  When one is found, the column view table is established
for the tree starting at the entry that contains the @code{:COLUMNS:}
property.  If no such property is found, the format is taken from the
@code{#+COLUMNS} line or from the variable @code{org-columns-default-format},
and column view is established for the current entry and its subtree.
@orgcmd{r,org-columns-redo}
Recreate the column view, to include recent changes made in the buffer.
@orgcmd{g,org-columns-redo}
Same as @kbd{r}.
@orgcmd{q,org-columns-quit}
Exit column view.
@tsubheading{Editing values}
@item @key{left} @key{right} @key{up} @key{down}
Move through the column view from field to field.
@kindex S-@key{left}
@kindex S-@key{right}
@item  S-@key{left}/@key{right}
Switch to the next/previous allowed value of the field.  For this, you
have to have specified allowed values for a property.
@item 1..9,0
Directly select the Nth allowed value, @kbd{0} selects the 10th value.
@orgcmdkkcc{n,p,org-columns-next-allowed-value,org-columns-previous-allowed-value}
Same as @kbd{S-@key{left}/@key{right}}
@orgcmd{e,org-columns-edit-value}
Edit the property at point.  For the special properties, this will
invoke the same interface that you normally use to change that
property.  For example, when editing a TAGS property, the tag completion
or fast selection interface will pop up.
@orgcmd{C-c C-c,org-columns-set-tags-or-toggle}
When there is a checkbox at point, toggle it.
@orgcmd{v,org-columns-show-value}
View the full value of this property.  This is useful if the width of
the column is smaller than that of the value.
@orgcmd{a,org-columns-edit-allowed}
Edit the list of allowed values for this property.  If the list is found
in the hierarchy, the modified values is stored there.  If no list is
found, the new value is stored in the first entry that is part of the
current column view.
@tsubheading{Modifying the table structure}
@orgcmdkkcc{<,>,org-columns-narrow,org-columns-widen}
Make the column narrower/wider by one character.
@orgcmd{S-M-@key{right},org-columns-new}

@node Capturing column view,  , Using column view, Column view
@subsection Capturing column view

Since column view is just an overlay over a buffer, it cannot be
exported or printed directly.  If you want to capture a column view, use
a @code{columnview} dynamic block (@pxref{Dynamic blocks}).  The frame
of this block looks like this:

@cindex #+BEGIN, columnview
@example
* The column view
#+BEGIN: columnview :hlines 1 :id "label"

#+END:
@end example

@noindent This dynamic block has the following parameters:

@table @code
@item :id
This is the most important parameter.  Column view is a feature that is
often localized to a certain (sub)tree, and the capture block might be
at a different location in the file.  To identify the tree whose view to
capture, you can use 4 values:
@cindex property, ID
@example
local     @r{use the tree in which the capture block is located}
global    @r{make a global view, including all headings in the file}
"file:@var{path-to-file}"
          @r{run column view at the top of this file}
"@var{ID}"      @r{call column view in the tree that has an @code{:ID:}}
          @r{property with the value @i{label}.  You can use}
          @r{@kbd{M-x org-id-copy RET} to create a globally unique ID for}
          @r{the current entry and copy it to the kill-ring.}
@end example
@item :hlines
When @code{t}, insert an hline after every line.  When a number @var{N}, insert
an hline before each headline with level @code{<= @var{N}}.
@item :vlines
When set to @code{t}, force column groups to get vertical lines.
@item :maxlevel
When set to a number, don't capture entries below this level.
@item :skip-empty-rows
When set to @code{t}, skip rows where the only non-empty specifier of the
column view is @code{ITEM}.

@end table

@noindent
The following commands insert or update the dynamic block:

@table @kbd
@orgcmd{C-c C-x i,org-insert-columns-dblock}
Insert a dynamic block capturing a column view.  You will be prompted
for the scope or ID of the view.
@orgcmdkkc{C-c C-c,C-c C-x C-u,org-dblock-update}
Update dynamic block at point.  The cursor needs to be in the
@code{#+BEGIN} line of the dynamic block.
@orgcmd{C-u C-c C-x C-u,org-update-all-dblocks}
Update all dynamic blocks (@pxref{Dynamic blocks}).  This is useful if
you have several clock table blocks, column-capturing blocks or other dynamic
blocks in a buffer.
@end table

You can add formulas to the column view table and you may add plotting
instructions in front of the table---these will survive an update of the
block.  If there is a @code{#+TBLFM:} after the table, the table will
actually be recalculated automatically after an update.

An alternative way to capture and process property values into a table is
provided by Eric Schulte's @file{org-collector.el} which is a contributed
package@footnote{Contributed packages are not part of Emacs, but are
distributed with the main distribution of Org (visit
@uref{http://orgmode.org}).}.  It provides a general API to collect
properties from entries in a certain scope, and arbitrary Lisp expressions to
process these values before inserting them into a table or a dynamic block.

To assist project planning, TODO items can be labeled with a date and/or
a time.  The specially formatted string carrying the date and time
information is called a @emph{timestamp} in Org mode.  This may be a
little confusing because timestamp is often used as indicating when
something was created or last changed.  However, in Org mode this term
is used in a much wider sense.

A timestamp is a specification of a date (possibly with a time or a range of
times) in a special format, either @samp{<2003-09-16 Tue>}@footnote{In this
simplest form, the day name is optional when you type the date yourself.
However, any dates inserted or modified by Org will add that day name, for
reading convenience.} or @samp{<2003-09-16 Tue 09:39>} or @samp{<2003-09-16
Tue 12:00-12:30>}@footnote{This is inspired by the standard ISO 8601
date/time format.  To use an alternative format, see @ref{Custom time
format}.}.  A timestamp can appear anywhere in the headline or body of an Org
tree entry.  Its presence causes entries to be shown on specific dates in the
agenda (@pxref{Weekly/daily agenda}).  We distinguish:

@table @var
@item Plain timestamp; Event; Appointment
@cindex timestamp
@cindex appointment
A simple timestamp just assigns a date/time to an item.  This is just
like writing down an appointment or event in a paper agenda.  In the
timeline and agenda displays, the headline of an entry associated with a
plain timestamp will be shown exactly on that date.

@example
* Meet Peter at the movies
  <2006-11-01 Wed 19:15>
* Discussion on climate change
  <2006-11-02 Thu 20:00-22:00>
@end example

@item Timestamp with repeater interval
@cindex timestamp, with repeater interval
A timestamp may contain a @emph{repeater interval}, indicating that it
applies not only on the given date, but again and again after a certain
interval of N days (d), weeks (w), months (m), or years (y).  The
following will show up in the agenda every Wednesday:

@example
* Pick up Sam at school
  <2007-05-16 Wed 12:30 +1w>
@end example

@item Diary-style sexp entries
For more complex date specifications, Org mode supports using the special
sexp diary entries implemented in the Emacs calendar/diary
package@footnote{When working with the standard diary sexp functions, you
need to be very careful with the order of the arguments.  That order depend
evilly on the variable @code{calendar-date-style} (or, for older Emacs
versions, @code{european-calendar-style}).  For example, to specify a date
December 12, 2005, the call might look like @code{(diary-date 12 1 2005)} or
@code{(diary-date 1 12 2005)} or @code{(diary-date 2005 12 1)}, depending on
the settings.  This has been the source of much confusion.  Org mode users
can resort to special versions of these functions like @code{org-date} or
@code{org-anniversary}.  These work just like the corresponding @code{diary-}
functions, but with stable ISO order of arguments (year, month, day) wherever
applicable, independent of the value of @code{calendar-date-style}.}.  For
example with optional time

@example
* 22:00-23:00 The nerd meeting on every 2nd Thursday of the month
  <%%(diary-float t 4 2)>
@end example

@item Time/Date range
@cindex timerange
@cindex date range
Two timestamps connected by @samp{--} denote a range.  The headline
will be shown on the first and last day of the range, and on any dates
that are displayed and fall in the range.  Here is an example:

@example
** Meeting in Amsterdam
   <2004-08-23 Mon>--<2004-08-26 Thu>
@end example

@item Inactive timestamp
@cindex timestamp, inactive
@cindex inactive timestamp
Just like a plain timestamp, but with square brackets instead of
angular ones.  These timestamps are inactive in the sense that they do
@emph{not} trigger an entry to show up in the agenda.

@example
* Gillian comes late for the fifth time
  [2006-11-01 Wed]
@end example

For Org mode to recognize timestamps, they need to be in the specific
format.  All commands listed below produce timestamps in the correct
format.

@table @kbd
@orgcmd{C-c .,org-time-stamp}
Prompt for a date and insert a corresponding timestamp.  When the cursor is
at an existing timestamp in the buffer, the command is used to modify this
timestamp instead of inserting a new one.  When this command is used twice in
succession, a time range is inserted.
@c
@orgcmd{C-c !,org-time-stamp-inactive}
Like @kbd{C-c .}, but insert an inactive timestamp that will not cause
an agenda entry.
@c
@kindex C-u C-c .
@kindex C-u C-c !
@item C-u C-c .
@itemx C-u C-c !
@vindex org-time-stamp-rounding-minutes
Like @kbd{C-c .} and @kbd{C-c !}, but use the alternative format which
contains date and time.  The default time can be rounded to multiples of 5
minutes, see the option @code{org-time-stamp-rounding-minutes}.
@c
@orgkey{C-c C-c}
Normalize timestamp, insert/fix day name if missing or wrong.
@c
@orgcmd{C-c <,org-date-from-calendar}
Insert a timestamp corresponding to the cursor date in the Calendar.
@c
@orgcmd{C-c >,org-goto-calendar}
Access the Emacs calendar for the current date.  If there is a
timestamp in the current line, go to the corresponding date
instead.
@c
@orgcmd{C-c C-o,org-open-at-point}
Access the agenda for the date given by the timestamp or -range at
point (@pxref{Weekly/daily agenda}).
@c
@orgcmdkkcc{S-@key{left},S-@key{right},org-timestamp-down-day,org-timestamp-up-day}
Change date at cursor by one day.  These key bindings conflict with
shift-selection and related modes (@pxref{Conflicts}).
@c
@orgcmdkkcc{S-@key{up},S-@key{down},org-timestamp-up,org-timestamp-down-down}
Change the item under the cursor in a timestamp.  The cursor can be on a
year, month, day, hour or minute.  When the timestamp contains a time range
like @samp{15:30-16:30}, modifying the first time will also shift the second,
shifting the time block with constant length.  To change the length, modify
the second time.  Note that if the cursor is in a headline and not at a
timestamp, these same keys modify the priority of an item.
(@pxref{Priorities}).  The key bindings also conflict with shift-selection and
related modes (@pxref{Conflicts}).
@c
@orgcmd{C-c C-y,org-evaluate-time-range}
@cindex evaluate time range
Evaluate a time range by computing the difference between start and end.
With a prefix argument, insert result after the time range (in a table: into
the following column).

@vindex org-read-date-prefer-future
When Org mode prompts for a date/time, the default is shown in default
date/time format, and the prompt therefore seems to ask for a specific
format.  But it will in fact accept date/time information in a variety of
formats.  Generally, the information should start at the beginning of the
string.  Org mode will find whatever information is in
there and derive anything you have not specified from the @emph{default date
and time}.  The default is usually the current date and time, but when
modifying an existing timestamp, or when entering the second stamp of a
range, it is taken from the stamp in the buffer.  When filling in
information, Org mode assumes that most of the time you will want to enter a
date in the future: if you omit the month/year and the given day/month is
@i{before} today, it will assume that you mean a future date@footnote{See the
variable @code{org-read-date-prefer-future}.  You may set that variable to
the symbol @code{time} to even make a time before now shift the date to
tomorrow.}.  If the date has been automatically shifted into the future, the
time prompt will show this with @samp{(=>F).}

For example, let's assume that today is @b{June 13, 2006}.  Here is how
various inputs will be interpreted, the items filled in by Org mode are
in @b{bold}.

@example
3-2-5         @result{} 2003-02-05
2/5/3         @result{} 2003-02-05
14            @result{} @b{2006}-@b{06}-14
12            @result{} @b{2006}-@b{07}-12
2/5           @result{} @b{2007}-02-05
Fri           @result{} nearest Friday after the default date
sep 15        @result{} @b{2006}-09-15
feb 15        @result{} @b{2007}-02-15
sep 12 9      @result{} 2009-09-12
12:45         @result{} @b{2006}-@b{06}-@b{13} 12:45
22 sept 0:34  @result{} @b{2006}-09-22 00:34
w4            @result{} ISO week for of the current year @b{2006}
2012 w4 fri   @result{} Friday of ISO week 4 in 2012
2012-w04-5    @result{} Same as above
@end example

Furthermore you can specify a relative date by giving, as the @emph{first}
thing in the input: a plus/minus sign, a number and a letter ([hdwmy]) to
indicate change in hours, days, weeks, months, or years.  With a single plus
or minus, the date is always relative to today.  With a double plus or minus,
it is relative to the default date.  If instead of a single letter, you use
the abbreviation of day name, the date will be the Nth such day, e.g.:

@example
+0            @result{} today
.             @result{} today
+4d           @result{} four days from today
+4            @result{} same as above
+2w           @result{} two weeks from today
++5           @result{} five days from default date
+2tue         @result{} second Tuesday from now
-wed          @result{} last Wednesday
@end example

@vindex parse-time-months
@vindex parse-time-weekdays
The function understands English month and weekday abbreviations.  If
you want to use unabbreviated names and/or other languages, configure
the variables @code{parse-time-months} and @code{parse-time-weekdays}.

@vindex org-read-date-force-compatible-dates
Not all dates can be represented in a given Emacs implementation.  By default
Org mode forces dates into the compatibility range 1970--2037 which works on
all Emacs implementations.  If you want to use dates outside of this range,
read the docstring of the variable
@code{org-read-date-force-compatible-dates}.

You can specify a time range by giving start and end times or by giving a

@cindex calendar, for selecting date
@vindex org-popup-calendar-for-date-prompt
Parallel to the minibuffer prompt, a calendar is popped up@footnote{If
you don't need/want the calendar, configure the variable
@code{org-popup-calendar-for-date-prompt}.}.  When you exit the date
prompt, either by clicking on a date in the calendar, or by pressing
@key{RET}, the date selected in the calendar will be combined with the

@kindex mouse-1
@kindex S-@key{right}

The actions of the date/time prompt may seem complex, but I assure you they
will grow on you, and you will start getting annoyed by pretty much any other
way of entering a date/time out there.  To help you understand what is going

@vindex org-display-custom-times
@vindex org-time-stamp-custom-formats
Org mode uses the standard ISO notation for dates and times as it is
defined in ISO 8601.  If you cannot get used to this and require another
representation of date and time to keep you happy, you can get it by
customizing the options @code{org-display-custom-times} and
@code{org-time-stamp-custom-formats}.

@table @kbd
@orgcmd{C-c C-x C-t,org-toggle-time-stamp-overlays}
Toggle the display of custom formats for dates and times.
@end table

@noindent
Org mode needs the default format for scanning, so the custom date/time
format does not @emph{replace} the default format---instead it is put
@emph{over} the default format using text properties.  This has the
following consequences:
@itemize @bullet
@item
You cannot place the cursor onto a timestamp anymore, only before or
after.
@item
The @kbd{S-@key{up}/@key{down}} keys can no longer be used to adjust
each component of a timestamp.  If the cursor is at the beginning of
the stamp, @kbd{S-@key{up}/@key{down}} will change the stamp by one day,
just like @kbd{S-@key{left}/@key{right}}.  At the end of the stamp, the
time will be changed by one minute.
@item
If the timestamp contains a range of clock times or a repeater, these
will not be overlaid, but remain in the buffer as they were.
@item
When you delete a timestamp character-by-character, it will only
disappear from the buffer after @emph{all} (invisible) characters
belonging to the ISO timestamp have been removed.
@item
If the custom timestamp format is longer than the default and you are
using dates in tables, table alignment will be messed up.  If the custom
format is shorter, things do work as expected.

@node Deadlines and scheduling, Clocking work time, Creating timestamps, Dates and Times
@section Deadlines and scheduling

A timestamp may be preceded by special keywords to facilitate planning:

@table @var
@item DEADLINE
@cindex DEADLINE keyword

Meaning: the task (most likely a TODO item, though not necessarily) is supposed
to be finished on that date.

@vindex org-deadline-warning-days
@vindex org-agenda-skip-deadline-prewarning-if-scheduled
On the deadline date, the task will be listed in the agenda.  In
addition, the agenda for @emph{today} will carry a warning about the
approaching or missed deadline, starting
@code{org-deadline-warning-days} before the due date, and continuing
until the entry is marked DONE@.  An example:

@example
*** TODO write article about the Earth for the Guide
    DEADLINE: <2004-02-29 Sun>
    The editor in charge is [[bbdb:Ford Prefect]]
@end example

You can specify a different lead time for warnings for a specific
deadlines using the following syntax.  Here is an example with a warning
period of 5 days @code{DEADLINE: <2004-02-29 Sun -5d>}.  This warning is
deactivated if the task get scheduled and you set
@code{org-agenda-skip-deadline-prewarning-if-scheduled} to @code{t}.

@item SCHEDULED
@cindex SCHEDULED keyword

Meaning: you are planning to start working on that task on the given
date.

@vindex org-agenda-skip-scheduled-if-done
The headline will be listed under the given date@footnote{It will still
be listed on that date after it has been marked DONE@.  If you don't like
this, set the variable @code{org-agenda-skip-scheduled-if-done}.}.  In
addition, a reminder that the scheduled date has passed will be present
in the compilation for @emph{today}, until the entry is marked DONE, i.e.,
the task will automatically be forwarded until completed.

@example
*** TODO Call Trillian for a date on New Years Eve.
    SCHEDULED: <2004-12-25 Sat>
@end example

@vindex org-scheduled-delay-days
@vindex org-agenda-skip-scheduled-delay-if-deadline
If you want to @emph{delay} the display of this task in the agenda, use
@code{SCHEDULED: <2004-12-25 Sat -2d>}: the task is still scheduled on the
25th but will appear two days later.  In case the task contains a repeater,
the delay is considered to affect all occurrences; if you want the delay to
only affect the first scheduled occurrence of the task, use @code{--2d}
instead.  See @code{org-scheduled-delay-days} and
@code{org-agenda-skip-scheduled-delay-if-deadline} for details on how to
control this globally or per agenda.

@noindent
@b{Important:} Scheduling an item in Org mode should @i{not} be
understood in the same way that we understand @i{scheduling a meeting}.
Setting a date for a meeting is just a simple appointment, you should
mark this entry with a simple plain timestamp, to get this item shown
on the date where it applies.  This is a frequent misunderstanding by
Org users.  In Org mode, @i{scheduling} means setting a date when you
want to start working on an action item.
@end table

You may use timestamps with repeaters in scheduling and deadline
entries.  Org mode will issue early and late warnings based on the
assumption that the timestamp represents the @i{nearest instance} of
the repeater.  However, the use of diary sexp entries like
@c
@code{<%%(diary-float t 42)>}
@c
in scheduling and deadline timestamps is limited.  Org mode does not
know enough about the internals of each sexp function to issue early and
late warnings.  However, it will show the item on each day where the
sexp entry matches.

@subsection Inserting deadlines or schedules

The following commands allow you to quickly insert@footnote{The @samp{SCHEDULED} and
@samp{DEADLINE} dates are inserted on the line right below the headline.  Don't put
any text between this line and the headline.} a deadline or to schedule
an item:

@table @kbd
@c
@orgcmd{C-c C-d,org-deadline}
Insert @samp{DEADLINE} keyword along with a stamp.  The insertion will happen
in the line directly following the headline.  Any CLOSED timestamp will be
removed.  When called with a prefix arg, an existing deadline will be removed
from the entry.  Depending on the variable @code{org-log-redeadline}@footnote{with corresponding
@code{#+STARTUP} keywords @code{logredeadline}, @code{lognoteredeadline},
and @code{nologredeadline}}, a note will be taken when changing an existing
deadline.

@orgcmd{C-c C-s,org-schedule}
Insert @samp{SCHEDULED} keyword along with a stamp.  The insertion will
happen in the line directly following the headline.  Any CLOSED timestamp
will be removed.  When called with a prefix argument, remove the scheduling
date from the entry.  Depending on the variable
@code{org-log-reschedule}@footnote{with corresponding @code{#+STARTUP}
keywords @code{logreschedule}, @code{lognotereschedule}, and
@code{nologreschedule}}, a note will be taken when changing an existing
scheduling time.
@c
@orgcmd{C-c C-x C-k,org-mark-entry-for-agenda-action}
@kindex k a
@kindex k s
Mark the current entry for agenda action.  After you have marked the entry
like this, you can open the agenda or the calendar to find an appropriate
date.  With the cursor on the selected date, press @kbd{k s} or @kbd{k d} to
schedule the marked item.
@c
@orgcmd{C-c / d,org-check-deadlines}
@cindex sparse tree, for deadlines
@vindex org-deadline-warning-days
Create a sparse tree with all deadlines that are either past-due, or
which will become due within @code{org-deadline-warning-days}.
With @kbd{C-u} prefix, show all deadlines in the file.  With a numeric
prefix, check that many days.  For example, @kbd{C-1 C-c / d} shows
all deadlines due tomorrow.
@c
@orgcmd{C-c / b,org-check-before-date}
Sparse tree for deadlines and scheduled items before a given date.
@c
@orgcmd{C-c / a,org-check-after-date}
Sparse tree for deadlines and scheduled items after a given date.
@end table

Note that @code{org-schedule} and @code{org-deadline} supports
setting the date by indicating a relative time: e.g., +1d will set
the date to the next day after today, and --1w will set the date
to the previous week before any current timestamp.

@node Repeated tasks,  , Inserting deadline/schedule, Deadlines and scheduling
@subsection Repeated tasks
@cindex tasks, repeated
@cindex repeated tasks

Some tasks need to be repeated again and again.  Org mode helps to
organize such tasks using a so-called repeater in a DEADLINE, SCHEDULED,
or plain timestamp.  In the following example
@example
** TODO Pay the rent
   DEADLINE: <2005-10-01 Sat +1m>
@end example
@noindent
the @code{+1m} is a repeater; the intended interpretation is that the task
has a deadline on <2005-10-01> and repeats itself every (one) month starting
from that time.  You can use yearly, monthly, weekly, daily and hourly repeat
cookies by using the @code{y/w/m/d/h} letters.  If you need both a repeater
and a special warning period in a deadline entry, the repeater should come
first and the warning period last: @code{DEADLINE: <2005-10-01 Sat +1m -3d>}.

@vindex org-todo-repeat-to-state
Deadlines and scheduled items produce entries in the agenda when they are
over-due, so it is important to be able to mark such an entry as completed
once you have done so.  When you mark a DEADLINE or a SCHEDULE with the TODO
keyword DONE, it will no longer produce entries in the agenda.  The problem
with this is, however, that then also the @emph{next} instance of the
repeated entry will not be active.  Org mode deals with this in the following
way: When you try to mark such an entry DONE (using @kbd{C-c C-t}), it will
shift the base date of the repeating timestamp by the repeater interval, and
immediately set the entry state back to TODO@footnote{In fact, the target
state is taken from, in this sequence, the @code{REPEAT_TO_STATE} property or
the variable @code{org-todo-repeat-to-state}.  If neither of these is
specified, the target state defaults to the first state of the TODO state
sequence.}.  In the example above, setting the state to DONE would actually
switch the date like this:

@example
** TODO Pay the rent
   DEADLINE: <2005-11-01 Tue +1m>
@end example

@vindex org-log-repeat
A timestamp@footnote{You can change this using the option
@code{org-log-repeat}, or the @code{#+STARTUP} options @code{logrepeat},
@code{lognoterepeat}, and @code{nologrepeat}.  With @code{lognoterepeat}, you
will also be prompted for a note.} will be added under the deadline, to keep
a record that you actually acted on the previous instance of this deadline.

As a consequence of shifting the base date, this entry will no longer be
visible in the agenda when checking past dates, but all future instances
will be visible.

With the @samp{+1m} cookie, the date shift will always be exactly one
month.  So if you have not paid the rent for three months, marking this
entry DONE will still keep it as an overdue deadline.  Depending on the
task, this may not be the best way to handle it.  For example, if you
forgot to call your father for 3 weeks, it does not make sense to call
him 3 times in a single day to make up for it.  Finally, there are tasks
like changing batteries which should always repeat a certain time
@i{after} the last time you did it.  For these tasks, Org mode has
special repeaters  @samp{++} and @samp{.+}.  For example:

@example
** TODO Call Father
   DEADLINE: <2008-02-10 Sun ++1w>
   Marking this DONE will shift the date by at least one week,
   but also by as many weeks as it takes to get this date into
   the future.  However, it stays on a Sunday, even if you called
   and marked it done on Saturday.
** TODO Check the batteries in the smoke detectors
   DEADLINE: <2005-11-01 Tue .+1m>
   Marking this DONE will shift the date to one month after
   today.
@end example

@vindex org-agenda-skip-scheduled-if-deadline-is-shown
You may have both scheduling and deadline information for a specific task.
If the repeater is set for the scheduling information only, you probably want
the repeater to be ignored after the deadline.  If so, set the variable
@code{org-agenda-skip-scheduled-if-deadline-is-shown} to
@code{repeated-after-deadline}.  If you want both scheduling and deadline
information to repeat after the same interval, set the same repeater for both
timestamps.

An alternative to using a repeater is to create a number of copies of a task
subtree, with dates shifted in each copy.  The command @kbd{C-c C-x c} was
created for this purpose, it is described in @ref{Structure editing}.


@node Clocking work time, Effort estimates, Deadlines and scheduling, Dates and Times
@section Clocking work time
@cindex clocking time
@cindex time clocking

Org mode allows you to clock the time you spend on specific tasks in a
project.  When you start working on an item, you can start the clock.  When
you stop working on that task, or when you mark the task done, the clock is
stopped and the corresponding time interval is recorded.  It also computes
the total time spent on each subtree@footnote{Clocking only works if all
headings are indented with less than 30 stars.  This is a hardcoded
limitation of @code{lmax} in @code{org-clock-sum}.} of a project.  And it
remembers a
history or tasks recently clocked, to that you can jump quickly between a
number of tasks absorbing your time.

To save the clock history across Emacs sessions, use
@lisp
(setq org-clock-persist 'history)
(org-clock-persistence-insinuate)
@end lisp
When you clock into a new task after resuming Emacs, the incomplete
clock@footnote{To resume the clock under the assumption that you have worked
on this task while outside Emacs, use @code{(setq org-clock-persist t)}.}
will be found (@pxref{Resolving idle time}) and you will be prompted about
what to do with it.

@vindex org-clock-into-drawer
@vindex org-clock-continuously
@cindex property, LOG_INTO_DRAWER
Start the clock on the current item (clock-in).  This inserts the CLOCK
keyword together with a timestamp.  If this is not the first clocking of
this item, the multiple CLOCK lines will be wrapped into a
@code{:LOGBOOK:} drawer (see also the variable
@code{org-clock-into-drawer}).  You can also overrule
the setting of this variable for a subtree by setting a
@code{CLOCK_INTO_DRAWER} or @code{LOG_INTO_DRAWER} property.
When called with a @kbd{C-u} prefix argument,
select the task from a list of recently clocked tasks.  With two @kbd{C-u
C-u} prefixes, clock into the task at point and mark it as the default task;
the default task will then always be available with letter @kbd{d} when
selecting a clocking task.  With three @kbd{C-u C-u C-u} prefixes, force
continuous clocking by starting the clock when the last clock stopped.@*
@cindex property: CLOCK_MODELINE_TOTAL
@cindex property: LAST_REPEAT
@vindex org-clock-modeline-total
While the clock is running, the current clocking time is shown in the mode
line, along with the title of the task.  The clock time shown will be all
time ever clocked for this task and its children.  If the task has an effort
estimate (@pxref{Effort estimates}), the mode line displays the current
clocking time against it@footnote{To add an effort estimate ``on the fly'',
hook a function doing this to @code{org-clock-in-prepare-hook}.}  If the task
is a repeating one (@pxref{Repeated tasks}), only the time since the last
reset of the task @footnote{as recorded by the @code{LAST_REPEAT} property}
will be shown.  More control over what time is shown can be exercised with
the @code{CLOCK_MODELINE_TOTAL} property.  It may have the values
@code{current} to show only the current clocking instance, @code{today} to
show all time clocked on this tasks today (see also the variable
@code{org-extend-today-until}), @code{all} to include all time, or
@code{auto} which is the default@footnote{See also the variable

Stop the clock (clock-out).  This inserts another timestamp at the same
location where the clock was last started.  It also directly computes
the resulting time in inserts it after the time range as @samp{=>
HH:MM}.  See the variable @code{org-log-note-clock-out} for the
possibility to record an additional note together with the clock-out
timestamp@footnote{The corresponding in-buffer setting is:

@orgcmd{S-M-@key{up/down},org-timestamp-up/down}
On @code{CLOCK} log lines, increase/decrease the timestamp at point and
the one of the previous (or the next clock) timestamp by the same duration.
For example, if you hit @kbd{S-M-@key{up}} to increase a clocked-out timestamp
by five minutes, then the clocked-in timestamp of the next clock will be
increased by five minutes.
@orgcmd{C-c C-t,org-todo}
Changing the TODO state of an item to DONE automatically stops the clock

formatted as one or several Org tables.

@table @kbd
@orgcmd{C-c C-x C-r,org-clock-report}

@node Resolving idle time,  , The clock table, Clocking work time
@subsection Resolving idle time and continuous clocking

@subsubheading Resolving idle time
@cindex resolve idle time
@vindex org-clock-x11idle-program-name

@cindex idle, resolve, dangling
If you clock in on a work item, and then walk away from your
computer---perhaps to take a phone call---you often need to ``resolve'' the
time you were away by either subtracting it from the current clock, or
applying it to another one.

@vindex org-clock-idle-time
By customizing the variable @code{org-clock-idle-time} to some integer, such
as 10 or 15, Emacs can alert you when you get back to your computer after
being idle for that many minutes@footnote{On computers using Mac OS X,
idleness is based on actual user idleness, not just Emacs' idle time.  For
X11, you can install a utility program @file{x11idle.c}, available in the
@code{contrib/scripts} directory of the Org git distribution, or install the
@file{xprintidle} package and set it to the variable
@code{org-clock-x11idle-program-name} if you are running Debian, to get the
same general treatment of idleness.  On other systems, idle time refers to
Emacs idle time only.}, and ask what you want to do with the idle time.
There will be a question waiting for you when you get back, indicating how
much idle time has passed (constantly updated with the current amount), as
well as a set of choices to correct the discrepancy:

@table @kbd
@item k
To keep some or all of the minutes and stay clocked in, press @kbd{k}.  Org
will ask how many of the minutes to keep.  Press @key{RET} to keep them all,
effectively changing nothing, or enter a number to keep that many minutes.
@item K
If you use the shift key and press @kbd{K}, it will keep however many minutes
you request and then immediately clock out of that task.  If you keep all of
the minutes, this is the same as just clocking out of the current task.
@item s
To keep none of the minutes, use @kbd{s} to subtract all the away time from
the clock, and then check back in from the moment you returned.
@item S
To keep none of the minutes and just clock out at the start of the away time,
use the shift key and press @kbd{S}.  Remember that using shift will always
leave you clocked out, no matter which option you choose.
@item C
To cancel the clock altogether, use @kbd{C}.  Note that if instead of
canceling you subtract the away time, and the resulting clock amount is less
than a minute, the clock will still be canceled rather than clutter up the
log with an empty entry.
@end table

What if you subtracted those away minutes from the current clock, and now
want to apply them to a new clock?  Simply clock in to any task immediately
after the subtraction.  Org will notice that you have subtracted time ``on
the books'', so to speak, and will ask if you want to apply those minutes to
the next task you clock in on.

There is one other instance when this clock resolution magic occurs.  Say you
were clocked in and hacking away, and suddenly your cat chased a mouse who
scared a hamster that crashed into your UPS's power button!  You suddenly
lose all your buffers, but thanks to auto-save you still have your recent Org
mode changes, including your last clock in.

If you restart Emacs and clock into any task, Org will notice that you have a
dangling clock which was never clocked out from your last session.  Using
that clock's starting time as the beginning of the unaccounted-for period,
Org will ask how you want to resolve that time.  The logic and behavior is
identical to dealing with away time due to idleness; it is just happening due
to a recovery event rather than a set amount of idle time.

You can also check all the files visited by your Org agenda for dangling
clocks at any time using @kbd{M-x org-resolve-clocks RET} (or @kbd{C-c C-x C-z}).

@subsubheading Continuous clocking
@cindex continuous clocking
@vindex org-clock-continuously

You may want to start clocking from the time when you clocked out the
previous task.  To enable this systematically, set @code{org-clock-continuously}
to @code{t}.  Each time you clock in, Org retrieves the clock-out time of the
last clocked entry for this session, and start the new clock from there.

If you only want this from time to time, use three universal prefix arguments
with @code{org-clock-in} and two @kbd{C-u C-u} with @code{org-clock-in-last}.

@node Effort estimates, Relative timer, Clocking work time, Dates and Times
@section Effort estimates
@cindex effort estimates

@cindex property, Effort
@vindex org-effort-property
If you want to plan your work in a very detailed way, or if you need to
produce offers with quotations of the estimated work effort, you may want to
assign effort estimates to entries.  If you are also clocking your work, you
may later want to compare the planned effort with the actual working time, a
great way to improve planning estimates.  Effort estimates are stored in a
special property @samp{Effort}@footnote{You may change the property being
used with the variable @code{org-effort-property}.}.  You can set the effort
for an entry with the following commands:

@table @kbd
@orgcmd{C-c C-x e,org-set-effort}
Set the effort estimate for the current entry.  With a numeric prefix
argument, set it to the Nth allowed value (see below).  This command is also
accessible from the agenda with the @kbd{e} key.
@orgcmd{C-c C-x C-e,org-clock-modify-effort-estimate}
Modify the effort estimate of the item currently being clocked.
@end table

Clearly the best way to work with effort estimates is through column view
(@pxref{Column view}).  You should start by setting up discrete values for
effort estimates, and a @code{COLUMNS} format that displays these values
together with clock sums (if you want to clock your time).  For a specific
buffer you can use

@example
#+PROPERTY: Effort_ALL 0 0:10 0:30 1:00 2:00 3:00 4:00 5:00 6:00 7:00
#+COLUMNS: %40ITEM(Task) %17Effort(Estimated Effort)@{:@} %CLOCKSUM
@end example

@noindent
@vindex org-global-properties
@vindex org-columns-default-format
or, even better, you can set up these values globally by customizing the
variables @code{org-global-properties} and @code{org-columns-default-format}.
In particular if you want to use this setup also in the agenda, a global
setup may be advised.

The way to assign estimates to individual items is then to switch to column
mode, and to use @kbd{S-@key{right}} and @kbd{S-@key{left}} to change the
value.  The values you enter will immediately be summed up in the hierarchy.
In the column next to it, any clocked time will be displayed.

@vindex org-agenda-columns-add-appointments-to-effort-sum
If you switch to column view in the daily/weekly agenda, the effort column
will summarize the estimated work effort for each day@footnote{Please note
the pitfalls of summing hierarchical data in a flat list (@pxref{Agenda
column view}).}, and you can use this to find space in your schedule.  To get
an overview of the entire part of the day that is committed, you can set the
option @code{org-agenda-columns-add-appointments-to-effort-sum}.  The
appointments on a day that take place over a specified time interval will
then also be added to the load estimate of the day.

Effort estimates can be used in secondary agenda filtering that is triggered
with the @kbd{/} key in the agenda (@pxref{Agenda commands}).  If you have
these estimates defined consistently, two or three key presses will narrow
down the list to stuff that fits into an available time slot.

@node Relative timer, Countdown timer, Effort estimates, Dates and Times
@section Taking notes with a relative timer
@cindex relative timer

When taking notes during, for example, a meeting or a video viewing, it can
be useful to have access to times relative to a starting time.  Org provides
such a relative timer and make it easy to create timed notes.

@table @kbd
@orgcmd{C-c C-x .,org-timer}
Insert a relative time into the buffer.  The first time you use this, the
timer will be started.  When called with a prefix argument, the timer is
restarted.
@orgcmd{C-c C-x -,org-timer-item}
Insert a description list item with the current relative time.  With a prefix
argument, first reset the timer to 0.
@orgcmd{M-@key{RET},org-insert-heading}
Once the timer list is started, you can also use @kbd{M-@key{RET}} to insert
new timer items.
@c for key sequences with a comma, command name macros fail :(
@kindex C-c C-x ,
@item C-c C-x ,
Pause the timer, or continue it if it is already paused
(@command{org-timer-pause-or-continue}).
@c removed the sentence because it is redundant to the following item
@kindex C-u C-c C-x ,
@item C-u C-c C-x ,
Stop the timer.  After this, you can only start a new timer, not continue the
old one.  This command also removes the timer from the mode line.
@orgcmd{C-c C-x 0,org-timer-start}
Reset the timer without inserting anything into the buffer.  By default, the
timer is reset to 0.  When called with a @kbd{C-u} prefix, reset the timer to
specific starting offset.  The user is prompted for the offset, with a
default taken from a timer string at point, if any, So this can be used to
restart taking notes after a break in the process.  When called with a double
prefix argument @kbd{C-u C-u}, change all timer strings in the active region
by a certain amount.  This can be used to fix timer strings if the timer was
not started at exactly the right moment.
@end table

@node Countdown timer,  , Relative timer, Dates and Times
@section Countdown timer
@cindex Countdown timer

Calling @code{org-timer-set-timer} from an Org mode buffer runs a countdown

@code{org-timer-set-timer} prompts the user for a duration and displays a
countdown timer in the modeline.  @code{org-timer-default-timer} sets the
default countdown value.  Giving a prefix numeric argument overrides this
default value.

An important part of any organization system is the ability to quickly
capture new ideas and tasks, and to associate reference material with them.
Org does this using a process called @i{capture}.  It also can store files
related to a task (@i{attachments}) in a special directory.  Once in the
system, tasks and projects need to be moved around.  Moving completed project
trees to an archive file keeps the system compact and fast.

@cindex capture

Capture lets you quickly store notes with little interruption of your work
flow.  Org's method for capturing new items is heavily inspired by John
Wiegley excellent @file{remember.el} package.  Up to version 6.36, Org
used a special setup for @file{remember.el}, then replaced it with
@file{org-remember.el}.  As of version 8.0, @file{org-remember.el} has
been completely replaced by @file{org-capture.el}.

If your configuration depends on @file{org-remember.el}, you need to update
it and use the setup described below.  To convert your
@code{org-remember-templates}, run the command
@example
@kbd{M-x org-capture-import-remember-templates RET}
@end example
@noindent and then customize the new variable with @kbd{M-x
customize-variable org-capture-templates}, check the result, and save the
customization.

@table @kbd
@orgcmd{C-c c,org-capture}
Call the command @code{org-capture}.  Note that this keybinding is global and
not active by default: you need to install it.  If you have templates
@cindex date tree
defined @pxref{Capture templates}, it will offer these templates for
selection or use a new Org outline node as the default template.  It will
insert the template into the target file and switch to an indirect buffer
narrowed to this new node.  You may then insert the information you want.

@orgcmd{C-c C-c,org-capture-finalize}
Once you have finished entering information into the capture buffer, @kbd{C-c
C-c} will return you to the window configuration before the capture process,
so that you can resume your work without further distraction.  When called
with a prefix arg, finalize and then jump to the captured item.

@orgcmd{C-c C-w,org-capture-refile}
Finalize the capture process by refiling (@pxref{Refile and copy}) the note to
a different place.  Please realize that this is a normal refiling command
that will be executed---so the cursor position at the moment you run this
command is important.  If you have inserted a tree with a parent and
children, first move the cursor back to the parent.  Any prefix argument
given to this command will be passed on to the @code{org-refile} command.

@orgcmd{C-c C-k,org-capture-kill}
Abort the capture process and return to the previous state.

@end table

You can also call @code{org-capture} in a special way from the agenda, using
the @kbd{k c} key combination.  With this access, any timestamps inserted by
the selected capture template will default to the cursor date in the agenda,
rather than to the current date.

To find the locations of the last stored capture, use @code{org-capture} with
prefix commands:

@table @kbd
@orgkey{C-u C-c c}
Visit the target location of a capture template.  You get to select the
template in the usual way.
@orgkey{C-u C-u C-c c}
Visit the last stored capture item in its buffer.
@end table

@vindex org-capture-bookmark
@cindex org-capture-last-stored
You can also jump to the bookmark @code{org-capture-last-stored}, which will
automatically be created unless you set @code{org-capture-bookmark} to
@code{nil}.

To insert the capture at point in an Org buffer, call @code{org-capture} with
a @code{C-0} prefix argument.

@node Capture templates,  , Using capture, Capture
@subsection Capture templates
@cindex templates, for Capture

You can use templates for different types of capture items, and
for different target locations.  The easiest way to create such templates is
through the customize interface.

@table @kbd
@orgkey{C-c c C}
Customize the variable @code{org-capture-templates}.
@end table

Before we give the formal description of template definitions, let's look at
an example.  Say you would like to use one template to create general TODO
entries, and you want to put these entries under the heading @samp{Tasks} in
your file @file{~/org/gtd.org}.  Also, a date tree in the file
@file{journal.org} should capture journal entries.  A possible configuration
would look like:

@smalllisp
@group
(setq org-capture-templates
 '(("t" "Todo" entry (file+headline "~/org/gtd.org" "Tasks")
        "* TODO %?\n  %i\n  %a")
   ("j" "Journal" entry (file+datetree "~/org/journal.org")
        "* %?\nEntered on %U\n  %i\n  %a")))
@end group
@end smalllisp

@noindent If you then press @kbd{C-c c t}, Org will prepare the template
for you like this:
@example
* TODO
  [[file:@var{link to where you initiated capture}]]
@end example

@noindent
During expansion of the template, @code{%a} has been replaced by a link to
the location from where you called the capture command.  This can be
extremely useful for deriving tasks from emails, for example.  You fill in
the task definition, press @kbd{C-c C-c} and Org returns you to the same
place where you started the capture process.

To define special keys to capture to a particular template without going
through the interactive template selection, you can create your key binding
like this:

@lisp
(define-key global-map "\C-cx"
   (lambda () (interactive) (org-capture nil "x")))
@end lisp

@menu
* Template elements::           What is needed for a complete template entry

* Templates in contexts::       Only show a template in a specific context
@end menu

@node Template elements, Template expansion, Capture templates, Capture templates
@subsubsection Template elements

Now lets look at the elements of a template definition.  Each entry in
@code{org-capture-templates} is a list with the following items:

@table @var
@item keys
The keys that will select the template, as a string, characters
only, for example @code{"a"} for a template to be selected with a
single key, or @code{"bt"} for selection with two keys.  When using
several keys, keys using the same prefix key must be sequential
in the list and preceded by a 2-element entry explaining the
prefix key, for example
@smalllisp
         ("b" "Templates for marking stuff to buy")
@end smalllisp
@noindent If you do not define a template for the @kbd{C} key, this key will
be used to open the customize buffer for this complex variable.

@item description
A short string describing the template, which will be shown during
selection.

@item type
The type of entry, a symbol.  Valid values are:

@table @code
@item entry
An Org mode node, with a headline.  Will be filed as the child of the target
entry or as a top-level entry.  The target file should be an Org mode file.
@item item
A plain list item, placed in the first plain  list at the target
location.  Again the target file should be an Org file.
@item checkitem
A checkbox item.  This only differs from the plain list item by the
default template.
@item table-line
a new line in the first table at the target location.  Where exactly the
line will be inserted depends on the properties @code{:prepend} and
@code{:table-line-pos} (see below).
@item plain
Text to be inserted as it is.
@end table

@item target
@vindex org-default-notes-file
Specification of where the captured item should be placed.  In Org mode
files, targets usually define a node.  Entries will become children of this
node.  Other types will be added to the table or list in the body of this
node.  Most target specifications contain a file name.  If that file name is
the empty string, it defaults to @code{org-default-notes-file}.  A file can
also be given as a variable, function, or Emacs Lisp form.

Valid values are:

@table @code
@item (file "path/to/file")
Text will be placed at the beginning or end of that file.

@item (id "id of existing org entry")
Filing as child of this entry, or in the body of the entry.

@item (file+headline "path/to/file" "node headline")
Fast configuration if the target heading is unique in the file.

@item (file+olp "path/to/file" "Level 1 heading" "Level 2" ...)
For non-unique headings, the full path is safer.

@item (file+regexp  "path/to/file" "regexp to find location")
Use a regular expression to position the cursor.

@item (file+datetree "path/to/file")
Will create a heading in a date tree for today's date@footnote{Datetree
headlines for years accept tags, so if you use both @code{* 2013 :noexport:}
and @code{* 2013} in your file, the capture will refile the note to the first
one matched.}.

@item (file+datetree+prompt "path/to/file")
Will create a heading in a date tree, but will prompt for the date.

@item (file+function "path/to/file" function-finding-location)
A function to find the right location in the file.

@item (clock)
File to the entry that is currently being clocked.

@item (function function-finding-location)
Most general way, write your own function to find both
file and location.
@end table

@item template
The template for creating the capture item.  If you leave this empty, an
appropriate default template will be used.  Otherwise this is a string with
escape codes, which will be replaced depending on time and context of the
capture call.  The string with escapes may be loaded from a template file,
using the special syntax @code{(file "path/to/template")}.  See below for
more details.

@item properties
The rest of the entry is a property list of additional options.
Recognized properties are:

@table @code
@item :prepend
Normally new captured information will be appended at
the target location (last child, last table line, last list item...).
Setting this property will change that.

@item :immediate-finish
When set, do not offer to edit the information, just
file it away immediately.  This makes sense if the template only needs
information that can be added automatically.

@item :empty-lines
Set this to the number of lines to insert
before and after the new item.  Default 0, only common other value is 1.

@item :clock-in
Start the clock in this item.

@item :clock-keep
Keep the clock running when filing the captured entry.

@item :clock-resume
If starting the capture interrupted a clock, restart that clock when finished
with the capture.  Note that @code{:clock-keep} has precedence over
@code{:clock-resume}.  When setting both to @code{t}, the current clock will
run and the previous one will not be resumed.

@item :unnarrowed
Do not narrow the target buffer, simply show the full buffer.  Default is to
narrow it so that you only see the new material.

@item :table-line-pos
Specification of the location in the table where the new line should be
inserted.  It should be a string like @code{"II-3"} meaning that the new
line should become the third line before the second horizontal separator
line.

@item :kill-buffer
If the target file was not yet visited when capture was invoked, kill the
buffer again after capture is completed.

@subsubsection Templates in contexts

@vindex org-capture-templates-contexts
To control whether a capture template should be accessible from a specific
context, you can customize @code{org-capture-templates-contexts}.  Let's say
for example that you have a capture template @code{"p"} for storing Gnus
emails containing patches.  Then you would configure this option like this:

@smalllisp
(setq org-capture-templates-contexts
      '(("p" (in-mode . "message-mode"))))
@end smalllisp

You can also tell that the command key @code{"p"} should refer to another
template.  In that case, add this command key like this:

@smalllisp
(setq org-capture-templates-contexts
      '(("p" "q" (in-mode . "message-mode"))))
@end smalllisp

@section Attachments
@cindex attachments

@vindex org-attach-directory
It is often useful to associate reference material with an outline node/task.
Small chunks of plain text can simply be stored in the subtree of a project.
Hyperlinks (@pxref{Hyperlinks}) can establish associations with
files that live elsewhere on your computer or in the cloud, like emails or
source code files belonging to a project.  Another method is @i{attachments},
which are files located in a directory belonging to an outline node.  Org
uses directories named by the unique ID of each entry.  These directories are
located in the @file{data} directory which lives in the same directory where
your Org file lives@footnote{If you move entries or Org files from one
directory to another, you may want to configure @code{org-attach-directory}
to contain an absolute path.}.  If you initialize this directory with
@code{git init}, Org will automatically commit changes when it sees them.
The attachment system has been contributed to Org by John Wiegley.

In cases where it seems better to do so, you can also attach a directory of your
choice to an entry.  You can also make children inherit the attachment
directory from a parent, so that an entire subtree uses the same attached
directory.

@noindent The following commands deal with attachments:

@table @kbd
@orgcmd{C-c C-a,org-attach}
The dispatcher for commands related to the attachment system.  After these
keys, a list of commands is displayed and you must press an additional key
to select a command:

@table @kbd
@orgcmdtkc{a,C-c C-a a,org-attach-attach}
@vindex org-attach-method
Select a file and move it into the task's attachment directory.  The file
will be copied, moved, or linked, depending on @code{org-attach-method}.
Note that hard links are not supported on all systems.

@kindex C-c C-a c
@kindex C-c C-a m
@kindex C-c C-a l
@item c/m/l
Attach a file using the copy/move/link method.
Note that hard links are not supported on all systems.

@orgcmdtkc{n,C-c C-a n,org-attach-new}
Create a new attachment as an Emacs buffer.

@orgcmdtkc{z,C-c C-a z,org-attach-sync}
Synchronize the current task with its attachment directory, in case you added
attachments yourself.

@orgcmdtkc{o,C-c C-a o,org-attach-open}
@vindex org-file-apps
Open current task's attachment.  If there is more than one, prompt for a
file name first.  Opening will follow the rules set by @code{org-file-apps}.
For more details, see the information on following hyperlinks
(@pxref{Handling links}).

@orgcmdtkc{O,C-c C-a O,org-attach-open-in-emacs}
Also open the attachment, but force opening the file in Emacs.

@orgcmdtkc{f,C-c C-a f,org-attach-reveal}
Open the current task's attachment directory.

@orgcmdtkc{F,C-c C-a F,org-attach-reveal-in-emacs}
Also open the directory, but force using @command{dired} in Emacs.

@orgcmdtkc{d,C-c C-a d,org-attach-delete-one}
Select and delete a single attachment.

@orgcmdtkc{D,C-c C-a D,org-attach-delete-all}
Delete all of a task's attachments.  A safer way is to open the directory in
@command{dired} and delete from there.

@orgcmdtkc{s,C-c C-a s,org-attach-set-directory}
@cindex property, ATTACH_DIR
Set a specific directory as the entry's attachment directory.  This works by
putting the directory path into the @code{ATTACH_DIR} property.

@orgcmdtkc{i,C-c C-a i,org-attach-set-inherit}
@cindex property, ATTACH_DIR_INHERIT
Set the @code{ATTACH_DIR_INHERIT} property, so that children will use the
same directory for attachments as the parent does.
@end table
@end table

@node RSS Feeds, Protocols, Attachments, Capture - Refile - Archive
@section RSS feeds
@cindex RSS feeds
@cindex Atom feeds

Org can add and change entries based on information found in RSS feeds and
Atom feeds.  You could use this to make a task out of each new podcast in a
podcast feed.  Or you could use a phone-based note-creating service on the
web to import tasks into Org.  To access feeds, configure the variable
@code{org-feed-alist}.  The docstring of this variable has detailed
information.  Here is just an example:

@smalllisp
@group
(setq org-feed-alist
     '(("Slashdot"
         "http://rss.slashdot.org/Slashdot/slashdot"
         "~/txt/org/feeds.org" "Slashdot Entries")))
@end group
@end smalllisp

@noindent
will configure that new items from the feed provided by
@code{rss.slashdot.org} will result in new entries in the file
@file{~/org/feeds.org} under the heading @samp{Slashdot Entries}, whenever
the following command is used:

@table @kbd
@orgcmd{C-c C-x g,org-feed-update-all}
@item C-c C-x g
Collect items from the feeds configured in @code{org-feed-alist} and act upon
them.
@orgcmd{C-c C-x G,org-feed-goto-inbox}
Prompt for a feed name and go to the inbox configured for this feed.
@end table

Under the same headline, Org will create a drawer @samp{FEEDSTATUS} in which
it will store information about the status of items in the feed, to avoid
adding the same item several times.  You should add @samp{FEEDSTATUS} to the
list of drawers in that file:

@example
#+DRAWERS: LOGBOOK PROPERTIES FEEDSTATUS
@end example

For more information, including how to read atom feeds, see
@file{org-feed.el} and the docstring of @code{org-feed-alist}.

@node Protocols, Refile and copy, RSS Feeds, Capture - Refile - Archive
@section Protocols for external access
@cindex protocols, for external access
@cindex emacsserver

You can set up Org for handling protocol calls from outside applications that
are passed to Emacs through the @file{emacsserver}.  For example, you can
configure bookmarks in your web browser to send a link to the current page to
Org and create a note from it using capture (@pxref{Capture}).  Or you
could create a bookmark that will tell Emacs to open the local source file of
a remote website you are looking at with the browser.  See
@uref{http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/org-protocol.php} for detailed
documentation and setup instructions.

@node Refile and copy, Archiving, Protocols, Capture - Refile - Archive
@section Refile and copy
@cindex refiling notes
@cindex copying notes

When reviewing the captured data, you may want to refile or to copy some of
the entries into a different list, for example into a project.  Cutting,
finding the right location, and then pasting the note is cumbersome.  To
simplify this process, you can use the following special command:

@table @kbd
@orgcmd{C-c M-w,org-copy}
@findex org-copy
Copying works like refiling, except that the original note is not deleted.
@orgcmd{C-c C-w,org-refile}
@findex org-refile
@vindex org-reverse-note-order
@vindex org-refile-targets
@vindex org-refile-use-outline-path
@vindex org-outline-path-complete-in-steps
@vindex org-refile-allow-creating-parent-nodes
@vindex org-log-refile
@vindex org-refile-use-cache
@vindex org-refile-keep
Refile the entry or region at point.  This command offers possible locations
for refiling the entry and lets you select one with completion.  The item (or
all items in the region) is filed below the target heading as a subitem.
Depending on @code{org-reverse-note-order}, it will be either the first or
last subitem.@*
By default, all level 1 headlines in the current buffer are considered to be
targets, but you can have more complex definitions across a number of files.
See the variable @code{org-refile-targets} for details.  If you would like to
select a location via a file-path-like completion along the outline path, see
the variables @code{org-refile-use-outline-path} and
@code{org-outline-path-complete-in-steps}.  If you would like to be able to
create new nodes as new parents for refiling on the fly, check the
variable @code{org-refile-allow-creating-parent-nodes}.
When the variable @code{org-log-refile}@footnote{with corresponding
@code{#+STARTUP} keywords @code{logrefile}, @code{lognoterefile},
and @code{nologrefile}} is set, a timestamp or a note will be
recorded when an entry has been refiled.
@orgkey{C-u C-c C-w}
Use the refile interface to jump to a heading.
@orgcmd{C-u C-u C-c C-w,org-refile-goto-last-stored}
Jump to the location where @code{org-refile} last moved a tree to.
@item C-2 C-c C-w
Refile as the child of the item currently being clocked.
@item C-3 C-c C-w
Refile and keep the entry in place.  Also see @code{org-refile-keep} to make
this the default behavior, and beware that this may result in duplicated
@code{ID} properties.
@orgcmdtkc{C-0 C-c C-w @ @r{or} @ C-u C-u C-u C-c C-w,C-0 C-c C-w,org-refile-cache-clear}
Clear the target cache.  Caching of refile targets can be turned on by
setting @code{org-refile-use-cache}.  To make the command see new possible
targets, you have to clear the cache with this command.

When a project represented by a (sub)tree is finished, you may want
to move the tree out of the way and to stop it from contributing to the

searches like the construction of agenda views fast.

@table @kbd

@subsection Moving a tree to the archive file
@cindex external archiving

The most common archiving action is to move a project tree to another file,
the archive file.

@table @kbd
@orgcmdkskc{C-c C-x C-s,C-c $,org-archive-subtree}
@vindex org-archive-location
Archive the subtree starting at the cursor position to the location
given by @code{org-archive-location}.
@orgkey{C-u C-c C-x C-s}
Check if any direct children of the current headline could be moved to
the archive.  To do this, each subtree is checked for open TODO entries.
If none are found, the command offers to move it to the archive
location.  If the cursor is @emph{not} on a headline when this command
is invoked, the level 1 trees will be checked.
@end table

@cindex archive locations
The default archive location is a file in the same directory as the
current file, with the name derived by appending @file{_archive} to the
current file name.  You can also choose what heading to file archived
items under, with the possibility to add them to a datetree in a file.
For information and examples on how to specify the file and the heading,
see the documentation string of the variable
@code{org-archive-location}.

There is also an in-buffer option for setting this variable, for
example@footnote{For backward compatibility, the following also works:
If there are several such lines in a file, each specifies the archive
location for the text below it.  The first such line also applies to any
text before its definition.  However, using this method is
@emph{strongly} deprecated as it is incompatible with the outline
structure of the document.  The correct method for setting multiple
archive locations in a buffer is using properties.}:

@cindex #+ARCHIVE
@example
#+ARCHIVE: %s_done::
@end example

@cindex property, ARCHIVE
@noindent
If you would like to have a special ARCHIVE location for a single entry
or a (sub)tree, give the entry an @code{:ARCHIVE:} property with the
location as the value (@pxref{Properties and Columns}).

@vindex org-archive-save-context-info
When a subtree is moved, it receives a number of special properties that
record context information like the file from where the entry came, its
outline path the archiving time etc.  Configure the variable
@code{org-archive-save-context-info} to adjust the amount of information
added.


@node Internal archiving,  , Moving subtrees, Archiving
@subsection Internal archiving

If you want to just switch off (for agenda views) certain subtrees without
moving them to a different file, you can use the @code{ARCHIVE tag}.

A headline that is marked with the ARCHIVE tag (@pxref{Tags}) stays at
its location in the outline tree, but behaves in the following way:
@itemize @minus
@item
@vindex org-cycle-open-archived-trees
It does not open when you attempt to do so with a visibility cycling
command (@pxref{Visibility cycling}).  You can force cycling archived
subtrees with @kbd{C-@key{TAB}}, or by setting the option
@code{org-cycle-open-archived-trees}.  Also normal outline commands like
@code{show-all} will open archived subtrees.
@item
@vindex org-sparse-tree-open-archived-trees
During sparse tree construction (@pxref{Sparse trees}), matches in
archived subtrees are not exposed, unless you configure the option
@code{org-sparse-tree-open-archived-trees}.
@item
@vindex org-agenda-skip-archived-trees
During agenda view construction (@pxref{Agenda Views}), the content of
archived trees is ignored unless you configure the option
@code{org-agenda-skip-archived-trees}, in which case these trees will always
be included.  In the agenda you can press @kbd{v a} to get archives
temporarily included.
@item
@vindex org-export-with-archived-trees
Archived trees are not exported (@pxref{Exporting}), only the headline
is.  Configure the details using the variable
@code{org-export-with-archived-trees}.
@item
@vindex org-columns-skip-archived-trees
Archived trees are excluded from column view unless the variable
@code{org-columns-skip-archived-trees} is configured to @code{nil}.
@end itemize

The following commands help manage the ARCHIVE tag:

@table @kbd
@orgcmd{C-c C-x a,org-toggle-archive-tag}
Toggle the ARCHIVE tag for the current headline.  When the tag is set,
the headline changes to a shadowed face, and the subtree below it is
hidden.
@orgkey{C-u C-c C-x a}
Check if any direct children of the current headline should be archived.
To do this, each subtree is checked for open TODO entries.  If none are
found, the command offers to set the ARCHIVE tag for the child.  If the
cursor is @emph{not} on a headline when this command is invoked, the
level 1 trees will be checked.
@orgcmd{C-@kbd{TAB},org-force-cycle-archived}
Cycle a tree even if it is tagged with ARCHIVE.
@orgcmd{C-c C-x A,org-archive-to-archive-sibling}
Move the current entry to the @emph{Archive Sibling}.  This is a sibling of
the entry with the heading @samp{Archive} and the tag @samp{ARCHIVE}.  The
entry becomes a child of that sibling and in this way retains a lot of its
original context, including inherited tags and approximate position in the
outline.

@chapter Agenda views
@cindex agenda views

Due to the way Org works, TODO items, time-stamped items, and
tagged headlines can be scattered throughout a file or even a number of
files.  To get an overview of open action items, or of events that are
important for a particular date, this information must be collected,
sorted and displayed in an organized way.

Org can select items based on various criteria and display them
in a separate buffer.  Seven different view types are provided:

@itemize @bullet
@item
an @emph{agenda} that is like a calendar and shows information
for specific dates,
@item
a @emph{TODO list} that covers all unfinished
action items,
@item
a @emph{match view}, showings headlines based on the tags, properties, and
TODO state associated with them,
@item
a @emph{timeline view} that shows all events in a single Org file,
in time-sorted view,
@item
a @emph{text search view} that shows all entries from multiple files
that contain specified keywords,
@item
a @emph{stuck projects view} showing projects that currently don't move
along, and
@item
@emph{custom views} that are special searches and combinations of different
views.
@end itemize

@noindent
The extracted information is displayed in a special @emph{agenda
buffer}.  This buffer is read-only, but provides commands to visit the
corresponding locations in the original Org files, and even to
edit these files remotely.

@vindex org-agenda-window-setup
@vindex org-agenda-restore-windows-after-quit
Two variables control how the agenda buffer is displayed and whether the
window configuration is restored when the agenda exits:
@code{org-agenda-window-setup} and
@code{org-agenda-restore-windows-after-quit}.

maintained in that external file.}.  If a directory is part of this list,
all files with the extension @file{.org} in this directory will be part
of the list.

Thus, even if you only work with a single Org file, that file should
be put into the list@footnote{When using the dispatcher, pressing
@kbd{<} before selecting a command will actually limit the command to
the current file, and ignore @code{org-agenda-files} until the next
dispatcher command.}.  You can customize @code{org-agenda-files}, but
the easiest way to maintain it is through the following commands

@cindex files, adding to agenda list
@table @kbd
@orgcmd{C-c [,org-agenda-file-to-front}
Add current file to the list of agenda files.  The file is added to
the front of the list.  If it was already in the list, it is moved to
the front.  With a prefix argument, file is added/moved to the end.
@orgcmd{C-c ],org-remove-file}

@kindex C-,
@cindex cycling, of agenda files
@orgcmd{C-',org-cycle-agenda-files}

Command to use an @code{iswitchb}-like interface to switch to and between Org

The Org menu contains the current list of files and can be used
to visit any of them.

If you would like to focus the agenda temporarily on a file not in
this list, or on just one file in the list, or even on only a subtree in a
file, then this can be done in different ways.  For a single agenda command,
you may press @kbd{<} once or several times in the dispatcher
(@pxref{Agenda dispatcher}).  To restrict the agenda scope for an
extended period, use the following commands:

@table @kbd
@orgcmd{C-c C-x <,org-agenda-set-restriction-lock}
Permanently restrict the agenda to the current subtree.  When with a
prefix argument, or with the cursor before the first headline in a file,
the agenda scope is set to the entire file.  This restriction remains in
effect until removed with @kbd{C-c C-x >}, or by typing either @kbd{<}
or @kbd{>} in the agenda dispatcher.  If there is a window displaying an
agenda view, the new restriction takes effect immediately.
@orgcmd{C-c C-x >,org-agenda-remove-restriction-lock}
Remove the permanent restriction created by @kbd{C-c C-x <}.
@end table

@noindent
When working with @file{speedbar.el}, you can use the following commands in
the Speedbar frame:

@table @kbd
@orgcmdtkc{< @r{in the speedbar frame},<,org-speedbar-set-agenda-restriction}
Permanently restrict the agenda to the item---either an Org file or a subtree

If there is a window displaying an agenda view, the new restriction takes

@item *
@vindex org-agenda-sticky
Toggle sticky agenda views.  By default, Org maintains only a single agenda
buffer and rebuilds it each time you change the view, to make sure everything
is always up to date.  If you switch between views often and the build time
bothers you, you can turn on sticky agenda buffers (make this the default by
customizing the variable @code{org-agenda-sticky}).  With sticky agendas, the
dispatcher only switches to the selected view, you need to update it by hand
with @kbd{r} or @kbd{g}.  You can toggle sticky agenda view any time with
@code{org-toggle-sticky-agenda}.
@end table

You can also define custom commands that will be accessible through the
dispatcher, just like the default commands.  This includes the
possibility to create extended agenda buffers that contain several
blocks together, for example the weekly agenda, the global TODO list and
a number of special tags matches.  @xref{Custom agenda views}.

@table @kbd
@cindex org-agenda, command
@orgcmd{C-c a a,org-agenda-list}
Compile an agenda for the current week from a list of Org files.  The agenda
shows the entries for each day.  With a numeric prefix@footnote{For backward

listed before the agenda.  This feature is deprecated, use the dedicated TODO
list, or a block agenda instead (@pxref{Block agenda}).}  (like @kbd{C-u 2 1
C-c a a}) you may set the number of days to be displayed.
@end table

@vindex org-agenda-span
@vindex org-agenda-ndays
@vindex org-agenda-start-day
@vindex org-agenda-start-on-weekday
The default number of days displayed in the agenda is set by the variable
@code{org-agenda-span} (or the obsolete @code{org-agenda-ndays}).  This
variable can be set to any number of days you want to see by default in the
agenda, or to a span name, such as @code{day}, @code{week}, @code{month} or
@code{year}.  For weekly agendas, the default is to start on the previous
monday (see @code{org-agenda-start-on-weekday}).  You can also set the start
date using a date shift: @code{(setq org-agenda-start-day "+10d")} will
start the agenda ten days from today in the future.

Remote editing from the agenda buffer means, for example, that you can
change the dates of deadlines and appointments from the agenda buffer.
The commands available in the Agenda buffer are listed in @ref{Agenda

@subsubheading Calendar/Diary integration
@cindex calendar integration
@cindex diary integration

Emacs contains the calendar and diary by Edward M. Reingold.  The
calendar displays a three-month calendar with holidays from different
countries and cultures.  The diary allows you to keep track of
anniversaries, lunar phases, sunrise/set, recurrent appointments
(weekly, monthly) and more.  In this way, it is quite complementary to
Org.  It can be very useful to combine output from Org with
the diary.

In order to include entries from the Emacs diary into Org mode's
agenda, you only need to customize the variable

@lisp
(setq org-agenda-include-diary t)
@end lisp

@noindent After that, everything will happen automatically.  All diary
entries including holidays, anniversaries, etc., will be included in the
agenda buffer created by Org mode.  @key{SPC}, @key{TAB}, and
@key{RET} can be used from the agenda buffer to jump to the diary
file in order to edit existing diary entries.  The @kbd{i} command to
insert new entries for the current date works in the agenda buffer, as
well as the commands @kbd{S}, @kbd{M}, and @kbd{C} to display
Sunrise/Sunset times, show lunar phases and to convert to other
calendars, respectively.  @kbd{c} can be used to switch back and forth
between calendar and agenda.

If you are using the diary only for sexp entries and holidays, it is
faster to not use the above setting, but instead to copy or even move
the entries into an Org file.  Org mode evaluates diary-style sexp
entries, and does it faster because there is no overhead for first
creating the diary display.  Note that the sexp entries must start at
the left margin, no whitespace is allowed before them.  For example,
the following segment of an Org file will be processed and entries
will be made in the agenda:

@example
* Birthdays and similar stuff
#+CATEGORY: Holiday
%%(org-calendar-holiday)   ; special function for holiday names
#+CATEGORY: Ann
%%(org-anniversary 1956  5 14)@footnote{@code{org-anniversary} is just like @code{diary-anniversary}, but the argument order is always according to ISO and therefore independent of the value of @code{calendar-date-style}.} Arthur Dent is %d years old
%%(org-anniversary 1869 10  2) Mahatma Gandhi would be %d years old
@end example

@subsubheading Anniversaries from BBDB
@cindex BBDB, anniversaries
@cindex anniversaries, from BBDB

If you are using the Big Brothers Database to store your contacts, you will
very likely prefer to store anniversaries in BBDB rather than in a
separate Org or diary file.  Org supports this and will show BBDB
anniversaries as part of the agenda.  All you need to do is to add the
following to one of your agenda files:

@example
* Anniversaries
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CATEGORY: Anniv
  :END:
%%(org-bbdb-anniversaries)
@end example

You can then go ahead and define anniversaries for a BBDB record.  Basically,
you need to press @kbd{C-o anniversary @key{RET}} with the cursor in a BBDB
record and then add the date in the format @code{YYYY-MM-DD} or @code{MM-DD},
followed by a space and the class of the anniversary (@samp{birthday} or
@samp{wedding}, or a format string).  If you omit the class, it will default to
@samp{birthday}.  Here are a few examples, the header for the file
@file{org-bbdb.el} contains more detailed information.

@example
1973-06-22
06-22
1955-08-02 wedding
2008-04-14 %s released version 6.01 of org mode, %d years ago
@end example

After a change to BBDB, or for the first agenda display during an Emacs
session, the agenda display will suffer a short delay as Org updates its
hash with anniversaries.  However, from then on things will be very fast---much
faster in fact than a long list of @samp{%%(diary-anniversary)} entries
in an Org or Diary file.

@subsubheading Appointment reminders
@cindex @file{appt.el}
@cindex appointment reminders
@cindex appointment
@cindex reminders

Org can interact with Emacs appointments notification facility.  To add the
appointments of your agenda files, use the command @code{org-agenda-to-appt}.
This command lets you filter through the list of your appointments and add
only those belonging to a specific category or matching a regular expression.
It also reads a @code{APPT_WARNTIME} property which will then override the
value of @code{appt-message-warning-time} for this appointment.  See the
docstring for details.

@node Global TODO list, Matching tags and properties, Weekly/daily agenda, Built-in agenda views
@subsection The global TODO list
@cindex global TODO list
@cindex TODO list, global

The global TODO list contains all unfinished TODO items formatted and
collected into a single place.

@table @kbd
@orgcmd{C-c a t,org-todo-list}
Show the global TODO list.  This collects the TODO items from all agenda
files (@pxref{Agenda Views}) into a single buffer.  By default, this lists
items with a state the is not a DONE state.  The buffer is in
@code{agenda-mode}, so there are commands to examine and manipulate the TODO
entries directly from that buffer (@pxref{Agenda commands}).
@orgcmd{C-c a T,org-todo-list}
@cindex TODO keyword matching
@vindex org-todo-keywords
Like the above, but allows selection of a specific TODO keyword.  You can
also do this by specifying a prefix argument to @kbd{C-c a t}.  You are
prompted for a keyword, and you may also specify several keywords by
separating them with @samp{|} as the boolean OR operator.  With a numeric
prefix, the Nth keyword in @code{org-todo-keywords} is selected.
@kindex r
The @kbd{r} key in the agenda buffer regenerates it, and you can give
a prefix argument to this command to change the selected TODO keyword,
for example @kbd{3 r}.  If you often need a search for a specific
keyword, define a custom command for it (@pxref{Agenda dispatcher}).@*
Matching specific TODO keywords can also be done as part of a tags
search (@pxref{Tag searches}).
@end table

Remote editing of TODO items means that you can change the state of a
TODO entry with a single key press.  The commands available in the
TODO list are described in @ref{Agenda commands}.

@cindex sublevels, inclusion into TODO list
Normally the global TODO list simply shows all headlines with TODO
keywords.  This list can become very long.  There are two ways to keep
it more compact:
@itemize @minus
@item
@vindex org-agenda-todo-ignore-scheduled
@vindex org-agenda-todo-ignore-deadlines
@vindex org-agenda-todo-ignore-timestamp
@vindex org-agenda-todo-ignore-with-date
Some people view a TODO item that has been @emph{scheduled} for execution or
have a @emph{deadline} (@pxref{Timestamps}) as no longer @emph{open}.
Configure the variables @code{org-agenda-todo-ignore-scheduled},
@code{org-agenda-todo-ignore-deadlines},
@code{org-agenda-todo-ignore-timestamp} and/or
@code{org-agenda-todo-ignore-with-date} to exclude such items from the global
TODO list.
@item
@vindex org-agenda-todo-list-sublevels
TODO items may have sublevels to break up the task into subtasks.  In
such cases it may be enough to list only the highest level TODO headline
and omit the sublevels from the global list.  Configure the variable
@code{org-agenda-todo-list-sublevels} to get this behavior.
@end itemize

@node Matching tags and properties, Timeline, Global TODO list, Built-in agenda views
@subsection Matching tags and properties
@cindex matching, of tags
@cindex matching, of properties
@cindex tags view
@cindex match view

If headlines in the agenda files are marked with @emph{tags} (@pxref{Tags}),
or have properties (@pxref{Properties and Columns}), you can select headlines
based on this metadata and collect them into an agenda buffer.  The match
syntax described here also applies when creating sparse trees with @kbd{C-c /
m}.

@table @kbd
@orgcmd{C-c a m,org-tags-view}
Produce a list of all headlines that match a given set of tags.  The
command prompts for a selection criterion, which is a boolean logic
expression with tags, like @samp{+work+urgent-withboss} or
@samp{work|home} (@pxref{Tags}).  If you often need a specific search,
define a custom command for it (@pxref{Agenda dispatcher}).
@orgcmd{C-c a M,org-tags-view}
@vindex org-tags-match-list-sublevels
@vindex org-agenda-tags-todo-honor-ignore-options
Like @kbd{C-c a m}, but only select headlines that are also TODO items in a
not-DONE state and force checking subitems (see variable
@code{org-tags-match-list-sublevels}).  To exclude scheduled/deadline items,
see the variable @code{org-agenda-tags-todo-honor-ignore-options}.  Matching
specific TODO keywords together with a tags match is also possible, see
@ref{Tag searches}.
@end table

The commands available in the tags list are described in @ref{Agenda
commands}.

@subsubheading Match syntax

@cindex Boolean logic, for tag/property searches
A search string can use Boolean operators @samp{&} for @code{AND} and
@samp{|} for @code{OR}@.  @samp{&} binds more strongly than @samp{|}.
Parentheses are not implemented.  Each element in the search is either a
tag, a regular expression matching tags, or an expression like
@code{PROPERTY OPERATOR VALUE} with a comparison operator, accessing a
property value.  Each element may be preceded by @samp{-}, to select
against it, and @samp{+} is syntactic sugar for positive selection.  The
@code{AND} operator @samp{&} is optional when @samp{+} or @samp{-} is
present.  Here are some examples, using only tags.

@table @samp
@item work
Select headlines tagged @samp{:work:}.
@item work&boss
Select headlines tagged @samp{:work:} and @samp{:boss:}.
@item +work-boss
Select headlines tagged @samp{:work:}, but discard those also tagged
@samp{:boss:}.
@item work|laptop
Selects lines tagged @samp{:work:} or @samp{:laptop:}.
@item work|laptop+night
Like before, but require the @samp{:laptop:} lines to be tagged also
@samp{:night:}.
@end table

@cindex regular expressions, with tags search
Instead of a tag, you may also specify a regular expression enclosed in curly
braces.  For example,
@samp{work+@{^boss.*@}} matches headlines that contain the tag
@samp{:work:} and any tag @i{starting} with @samp{boss}.

@cindex group tags, as regular expressions
Group tags (@pxref{Tag groups}) are expanded as regular expressions.  E.g.,
if @samp{:work:} is a group tag for the group @samp{:work:lab:conf:}, then
searching for @samp{work} will search for @samp{@{\(?:work\|lab\|conf\)@}}
and searching for @samp{-work} will search for all headlines but those with
one of the tag in the group (i.e., @samp{-@{\(?:work\|lab\|conf\)@}}).

@cindex TODO keyword matching, with tags search
@cindex level, require for tags/property match
@cindex category, require for tags/property match
@vindex org-odd-levels-only
You may also test for properties (@pxref{Properties and Columns}) at the same
time as matching tags.  The properties may be real properties, or special
properties that represent other metadata (@pxref{Special properties}).  For
example, the ``property'' @code{TODO} represents the TODO keyword of the
entry and the ``property'' @code{PRIORITY} represents the PRIORITY keyword of
the entry.  The ITEM special property cannot currently be used in tags/property
searches@footnote{But @pxref{x-agenda-skip-entry-regexp,
,skipping entries based on regexp}.}.

Except the @pxref{Special properties}, one other ``property'' can also be
used. @code{LEVEL} represents the level of an entry.  So a search
@samp{+LEVEL=3+boss-TODO="DONE"} lists all level three headlines that have
the tag @samp{boss} and are @emph{not} marked with the TODO keyword DONE@.
In buffers with @code{org-odd-levels-only} set, @samp{LEVEL} does not count
the number of stars, but @samp{LEVEL=2} will correspond to 3 stars etc.

Here are more examples:

@table @samp
@item work+TODO="WAITING"
Select @samp{:work:}-tagged TODO lines with the specific TODO
keyword @samp{WAITING}.
@item work+TODO="WAITING"|home+TODO="WAITING"
Waiting tasks both at work and at home.
@end table

When matching properties, a number of different operators can be used to test
the value of a property.  Here is a complex example:

@example
+work-boss+PRIORITY="A"+Coffee="unlimited"+Effort<2         \
         +With=@{Sarah\|Denny@}+SCHEDULED>="<2008-10-11>"
@end example

@noindent
The type of comparison will depend on how the comparison value is written:
@itemize @minus
@item
If the comparison value is a plain number, a numerical comparison is done,
and the allowed operators are @samp{<}, @samp{=}, @samp{>}, @samp{<=},
@samp{>=}, and @samp{<>}.
@item
If the comparison value is enclosed in double-quotes,
a string comparison is done, and the same operators are allowed.
@item
If the comparison value is enclosed in double-quotes @emph{and} angular
brackets (like @samp{DEADLINE<="<2008-12-24 18:30>"}), both values are
assumed to be date/time specifications in the standard Org way, and the
comparison will be done accordingly.  Special values that will be recognized
are @code{"<now>"} for now (including time), and @code{"<today>"}, and
@code{"<tomorrow>"} for these days at 00:00 hours, i.e., without a time
specification.  Also strings like @code{"<+5d>"} or @code{"<-2m>"} with units
@code{d}, @code{w}, @code{m}, and @code{y} for day, week, month, and year,
respectively, can be used.
@item
If the comparison value is enclosed
in curly braces, a regexp match is performed, with @samp{=} meaning that the
regexp matches the property value, and @samp{<>} meaning that it does not
match.
@end itemize

So the search string in the example finds entries tagged @samp{:work:} but
not @samp{:boss:}, which also have a priority value @samp{A}, a
@samp{:Coffee:} property with the value @samp{unlimited}, an @samp{Effort}
property that is numerically smaller than 2, a @samp{:With:} property that is
matched by the regular expression @samp{Sarah\|Denny}, and that are scheduled
on or after October 11, 2008.

Accessing TODO, LEVEL, and CATEGORY during a search is fast.  Accessing any
other properties will slow down the search.  However, once you have paid the
price by accessing one property, testing additional properties is cheap
again.

You can configure Org mode to use property inheritance during a search, but
beware that this can slow down searches considerably.  See @ref{Property
inheritance}, for details.

For backward compatibility, and also for typing speed, there is also a
different way to test TODO states in a search.  For this, terminate the
tags/property part of the search string (which may include several terms
connected with @samp{|}) with a @samp{/} and then specify a Boolean
expression just for TODO keywords.  The syntax is then similar to that for
tags, but should be applied with care: for example, a positive selection on
several TODO keywords cannot meaningfully be combined with boolean AND@.
However, @emph{negative selection} combined with AND can be meaningful.  To
make sure that only lines are checked that actually have any TODO keyword
(resulting in a speed-up), use @kbd{C-c a M}, or equivalently start the TODO
part after the slash with @samp{!}.  Using @kbd{C-c a M} or @samp{/!} will
not match TODO keywords in a DONE state.  Examples:

@table @samp
@item work/WAITING
Same as @samp{work+TODO="WAITING"}
@item work/!-WAITING-NEXT
Select @samp{:work:}-tagged TODO lines that are neither @samp{WAITING}
nor @samp{NEXT}
@item work/!+WAITING|+NEXT
Select @samp{:work:}-tagged TODO lines that are either @samp{WAITING} or
@samp{NEXT}.

@table @kbd
@orgcmd{C-c a L,org-timeline}

@subsection Search view
@cindex search view
@cindex text search
@cindex searching, for text

This agenda view is a general text search facility for Org mode entries.
It is particularly useful to find notes.

@table @kbd
@orgcmd{C-c a s,org-search-view}
This is a special search that lets you select entries by matching a substring
or specific words using a boolean logic.
@end table
For example, the search string @samp{computer equipment} will find entries
that contain @samp{computer equipment} as a substring.  If the two words are
separated by more space or a line break, the search will still match.
Search view can also search for specific keywords in the entry, using Boolean
logic.  The search string @samp{+computer +wifi -ethernet -@{8\.11[bg]@}}
will search for note entries that contain the keywords @code{computer}
and @code{wifi}, but not the keyword @code{ethernet}, and which are also
not matched by the regular expression @code{8\.11[bg]}, meaning to
exclude both 8.11b and 8.11g.  The first @samp{+} is necessary to turn on
word search, other @samp{+} characters are optional.  For more details, see
the docstring of the command @code{org-search-view}.

@vindex org-agenda-text-search-extra-files
Note that in addition to the agenda files, this command will also search

@node Stuck projects,  , Search view, Built-in agenda views
@subsection Stuck projects
@pindex GTD, Getting Things Done

If you are following a system like David Allen's GTD to organize your
work, one of the ``duties'' you have is a regular review to make sure
that all projects move along.  A @emph{stuck} project is a project that
has no defined next actions, so it will never show up in the TODO lists
Org mode produces.  During the review, you need to identify such
projects and define next actions for them.

@table @kbd
@orgcmd{C-c a #,org-agenda-list-stuck-projects}
List projects that are stuck.
@kindex C-c a !
@item C-c a !
@vindex org-stuck-projects
Customize the variable @code{org-stuck-projects} to define what a stuck
project is and how to find it.
@end table

You almost certainly will have to configure this view before it will
work for you.  The built-in default assumes that all your projects are
level-2 headlines, and that a project is not stuck if it has at least
one entry marked with a TODO keyword TODO or NEXT or NEXTACTION.

Let's assume that you, in your own way of using Org mode, identify
projects with a tag PROJECT, and that you use a TODO keyword MAYBE to
indicate a project that should not be considered yet.  Let's further
assume that the TODO keyword DONE marks finished projects, and that NEXT
and TODO indicate next actions.  The tag @@SHOP indicates shopping and
is a next action even without the NEXT tag.  Finally, if the project
contains the special word IGNORE anywhere, it should not be listed
either.  In this case you would start by identifying eligible projects
with a tags/todo match@footnote{@xref{Tag searches}.}
@samp{+PROJECT/-MAYBE-DONE}, and then check for TODO, NEXT, @@SHOP, and
IGNORE in the subtree to identify projects that are not stuck.  The
correct customization for this is

@lisp
(setq org-stuck-projects
      '("+PROJECT/-MAYBE-DONE" ("NEXT" "TODO") ("@@SHOP")
                               "\\<IGNORE\\>"))
@end lisp

Note that if a project is identified as non-stuck, the subtree of this entry
will still be searched for stuck projects.

Before displaying items in an agenda view, Org mode visually prepares the

with a @emph{prefix} that contains the @emph{category} (@pxref{Categories})
of the item and other important information.  You can customize in which
column tags will be displayed through @code{org-agenda-tags-column}.  You can

This prefix is followed by a cleaned-up version of the outline headline

@cindex category
@cindex #+CATEGORY
The category is a broad label assigned to each agenda item.  By default,
the category is simply derived from the file name, but you can also
specify it with a special line in the buffer, like this@footnote{For
backward compatibility, the following also works: if there are several
such lines in a file, each specifies the category for the text below it.
The first category also applies to any text before the first CATEGORY
line.  However, using this method is @emph{strongly} deprecated as it is
incompatible with the outline structure of the document.  The correct
method for setting multiple categories in a buffer is using a
property.}:

@example
#+CATEGORY: Thesis
@end example

@noindent
@cindex property, CATEGORY
If you would like to have a special CATEGORY for a single entry or a
(sub)tree, give the entry a @code{:CATEGORY:} property with the
special category you want to apply as the value.

@noindent
The display in the agenda buffer looks best if the category is not
longer than 10 characters.

@noindent
You can set up icons for category by customizing the
@code{org-agenda-category-icon-alist} variable.

@node Time-of-day specifications, Sorting agenda items, Categories, Presentation and sorting
@subsection Time-of-day specifications
@cindex time-of-day specification

Org mode checks each agenda item for a time-of-day specification.  The
time can be part of the timestamp that triggered inclusion into the
agenda, for example as in @w{@samp{<2005-05-10 Tue 19:00>}}.  Time
ranges can be specified with two timestamps, like
@c
@w{@samp{<2005-05-10 Tue 20:30>--<2005-05-10 Tue 22:15>}}.

In the headline of the entry itself, a time(range) may also appear as
plain text (like @samp{12:45} or a @samp{8:30-1pm}).  If the agenda
integrates the Emacs diary (@pxref{Weekly/daily agenda}), time
specifications in diary entries are recognized as well.

For agenda display, Org mode extracts the time and displays it in a
standard 24 hour format as part of the prefix.  The example times in
the previous paragraphs would end up in the agenda like this:

@example
    8:30-13:00 Arthur Dent lies in front of the bulldozer
   12:45...... Ford Prefect arrives and takes Arthur to the pub
   19:00...... The Vogon reads his poem
   20:30-22:15 Marvin escorts the Hitchhikers to the bridge
@end example

@cindex time grid
If the agenda is in single-day mode, or for the display of today, the
timed entries are embedded in a time grid, like

@subsection Sorting agenda items
@cindex sorting, of agenda items
@cindex priorities, of agenda items
Before being inserted into a view, the items are sorted.  How this is
done depends on the type of view.
@itemize @bullet
@item
@vindex org-agenda-files
For the daily/weekly agenda, the items for each day are sorted.  The
default order is to first collect all items containing an explicit
time-of-day specification.  These entries will be shown at the beginning
of the list, as a @emph{schedule} for the day.  After that, items remain
grouped in categories, in the sequence given by @code{org-agenda-files}.
Within each category, items are sorted by priority (@pxref{Priorities}),
which is composed of the base priority (2000 for priority @samp{A}, 1000
for @samp{B}, and 0 for @samp{C}), plus additional increments for
overdue scheduled or deadline items.
@item
For the TODO list, items remain in the order of categories, but within
each category, sorting takes place according to priority
(@pxref{Priorities}).  The priority used for sorting derives from the
priority cookie, with additions depending on how close an item is to its due
or scheduled date.
@item
For tags matches, items are not sorted at all, but just appear in the
sequence in which they are found in the agenda files.
@end itemize

@vindex org-agenda-sorting-strategy
Sorting can be customized using the variable
@code{org-agenda-sorting-strategy}, and may also include criteria based on
the estimated effort of an entry (@pxref{Effort estimates}).

@subsection Filtering/limiting agenda items

Agenda built-in or customized commands are statically defined.  Agenda
filters and limits provide two ways of dynamically narrowing down the list of
agenda entries: @emph{fitlers} and @emph{limits}.  Filters only act on the
display of the items, while limits take effect before the list of agenda
entries is built.  Filter are more often used interactively, while limits are
mostly useful when defined as local variables within custom agenda commands.

@subsubheading Filtering in the agenda

@cindex query editing, in agenda

@table @kbd
@orgcmd{/,org-agenda-filter-by-tag}
@vindex org-agenda-tag-filter-preset
Filter the agenda view with respect to a tag and/or effort estimates.  The
difference between this and a custom agenda command is that filtering is very
fast, so that you can switch quickly between different filters without having
to recreate the agenda.@footnote{Custom commands can preset a filter by
binding the variable @code{org-agenda-tag-filter-preset} as an option.  This
filter will then be applied to the view and persist as a basic filter through
refreshes and more secondary filtering.  The filter is a global property of
the entire agenda view---in a block agenda, you should only set this in the
global options section, not in the section of an individual block.}

You will be prompted for a tag selection letter; @key{SPC} will mean any tag at
all.  Pressing @key{TAB} at that prompt will offer use completion to select a
tag (including any tags that do not have a selection character).  The command
then hides all entries that do not contain or inherit this tag.  When called
with prefix arg, remove the entries that @emph{do} have the tag.  A second
@kbd{/} at the prompt will turn off the filter and unhide any hidden entries.
If the first key you press is either @kbd{+} or @kbd{-}, the previous filter
will be narrowed by requiring or forbidding the selected additional tag.
Instead of pressing @kbd{+} or @kbd{-} after @kbd{/}, you can also
immediately use the @kbd{\} command.

@vindex org-sort-agenda-noeffort-is-high
In order to filter for effort estimates, you should set up allowed
efforts globally, for example
@lisp
(setq org-global-properties
    '(("Effort_ALL". "0 0:10 0:30 1:00 2:00 3:00 4:00")))
@end lisp
You can then filter for an effort by first typing an operator, one of
@kbd{<}, @kbd{>}, and @kbd{=}, and then the one-digit index of an effort
estimate in your array of allowed values, where @kbd{0} means the 10th value.
The filter will then restrict to entries with effort smaller-or-equal, equal,
or larger-or-equal than the selected value.  If the digits 0--9 are not used
as fast access keys to tags, you can also simply press the index digit
directly without an operator.  In this case, @kbd{<} will be assumed.  For
application of the operator, entries without a defined effort will be treated
according to the value of @code{org-sort-agenda-noeffort-is-high}.  To filter
for tasks without effort definition, press @kbd{?} as the operator.

Org also supports automatic, context-aware tag filtering.  If the variable
@code{org-agenda-auto-exclude-function} is set to a user-defined function,
that function can decide which tags should be excluded from the agenda
automatically.  Once this is set, the @kbd{/} command then accepts @kbd{RET}
as a sub-option key and runs the auto exclusion logic.  For example, let's
say you use a @code{Net} tag to identify tasks which need network access, an
@code{Errand} tag for errands in town, and a @code{Call} tag for making phone
calls.  You could auto-exclude these tags based on the availability of the
Internet, and outside of business hours, with something like this:

@smalllisp
@group
(defun org-my-auto-exclude-function (tag)
  (and (cond
        ((string= tag "Net")
         (/= 0 (call-process "/sbin/ping" nil nil nil
                             "-c1" "-q" "-t1" "mail.gnu.org")))
        ((or (string= tag "Errand") (string= tag "Call"))
         (let ((hour (nth 2 (decode-time))))
           (or (< hour 8) (> hour 21)))))
       (concat "-" tag)))

(setq org-agenda-auto-exclude-function 'org-my-auto-exclude-function)
@end group
@end smalllisp

@orgcmd{\\,org-agenda-filter-by-tag-refine}
Narrow the current agenda filter by an additional condition.  When called with
prefix arg, remove the entries that @emph{do} have the tag, or that do match
the effort criterion.  You can achieve the same effect by pressing @kbd{+} or
@kbd{-} as the first key after the @kbd{/} command.

@c
@kindex [
@kindex ]
@kindex @{
@kindex @}
@item [ ] @{ @}
@table @i
@item @r{in} search view
add new search words (@kbd{[} and @kbd{]}) or new regular expressions
(@kbd{@{} and @kbd{@}}) to the query string.  The opening bracket/brace will
add a positive search term prefixed by @samp{+}, indicating that this search
term @i{must} occur/match in the entry.  The closing bracket/brace will add a
negative search term which @i{must not} occur/match in the entry for it to be
selected.
@end table

@orgcmd{<,org-agenda-filter-by-category}
@vindex org-agenda-category-filter-preset

Filter the current agenda view with respect to the category of the item at
point.  Pressing @code{<} another time will remove this filter.  You can add
a filter preset through the option @code{org-agenda-category-filter-preset}
(see below.)

@orgcmd{^,org-agenda-filter-by-top-headline}
Filter the current agenda view and only display the siblings and the parent
headline of the one at point.

@orgcmd{=,org-agenda-filter-by-regexp}
@vindex org-agenda-regexp-filter-preset

Filter the agenda view by a regular expression: only show agenda entries
matching the regular expression the user entered.  When called with a prefix
argument, it will filter @emph{out} entries matching the regexp.  With two
universal prefix arguments, it will remove all the regexp filters, which can
be accumulated.  You can add a filter preset through the option
@code{org-agenda-category-filter-preset} (see below.)

@orgcmd{|,org-agenda-filter-remove-all}
Remove all filters in the current agenda view.

@cindex limits, in agenda
@vindex org-agenda-max-entries
@vindex org-agenda-max-effort
@vindex org-agenda-max-todos
@vindex org-agenda-max-tags

Here is a list of options that you can set, either globally, or locally in
your custom agenda views@pxref{Custom agenda views}.

@table @var
@item org-agenda-max-entries
Limit the number of entries.
@item org-agenda-max-effort
Limit the duration of accumulated efforts (as minutes).
@item org-agenda-max-todos
Limit the number of entries with TODO keywords.
@item org-agenda-max-tags
Limit the number of tagged entries.
@end table

When set to a positive integer, each option will exclude entries from other
categories: for example, @code{(setq org-agenda-max-effort 100)} will limit
the agenda to 100 minutes of effort and exclude any entry that as no effort
property.  If you want to include entries with no effort property, use a
negative value for @code{org-agenda-max-effort}.

One useful setup is to use @code{org-agenda-max-entries} locally in a custom
command.  For example, this custom command will display the next five entries
with a @code{NEXT} TODO keyword.

@smalllisp
(setq org-agenda-custom-commands
      '(("n" todo "NEXT"
         ((org-agenda-max-entries 5)))))
@end smalllisp

Once you mark one of these five entry as @code{DONE}, rebuilding the agenda
will again the next five entries again, including the first entry that was
excluded so far.

You can also dynamically set temporary limits@footnote{Those temporary limits
are lost when rebuilding the agenda.}:

@table @kbd
@orgcmd{~,org-agenda-limit-interactively}
This prompts for the type of limit to apply and its value.
@end table

@node Agenda commands, Custom agenda views, Presentation and sorting, Agenda Views
@section Commands in the agenda buffer
@cindex commands, in agenda buffer

Entries in the agenda buffer are linked back to the Org file or diary
file where they originate.  You are not allowed to edit the agenda
buffer itself, but commands are provided to show and jump to the
original entry location, and to edit the Org files ``remotely'' from
the agenda buffer.  In this way, all information is stored only once,
removing the risk that your agenda and note files may diverge.

Some commands can be executed with mouse clicks on agenda lines.  For
the other commands, the cursor needs to be in the desired line.

@table @kbd
@tsubheading{Motion}
@cindex motion commands in agenda
@orgcmd{n,org-agenda-next-line}
Next line (same as @key{down} and @kbd{C-n}).

Previous line (same as @key{up} and @kbd{C-p}).
@tsubheading{View/Go to Org file}
@orgcmdkkc{@key{SPC},mouse-3,org-agenda-show-and-scroll-up}
Display the original location of the item in another window.
With prefix arg, make sure that the entire entry is made visible in the

@c
@orgcmd{L,org-agenda-recenter}
Display original location and recenter that window.
@c
@orgcmdkkc{@key{TAB},mouse-2,org-agenda-goto}

Go to the original location of the item and delete other windows.
@c
@orgcmd{F,org-agenda-follow-mode}
@vindex org-agenda-start-with-follow-mode
Toggle Follow mode.  In Follow mode, as you move the cursor through
the agenda buffer, the other window always shows the corresponding
location in the Org file.  The initial setting for this mode in new
agenda buffers can be set with the variable
@code{org-agenda-start-with-follow-mode}.
@c
@orgcmd{C-c C-x b,org-agenda-tree-to-indirect-buffer}
Display the entire subtree of the current item in an indirect buffer.  With a
numeric prefix argument N, go up to level N and then take that tree.  If N is
negative, go up that many levels.  With a @kbd{C-u} prefix, do not remove the
previously used indirect buffer.

@orgcmd{C-c C-o,org-agenda-open-link}
Follow a link in the entry.  This will offer a selection of any links in the
text belonging to the referenced Org node.  If there is only one link, it
will be followed without a selection prompt.

@vindex org-agenda-span
Switch to day/week/month/year view.  When switching to day or week view, this
setting becomes the default for subsequent agenda refreshes.  Since month and
year views are slow to create, they do not become the default.  A numeric
prefix argument may be used to jump directly to a specific day of the year,
ISO week, month, or year, respectively.  For example, @kbd{32 d} jumps to
February 1st, @kbd{9 w} to ISO week number 9.  When setting day, week, or
month view, a year may be encoded in the prefix argument as well.  For
example, @kbd{200712 w} will jump to week 12 in 2007.  If such a year
specification has only one or two digits, it will be mapped to the interval
1938--2037.  @kbd{v @key{SPC}} will reset to what is set in
@code{org-agenda-span}.
@c
@orgcmd{f,org-agenda-later}

entries that have been clocked on that day.  You can configure the entry
types that should be included in log mode using the variable
@code{org-agenda-log-mode-items}.  When called with a @kbd{C-u} prefix, show
all possible logbook entries, including state changes.  When called with two
prefix arguments @kbd{C-u C-u}, show only logging information, nothing else.
@kbd{v L} is equivalent to @kbd{C-u v l}.

always show a table with the clocked times for the time span and file scope
covered by the current agenda view.  The initial setting for this mode in new
agenda buffers can be set with the variable
@code{org-agenda-start-with-clockreport-mode}.  By using a prefix argument
when toggling this mode (i.e., @kbd{C-u R}), the clock table will not show
contributions from entries that are hidden by agenda filtering@footnote{Only

Recreate the agenda buffer, for example to reflect the changes after
modification of the timestamps of items with @kbd{S-@key{left}} and
@kbd{S-@key{right}}.  When the buffer is the global TODO list, a prefix
argument is interpreted to create a selective list for a specific TODO

@orgcmd{B,org-agenda-bulk-action}
Bulk action: act on all marked entries in the agenda.  This will prompt for
another key to select the action to be applied.  The prefix arg to @kbd{B}
will be passed through to the @kbd{s} and @kbd{d} commands, to bulk-remove
these special timestamps.  By default, marks are removed after the bulk.  If
you want them to persist, set @code{org-agenda-bulk-persistent-marks} to
@code{t} or hit @kbd{p} at the prompt.

@table @kbd
@item *
Toggle persistent marks.
@item $
Archive all selected entries.
@item A
Archive entries by moving them to their respective archive siblings.
@item t
Change TODO state.  This prompts for a single TODO keyword and changes the
state of all selected entries, bypassing blocking and suppressing logging
notes (but not timestamps).
@item +
Add a tag to all selected entries.
@item -
Remove a tag from all selected entries.
@item s
Schedule all items to a new date.  To shift existing schedule dates by a
fixed number of days, use something starting with double plus at the prompt,
for example @samp{++8d} or @samp{++2w}.
@item d
Set deadline to a specific date.
@item r
Prompt for a single refile target and move all entries.  The entries will no
longer be in the agenda; refresh (@kbd{g}) to bring them back.
@item S
Reschedule randomly into the coming N days.  N will be prompted for.  With
prefix arg (@kbd{C-u B S}), scatter only across weekdays.
@item f
Apply a function@footnote{You can also create persistent custom functions
through @code{org-agenda-bulk-custom-functions}.} to marked entries.  For
example, the function below sets the CATEGORY property of the entries to web.

@lisp
@group

@tsubheading{Calendar commands}
@cindex calendar commands, from agenda

@orgcmd{c,org-agenda-goto-calendar}
Open the Emacs calendar and move to the date at the agenda cursor.
@c
@orgcmd{c,org-calendar-goto-agenda}
When in the calendar, compute and show the Org mode agenda for the
date at the cursor.
@c
@cindex diary entries, creating from agenda
@orgcmd{i,org-agenda-diary-entry}
@vindex org-agenda-diary-file
Insert a new entry into the diary, using the date at the cursor and (for
block entries) the date at the mark.  This will add to the Emacs diary
file@footnote{This file is parsed for the agenda when
@code{org-agenda-include-diary} is set.}, in a way similar to the @kbd{i}
command in the calendar.  The diary file will pop up in another window, where
you can add the entry.

If you configure @code{org-agenda-diary-file} to point to an Org mode file,
Org will create entries (in Org mode syntax) in that file instead.  Most
entries will be stored in a date-based outline tree that will later make it
easy to archive appointments from previous months/years.  The tree will be
built under an entry with a @code{DATE_TREE} property, or else with years as
top-level entries.  Emacs will prompt you for the entry text---if you specify
it, the entry will be created in @code{org-agenda-diary-file} without further
interaction.  If you directly press @key{RET} at the prompt without typing
text, the target file will be shown in another window for you to finish the
entry there.  See also the @kbd{k r} command.
@c
@orgcmd{M,org-agenda-phases-of-moon}
Show the phases of the moon for the three months around current date.
@c
@orgcmd{S,org-agenda-sunrise-sunset}
Show sunrise and sunset times.  The geographical location must be set
with calendar variables, see the documentation for the Emacs calendar.
@c
@orgcmd{C,org-agenda-convert-date}
Convert the date at cursor into many other cultural and historic
calendars.
@c
@orgcmd{H,org-agenda-holidays}
Show holidays for three months around the cursor date.

@item M-x org-icalendar-combine-agenda-files RET
Export a single iCalendar file containing entries from all agenda files.
This is a globally available command, and also available in the agenda menu.

@tsubheading{Exporting to a file}
@orgcmd{C-x C-w,org-agenda-write}
@cindex exporting agenda views
@cindex agenda views, exporting
@vindex org-agenda-exporter-settings
Write the agenda view to a file.  Depending on the extension of the selected
file name, the view will be exported as HTML (@file{.html} or @file{.htm}),
Postscript (@file{.ps}), PDF (@file{.pdf}), Org (@file{.org}) and plain text
(any other extension).  When exporting to Org, only the body of original
headlines are exported, not subtrees or inherited tags.  When called with a
@kbd{C-u} prefix argument, immediately open the newly created file.  Use the
variable @code{org-agenda-exporter-settings} to set options for
@file{ps-print} and for @file{htmlize} to be used during export.

@tsubheading{Quit and Exit}

Custom agenda commands serve two purposes: to store and quickly access
frequently used TODO and tags searches, and to create special composite
agenda buffers.  Custom agenda commands will be accessible through the
dispatcher (@pxref{Agenda dispatcher}), just like the default commands.

@menu

@end menu

@node Storing searches, Block agenda, Custom agenda views, Custom agenda views
@subsection Storing searches

The first application of custom searches is the definition of keyboard
shortcuts for frequently used searches, either creating an agenda
buffer, or a sparse tree (the latter covering of course only the current
buffer).
@kindex C-c a C
@vindex org-agenda-custom-commands
@cindex agenda views, main example
@cindex agenda, as an agenda views
@cindex agenda*, as an agenda views
@cindex tags, as an agenda view
@cindex todo, as an agenda view
@cindex tags-todo
@cindex todo-tree
@cindex occur-tree
@cindex tags-tree

Custom commands are configured in the variable
@code{org-agenda-custom-commands}.  You can customize this variable, for
example by pressing @kbd{C-c a C}.  You can also directly set it with Emacs
Lisp in @file{.emacs}.  The following example contains all valid agenda
views:

@lisp
@group
(setq org-agenda-custom-commands
      '(("x" agenda)
        ("y" agenda*)
        ("w" todo "WAITING")
        ("W" todo-tree "WAITING")
        ("u" tags "+boss-urgent")
        ("v" tags-todo "+boss-urgent")
        ("U" tags-tree "+boss-urgent")
        ("f" occur-tree "\\<FIXME\\>")
        ("h" . "HOME+Name tags searches") ; description for "h" prefix
        ("hl" tags "+home+Lisa")
        ("hp" tags "+home+Peter")
        ("hk" tags "+home+Kim")))
@end group
@end lisp

@noindent
The initial string in each entry defines the keys you have to press
after the dispatcher command @kbd{C-c a} in order to access the command.
Usually this will be just a single character, but if you have many
similar commands, you can also define two-letter combinations where the
first character is the same in several combinations and serves as a
prefix key@footnote{You can provide a description for a prefix key by
inserting a cons cell with the prefix and the description.}.  The second
parameter is the search type, followed by the string or regular
expression to be used for the matching.  The example above will
therefore define:

@table @kbd
@item C-c a x
as a global search for agenda entries planned@footnote{@emph{Planned} means
here that these entries have some planning information attached to them, like
a time-stamp, a scheduled or a deadline string.  See
@code{org-agenda-entry-types} on how to set what planning information will be
taken into account.} this week/day.
@item C-c a y
as a global search for agenda entries planned this week/day, but only those
with an hour specification like @code{[h]h:mm}---think of them as appointments.
@item C-c a w
as a global search for TODO entries with @samp{WAITING} as the TODO
keyword
@item C-c a W
as the same search, but only in the current buffer and displaying the
results as a sparse tree
@item C-c a u
as a global tags search for headlines marked @samp{:boss:} but not
@samp{:urgent:}
@item C-c a v
as the same search as @kbd{C-c a u}, but limiting the search to
headlines that are also TODO items
@item C-c a U
as the same search as @kbd{C-c a u}, but only in the current buffer and
displaying the result as a sparse tree
@item C-c a f
to create a sparse tree (again: current buffer only) with all entries
containing the word @samp{FIXME}
@item C-c a h
as a prefix command for a HOME tags search where you have to press an
additional key (@kbd{l}, @kbd{p} or @kbd{k}) to select a name (Lisa,
Peter, or Kim) as additional tag to match.
@end table

Note that the @code{*-tree} agenda views need to be called from an
Org buffer as they operate on the current buffer only.

@node Block agenda, Setting Options, Storing searches, Custom agenda views
@subsection Block agenda
@cindex block agenda
@cindex agenda, with block views

Another possibility is the construction of agenda views that comprise
the results of @emph{several} commands, each of which creates a block in
the agenda buffer.  The available commands include @code{agenda} for the
daily or weekly agenda (as created with @kbd{C-c a a}), @code{alltodo}
for the global TODO list (as constructed with @kbd{C-c a t}), and the
matching commands discussed above: @code{todo}, @code{tags}, and
@code{tags-todo}.  Here are two examples:

@lisp
@group
(setq org-agenda-custom-commands
      '(("h" "Agenda and Home-related tasks"
         ((agenda "")
          (tags-todo "home")
          (tags "garden")))
        ("o" "Agenda and Office-related tasks"
         ((agenda "")
          (tags-todo "work")
          (tags "office")))))
@end group
@end lisp

@noindent
This will define @kbd{C-c a h} to create a multi-block view for stuff
you need to attend to at home.  The resulting agenda buffer will contain
your agenda for the current week, all TODO items that carry the tag
@samp{home}, and also all lines tagged with @samp{garden}.  Finally the
command @kbd{C-c a o} provides a similar view for office tasks.

@node Setting Options,  , Block agenda, Custom agenda views
@subsection Setting options for custom commands
@cindex options, for custom agenda views

@vindex org-agenda-custom-commands
Org mode contains a number of variables regulating agenda construction
and display.  The global variables define the behavior for all agenda
commands, including the custom commands.  However, if you want to change
some settings just for a single custom view, you can do so.  Setting
options requires inserting a list of variable names and values at the
right spot in @code{org-agenda-custom-commands}.  For example:

@lisp
@group
(setq org-agenda-custom-commands
      '(("w" todo "WAITING"
         ((org-agenda-sorting-strategy '(priority-down))
          (org-agenda-prefix-format "  Mixed: ")))
        ("U" tags-tree "+boss-urgent"
         ((org-show-following-heading nil)
          (org-show-hierarchy-above nil)))
        ("N" search ""
         ((org-agenda-files '("~org/notes.org"))
          (org-agenda-text-search-extra-files nil)))))
@end group
@end lisp

@noindent
Now the @kbd{C-c a w} command will sort the collected entries only by
priority, and the prefix format is modified to just say @samp{  Mixed: }
instead of giving the category of the entry.  The sparse tags tree of
@kbd{C-c a U} will now turn out ultra-compact, because neither the
headline hierarchy above the match, nor the headline following the match
will be shown.  The command @kbd{C-c a N} will do a text search limited
to only a single file.

@vindex org-agenda-custom-commands
For command sets creating a block agenda,
@code{org-agenda-custom-commands} has two separate spots for setting
options.  You can add options that should be valid for just a single
command in the set, and options that should be valid for all commands in
the set.  The former are just added to the command entry; the latter
must come after the list of command entries.  Going back to the block
agenda example (@pxref{Block agenda}), let's change the sorting strategy
for the @kbd{C-c a h} commands to @code{priority-down}, but let's sort
the results for GARDEN tags query in the opposite order,
@code{priority-up}.  This would look like this:

@lisp
@group
(setq org-agenda-custom-commands
      '(("h" "Agenda and Home-related tasks"
         ((agenda)
          (tags-todo "home")
          (tags "garden"
                ((org-agenda-sorting-strategy '(priority-up)))))
         ((org-agenda-sorting-strategy '(priority-down))))
        ("o" "Agenda and Office-related tasks"
         ((agenda)
          (tags-todo "work")
          (tags "office")))))
@end group
@end lisp

As you see, the values and parentheses setting is a little complex.
When in doubt, use the customize interface to set this variable---it
fully supports its structure.  Just one caveat: when setting options in
this interface, the @emph{values} are just Lisp expressions.  So if the
value is a string, you need to add the double-quotes around the value
yourself.

@vindex org-agenda-custom-commands-contexts
To control whether an agenda command should be accessible from a specific
context, you can customize @code{org-agenda-custom-commands-contexts}.  Let's
say for example that you have an agenda commands @code{"o"} displaying a view
that you only need when reading emails.  Then you would configure this option
like this:

@lisp
(setq org-agenda-custom-commands-contexts
      '(("o" (in-mode . "message-mode"))))
@end lisp

You can also tell that the command key @code{"o"} should refer to another
command key @code{"r"}.  In that case, add this command key like this:

@lisp
(setq org-agenda-custom-commands-contexts
      '(("o" "r" (in-mode . "message-mode"))))
@end lisp

See the docstring of the variable for more information.

@node Exporting Agenda Views, Agenda column view, Custom agenda views, Agenda Views
@section Exporting Agenda Views
@cindex agenda views, exporting

If you are away from your computer, it can be very useful to have a printed
version of some agenda views to carry around.  Org mode can export custom
agenda views as plain text, HTML@footnote{You need to install Hrvoje Niksic's
@file{htmlize.el}.}, Postscript, PDF@footnote{To create PDF output, the
ghostscript @file{ps2pdf} utility must be installed on the system.  Selecting
a PDF file will also create the postscript file.}, and iCalendar files.  If
you want to do this only occasionally, use the command

@table @kbd
@orgcmd{C-x C-w,org-agenda-write}
@cindex exporting agenda views
@cindex agenda views, exporting
@vindex org-agenda-exporter-settings
Write the agenda view to a file.  Depending on the extension of the selected
file name, the view will be exported as HTML (extension @file{.html} or
@file{.htm}), Postscript (extension @file{.ps}), iCalendar (extension
@file{.ics}), or plain text (any other extension).  Use the variable
@code{org-agenda-exporter-settings} to set options for @file{ps-print} and
for @file{htmlize} to be used during export, for example

@vindex org-agenda-add-entry-text-maxlines
@vindex htmlize-output-type
@vindex ps-number-of-columns
@vindex ps-landscape-mode
@lisp
(setq org-agenda-exporter-settings
      '((ps-number-of-columns 2)
        (ps-landscape-mode t)
        (org-agenda-add-entry-text-maxlines 5)
        (htmlize-output-type 'css)))
@end lisp
@end table

If you need to export certain agenda views frequently, you can associate
any custom agenda command with a list of output file names
@footnote{If you want to store standard views like the weekly agenda
or the global TODO list as well, you need to define custom commands for
them in order to be able to specify file names.}.  Here is an example
that first defines custom commands for the agenda and the global
TODO list, together with a number of files to which to export them.
Then we define two block agenda commands and specify file names for them
as well.  File names can be relative to the current working directory,
or absolute.

@lisp
@group
(setq org-agenda-custom-commands
      '(("X" agenda "" nil ("agenda.html" "agenda.ps"))
        ("Y" alltodo "" nil ("todo.html" "todo.txt" "todo.ps"))
        ("h" "Agenda and Home-related tasks"
         ((agenda "")
          (tags-todo "home")
          (tags "garden"))
         nil
         ("~/views/home.html"))
        ("o" "Agenda and Office-related tasks"
         ((agenda)
          (tags-todo "work")
          (tags "office"))
         nil
         ("~/views/office.ps" "~/calendars/office.ics"))))
@end group
@end lisp

The extension of the file name determines the type of export.  If it is
@file{.html}, Org mode will use the @file{htmlize.el} package to convert
the buffer to HTML and save it to this file name.  If the extension is
@file{.ps}, @code{ps-print-buffer-with-faces} is used to produce
Postscript output.  If the extension is @file{.ics}, iCalendar export is
run export over all files that were used to construct the agenda, and
limit the export to entries listed in the agenda.  Any other
extension produces a plain ASCII file.

The export files are @emph{not} created when you use one of those
commands interactively because this might use too much overhead.
Instead, there is a special command to produce @emph{all} specified
files in one step:

@table @kbd
@orgcmd{C-c a e,org-store-agenda-views}
Export all agenda views that have export file names associated with
them.
@end table

You can use the options section of the custom agenda commands to also
set options for the export commands.  For example:

@lisp
(setq org-agenda-custom-commands
      '(("X" agenda ""
         ((ps-number-of-columns 2)
          (ps-landscape-mode t)
          (org-agenda-prefix-format " [ ] ")
          (org-agenda-with-colors nil)
          (org-agenda-remove-tags t))
         ("theagenda.ps"))))
@end lisp

@noindent
This command sets two options for the Postscript exporter, to make it
print in two columns in landscape format---the resulting page can be cut
in two and then used in a paper agenda.  The remaining settings modify
the agenda prefix to omit category and scheduling information, and
instead include a checkbox to check off items.  We also remove the tags
to make the lines compact, and we don't want to use colors for the
black-and-white printer.  Settings specified in
@code{org-agenda-exporter-settings} will also apply, but the settings
in @code{org-agenda-custom-commands} take precedence.

@noindent
From the command line you may also use
@example
emacs -eval (org-batch-store-agenda-views) -kill
@end example
@noindent
or, if you need to modify some parameters@footnote{Quoting depends on the
system you use, please check the FAQ for examples.}
@example
emacs -eval '(org-batch-store-agenda-views                      \
              org-agenda-span (quote month)                     \
              org-agenda-start-day "2007-11-01"                 \
              org-agenda-include-diary nil                      \
              org-agenda-files (quote ("~/org/project.org")))'  \
      -kill
@end example
@noindent
which will create the agenda views restricted to the file
@file{~/org/project.org}, without diary entries and with a 30-day
extent.

You can also extract agenda information in a way that allows further
processing by other programs.  See @ref{Extracting agenda information}, for
more information.


@node Agenda column view,  , Exporting Agenda Views, Agenda Views
@section Using column view in the agenda
@cindex column view, in agenda
@cindex agenda, column view

Column view (@pxref{Column view}) is normally used to view and edit
properties embedded in the hierarchical structure of an Org file.  It can be
quite useful to use column view also from the agenda, where entries are
collected by certain criteria.

@table @kbd
@orgcmd{C-c C-x C-c,org-agenda-columns}
Turn on column view in the agenda.
@end table

To understand how to use this properly, it is important to realize that the
entries in the agenda are no longer in their proper outline environment.
This causes the following issues:

@enumerate
@item
@vindex org-columns-default-format
@vindex org-overriding-columns-format
Org needs to make a decision which @code{COLUMNS} format to use.  Since the
entries in the agenda are collected from different files, and different files
may have different @code{COLUMNS} formats, this is a non-trivial problem.
Org first checks if the variable @code{org-agenda-overriding-columns-format} is
currently set, and if so, takes the format from there.  Otherwise it takes
the format associated with the first item in the agenda, or, if that item
does not have a specific format (defined in a property, or in its file), it
uses @code{org-columns-default-format}.
@item
@cindex property, special, CLOCKSUM
If any of the columns has a summary type defined (@pxref{Column attributes}),
turning on column view in the agenda will visit all relevant agenda files and
make sure that the computations of this property are up to date.  This is
also true for the special @code{CLOCKSUM} property.  Org will then sum the
values displayed in the agenda.  In the daily/weekly agenda, the sums will
cover a single day; in all other views they cover the entire block.  It is
vital to realize that the agenda may show the same entry @emph{twice} (for
example as scheduled and as a deadline), and it may show two entries from the
same hierarchy (for example a @emph{parent} and its @emph{child}).  In these
cases, the summation in the agenda will lead to incorrect results because
some values will count double.
@item
When the column view in the agenda shows the @code{CLOCKSUM}, that is always
the entire clocked time for this item.  So even in the daily/weekly agenda,
the clocksum listed in column view may originate from times outside the
current view.  This has the advantage that you can compare these values with
a column listing the planned total effort for a task---one of the major
applications for column view in the agenda.  If you want information about
clocked time in the displayed period use clock table mode (press @kbd{R} in
the agenda).

@item
@cindex property, special, CLOCKSUM_T
When the column view in the agenda shows the @code{CLOCKSUM_T}, that is
always today's clocked time for this item.  So even in the weekly agenda,
the clocksum listed in column view only originates from today.  This lets
you compare the time you spent on a task for today, with the time already
spent (via @code{CLOCKSUM}) and with the planned total effort for it.
@end enumerate


@node Markup, Exporting, Agenda Views, Top
@chapter Markup for rich export

When exporting Org mode documents, the exporter tries to reflect the
structure of the document as accurately as possible in the back-end.  Since
export targets like HTML, @LaTeX{} allow much richer formatting, Org mode has
rules on how to prepare text for rich export.  This section summarizes the
markup rules used in an Org mode buffer.

The outline structure of the document as described in @ref{Document
Structure}, forms the basis for defining sections of the exported document.
However, since the outline structure is also used for (for example) lists of
tasks, only the first three outline levels will be used as headings.  Deeper
levels will become itemized lists.  You can change the location of this
switch globally by setting the variable @code{org-export-headline-levels}, or on a
per-file basis with a line

@cindex #+OPTIONS
@example
#+OPTIONS: H:4
@end example

@node Table of contents, Lists, Headings and sections, Structural markup elements
@subheading Table of contents
@cindex table of contents, markup rules

@cindex #+TOC
@vindex org-export-with-toc
The table of contents is normally inserted directly before the first headline
of the file.  The depth of the table is by default the same as the number of
headline levels, but you can choose a smaller number, or turn off the table
of contents entirely, by configuring the variable @code{org-export-with-toc},
or on a per-file basis with a line like

@example
#+OPTIONS: toc:2          (only to two levels in TOC)
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil        (no default TOC at all)
@end example

If you would like to move the table of contents to a different location, you
should turn off the default table using @code{org-export-with-toc} or
@code{#+OPTIONS} and insert @code{#+TOC: headlines N} at the desired
location(s).

@example
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil        (no default TOC)
...
#+TOC: headlines 2        (insert TOC here, with two headline levels)
@end example

Multiple @code{#+TOC: headline} lines are allowed.  The same @code{TOC}
keyword can also generate a list of all tables (resp.@: all listings) with a
caption in the buffer.

@example
#+TOC: listings           (build a list of listings)
#+TOC: tables             (build a list of tables)
@end example

@cindex property, ALT_TITLE
The headline's title usually determines its corresponding entry in a table of
contents.  However, it is possible to specify an alternative title by
setting @code{ALT_TITLE} property accordingly.  It will then be used when
building the table.

@node Lists, Paragraphs, Table of contents, Structural markup elements

description lists.

@node Paragraphs, Footnote markup, Lists, Structural markup elements
@subheading Paragraphs, line breaks, and quoting
@cindex paragraphs, markup rules

Paragraphs are separated by at least one empty line.  If you need to enforce
a line break within a paragraph, use @samp{\\} at the end of a line.

To keep the line breaks in a region, but otherwise use normal formatting, you
can use this construct, which can also be used to format poetry.

@cindex #+BEGIN_VERSE
@example
#+BEGIN_VERSE
 Great clouds overhead
 Tiny black birds rise and fall
 Snow covers Emacs

     -- AlexSchroeder
#+END_VERSE
@end example

When quoting a passage from another document, it is customary to format this
as a paragraph that is indented on both the left and the right margin.  You
can include quotations in Org mode documents like this:

@cindex #+BEGIN_QUOTE
@example
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Everything should be made as simple as possible,
but not any simpler -- Albert Einstein
#+END_QUOTE
@end example

If you would like to center some text, do it like this:
@cindex #+BEGIN_CENTER
@example
#+BEGIN_CENTER
Everything should be made as simple as possible, \\
but not any simpler
#+END_CENTER
@end example


@node Footnote markup, Emphasis and monospace, Paragraphs, Structural markup elements

multiple footnotes side by side.

You can make words @b{*bold*}, @i{/italic/}, _underlined_, @code{=verbatim=}
and @code{~code~}, and, if you must, @samp{+strike-through+}.  Text
in the code and verbatim string is not processed for Org mode specific
syntax, it is exported verbatim.

To turn off fontification for marked up text, you can set
@code{org-fontify-emphasized-text} to @code{nil}.  To narrow down the list of
available markup syntax, you can customize @code{org-emphasis-alist}.  To fine
tune what characters are allowed before and after the markup characters, you
can tweak @code{org-emphasis-regexp-components}.  Beware that changing one of
the above variables will no take effect until you reload Org, for which you
may need to restart Emacs.

@node Images and tables, Literal examples, Structural markup elements, Markup
@section Images and Tables

@cindex tables, markup rules
@cindex #+CAPTION
@cindex #+NAME
Both the native Org mode tables (@pxref{Tables}) and tables formatted with
the @file{table.el} package will be exported properly.  For Org mode tables,
the lines before the first horizontal separator line will become table header
lines.  You can use the following lines somewhere before the table to assign
a caption and a label for cross references, and in the text you can refer to
the object with @code{[[tab:basic-data]]} (@pxref{Internal links}):

@example
#+CAPTION: This is the caption for the next table (or link)
#+NAME:   tab:basic-data
   | ... | ...|
   |-----|----|
@end example

Optionally, the caption can take the form:
@example
#+CAPTION[Caption for list of tables]: Caption for table.
@end example

@cindex inlined images, markup rules
Some back-ends allow you to directly include images into the exported
document.  Org does this, if a link to an image files does not have
a description part, for example @code{[[./img/a.jpg]]}.  If you wish to
define a caption for the image and maybe a label for internal cross
references, make sure that the link is on a line by itself and precede it
with @code{#+CAPTION} and @code{#+NAME} as follows:

@example
#+CAPTION: This is the caption for the next figure link (or table)
#+NAME:   fig:SED-HR4049
[[./img/a.jpg]]
@end example

@noindent
Such images can be displayed within the buffer.  @xref{Handling links,the
discussion of image links}.

Even though images and tables are prominent examples of captioned structures,
the same caption mechanism can apply to many others (e.g., @LaTeX{}
equations, source code blocks).  Depending on the export back-end, those may
or may not be handled.

@node Literal examples, Include files, Images and tables, Markup
@section Literal examples
@cindex literal examples, markup rules
@cindex code line references, markup rules

You can include literal examples that should not be subjected to
markup.  Such examples will be typeset in monospace, so this is well suited
for source code and similar examples.
@cindex #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE

@example
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Some example from a text file.
#+END_EXAMPLE
@end example

Note that such blocks may be @i{indented} in order to align nicely with
indented text and in particular with plain list structure (@pxref{Plain
lists}).  For simplicity when using small examples, you can also start the
example lines with a colon followed by a space.  There may also be additional
whitespace before the colon:

@example
Here is an example
   : Some example from a text file.
@end example

@cindex formatting source code, markup rules
If the example is source code from a programming language, or any other text
that can be marked up by font-lock in Emacs, you can ask for the example to
look like the fontified Emacs buffer@footnote{This works automatically for
the HTML back-end (it requires version 1.34 of the @file{htmlize.el} package,
which is distributed with Org).  Fontified code chunks in @LaTeX{} can be
achieved using either the listings or the
@url{http://code.google.com/p/minted, minted,} package.  Refer to
@code{org-latex-listings} documentation for details.}.  This is done
with the @samp{src} block, where you also need to specify the name of the
major mode that should be used to fontify the example@footnote{Code in
@samp{src} blocks may also be evaluated either interactively or on export.
See @pxref{Working With Source Code} for more information on evaluating code
blocks.}, see @ref{Easy Templates} for shortcuts to easily insert code
blocks.
@cindex #+BEGIN_SRC

@example
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun org-xor (a b)
     "Exclusive or."
     (if a (not b) b))
#+END_SRC
@end example

Both in @code{example} and in @code{src} snippets, you can add a @code{-n}
switch to the end of the @code{BEGIN} line, to get the lines of the example
numbered.  If you use a @code{+n} switch, the numbering from the previous
numbered snippet will be continued in the current one.  In literal examples,
Org will interpret strings like @samp{(ref:name)} as labels, and use them as
targets for special hyperlinks like @code{[[(name)]]} (i.e., the reference name
enclosed in single parenthesis).  In HTML, hovering the mouse over such a
link will remote-highlight the corresponding code line, which is kind of
cool.

You can also add a @code{-r} switch which @i{removes} the labels from the
source code@footnote{Adding @code{-k} to @code{-n -r} will @i{keep} the
labels in the source code while using line numbers for the links, which might
be useful to explain those in an Org mode example code.}.  With the @code{-n}
switch, links to these references will be labeled by the line numbers from
the code listing, otherwise links will use the labels with no parentheses.
Here is an example:

@example
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp -n -r
(save-excursion                  (ref:sc)
   (goto-char (point-min)))      (ref:jump)
#+END_SRC
In line [[(sc)]] we remember the current position.  [[(jump)][Line (jump)]]
jumps to point-min.
@end example

@vindex org-coderef-label-format
If the syntax for the label format conflicts with the language syntax, use a
@code{-l} switch to change the format, for example @samp{#+BEGIN_SRC pascal
-n -r -l "((%s))"}.  See also the variable @code{org-coderef-label-format}.

HTML export also allows examples to be published as text areas (@pxref{Text
areas in HTML export}).

Because the @code{#+BEGIN_...} and @code{#+END_...} patterns need to be added
so often, shortcuts are provided using the Easy Templates facility
(@pxref{Easy Templates}).

@table @kbd
@kindex C-c '
@item C-c '
Edit the source code example at point in its native mode.  This works by
switching to a temporary buffer with the source code.  You need to exit by
pressing @kbd{C-c '} again@footnote{Upon exit, lines starting with @samp{*},
@samp{,*}, @samp{#+} and @samp{,#+} will get a comma prepended, to keep them
from being interpreted by Org as outline nodes or special syntax.  These
commas will be stripped for editing with @kbd{C-c '}, and also for export.}.
The edited version will then replace the old version in the Org buffer.
Fixed-width regions (where each line starts with a colon followed by a space)
will be edited using @code{artist-mode}@footnote{You may select
a different-mode with the variable @code{org-edit-fixed-width-region-mode}.}
to allow creating ASCII drawings easily.  Using this command in an empty line
will create a new fixed-width region.
@kindex C-c l
@item C-c l
Calling @code{org-store-link} while editing a source code example in a
temporary buffer created with @kbd{C-c '} will prompt for a label.  Make sure
that it is unique in the current buffer, and insert it with the proper
formatting like @samp{(ref:label)} at the end of the current line.  Then the
label is stored as a link @samp{(label)}, for retrieval with @kbd{C-c C-l}.
@end table


@node Include files, Index entries, Literal examples, Markup
@section Include files
@cindex include files, markup rules

During export, you can include the content of another file.  For example, to
include your @file{.emacs} file, you could use:
@cindex #+INCLUDE

@example
#+INCLUDE: "~/.emacs" src emacs-lisp
@end example

@noindent
The optional second and third parameter are the markup (i.e., @samp{example}
or @samp{src}), and, if the markup is @samp{src}, the language for formatting
the contents.  The markup is optional; if it is not given, the text will be
assumed to be in Org mode format and will be processed normally.

Contents of the included file will belong to the same structure (headline,
item) containing the @code{INCLUDE} keyword.  In particular, headlines within
the file will become children of the current section.  That behavior can be
changed by providing an additional keyword parameter, @code{:minlevel}.  In
that case, all headlines in the included file will be shifted so the one with
the lowest level reaches that specified level.  For example, to make a file
become a sibling of the current top-level headline, use

@example
#+INCLUDE: "~/my-book/chapter2.org" :minlevel 1
@end example

You can also include a portion of a file by specifying a lines range using
the @code{:lines} parameter.  The line at the upper end of the range will not
be included.  The start and/or the end of the range may be omitted to use the
obvious defaults.

@example
#+INCLUDE: "~/.emacs" :lines "5-10"   @r{Include lines 5 to 10, 10 excluded}
#+INCLUDE: "~/.emacs" :lines "-10"    @r{Include lines 1 to 10, 10 excluded}
#+INCLUDE: "~/.emacs" :lines "10-"    @r{Include lines from 10 to EOF}

You can specify entries that will be used for generating an index during

@end example

@noindent which can be referenced in
paragraphs, verse blocks, table cells and some keywords with
@code{@{@{@{name(arg1,arg2)@}@}@}}@footnote{Since commas separate arguments,
commas within arguments have to be escaped with a backslash character.
Conversely, backslash characters before a comma, and only them, need to be
escaped with another backslash character.}.  In addition to defined macros,
@code{@{@{@{title@}@}@}}, @code{@{@{@{author@}@}@}}, etc., will reference
information set by the @code{#+TITLE:}, @code{#+AUTHOR:}, and similar lines.
Also, @code{@{@{@{time(@var{FORMAT})@}@}@}} and
@code{@{@{@{modification-time(@var{FORMAT})@}@}@}} refer to current date time
and to the modification time of the file being exported, respectively.
@var{FORMAT} should be a format string understood by
@code{format-time-string}.

Macro expansion takes place during export.

Plain ASCII is normally sufficient for almost all note taking.  Exceptions
include scientific notes, which often require mathematical symbols and the
occasional formula.  @LaTeX{}@footnote{@LaTeX{} is a macro system based on
Donald E. Knuth's @TeX{} system.  Many of the features described here as
``@LaTeX{}'' are really from @TeX{}, but for simplicity I am blurring this
distinction.}  is widely used to typeset scientific documents.  Org mode
supports embedding @LaTeX{} code into its files, because many academics are
used to writing and reading @LaTeX{} source code, and because it can be
readily processed to produce pretty output for a number of export back-ends.

@cindex HTML entities
@cindex @LaTeX{} entities

You can use @LaTeX{}-like syntax to insert special symbols like @samp{\alpha}
to indicate the Greek letter, or @samp{\to} to indicate an arrow.  Completion
for these symbols is available, just type @samp{\} and maybe a few letters,
and press @kbd{M-@key{TAB}} to see possible completions.  Unlike @LaTeX{}
code, Org mode allows these symbols to be present without surrounding math
delimiters, for example:

@example
Angles are written as Greek letters \alpha, \beta and \gamma.
@end example

@vindex org-entities
During export, these symbols will be transformed into the native format of
the exporter back-end.  Strings like @code{\alpha} will be exported as
@code{&alpha;} in the HTML output, and as @code{$\alpha$} in the @LaTeX{}
output.  Similarly, @code{\nbsp} will become @code{&nbsp;} in HTML and
@code{~} in @LaTeX{}.  If you need such a symbol inside a word, terminate it
like this: @samp{\Aacute@{@}stor}.

A large number of entities is provided, with names taken from both HTML and
@LaTeX{}; see the variable @code{org-entities} for the complete list.
@samp{\-} is treated as a shy hyphen, and @samp{--}, @samp{---}, and
@samp{...} are all converted into special commands creating hyphens of
different lengths or a compact set of dots.

If you would like to see entities displayed as UTF-8 characters, use the
following command@footnote{You can turn this on by default by setting the
variable @code{org-pretty-entities}, or on a per-file base with the
@code{#+STARTUP} option @code{entitiespretty}.}:

@table @kbd
@cindex @code{entitiespretty}, STARTUP keyword
@kindex C-c C-x \

Just like in @LaTeX{}, @samp{^} and @samp{_} are used to indicate super- and
subscripts.  Again, these can be used without embedding them in math-mode
delimiters.  To increase the readability of ASCII text, it is not necessary
(but OK) to surround multi-character sub- and superscripts with curly braces.
For example

@example
The mass of the sun is M_sun = 1.989 x 10^30 kg.  The radius of
the sun is R_@{sun@} = 6.96 x 10^8 m.
@end example

@vindex org-use-sub-superscripts
If you write a text where the underscore is often used in a different
context, Org's convention to always interpret these as subscripts can get in
your way.  Configure the variable @code{org-use-sub-superscripts} to change
this convention.  For example, when setting this variable to @code{@{@}},
@samp{a_b} will not be interpreted as a subscript, but @samp{a_@{b@}} will.

@vindex org-format-latex-header
Going beyond symbols and sub- and superscripts, a full formula language is
needed.  Org mode can contain @LaTeX{} math fragments, and it supports ways
to process these for several export back-ends.  When exporting to @LaTeX{},
the code is obviously left as it is.  When exporting to HTML, Org invokes the
@uref{http://www.mathjax.org, MathJax library} (@pxref{Math formatting in
HTML export}) to process and display the math@footnote{If you plan to use
this regularly or on pages with significant page views, you should install
@file{MathJax} on your own server in order to limit the load of our server.}.
Finally, it can also process the mathematical expressions into
images@footnote{For this to work you need to be on a system with a working
@LaTeX{} installation.  You also need the @file{dvipng} program or the
@file{convert}, respectively available at
@url{http://sourceforge.net/projects/dvipng/} and from the @file{imagemagick}
suite.  The @LaTeX{} header that will be used when processing a fragment can
be configured with the variable @code{org-format-latex-header}.} that can be
displayed in a browser.

@LaTeX{} fragments don't need any special marking at all.  The following
snippets will be identified as @LaTeX{} source code:
@itemize @bullet
@item
Environments of any kind@footnote{When @file{MathJax} is used, only the
environments recognized by @file{MathJax} will be processed.  When
@file{dvipng} program or @file{imagemagick} suite is used to create images,
any @LaTeX{} environment will be handled.}.  The only requirement is that the
@code{\begin} and @code{\end} statements appear on a new line, at the
beginning of the line or after whitespaces only.
@item
Text within the usual @LaTeX{} math delimiters.  To avoid conflicts with
currency specifications, single @samp{$} characters are only recognized as
math delimiters if the enclosed text contains at most two line breaks, is
directly attached to the @samp{$} characters with no whitespace in between,
and if the closing @samp{$} is followed by whitespace, punctuation or a dash.
For the other delimiters, there is no such restriction, so when in doubt, use
@samp{\(...\)} as inline math delimiters.
@end itemize

@noindent For example:

@example
\begin@{equation@}
x=\sqrt@{b@}
\end@{equation@}

If $a^2=b$ and \( b=2 \), then the solution must be
either $$ a=+\sqrt@{2@} $$ or \[ a=-\sqrt@{2@} \].

CD@LaTeX{} mode is a minor mode that is normally used in combination with a
major @LaTeX{} mode like AUC@TeX{} in order to speed-up insertion of
environments and math templates.  Inside Org mode, you can make use of
some of the features of CD@LaTeX{} mode.  You need to install
@file{cdlatex.el} and @file{texmathp.el} (the latter comes also with
AUC@TeX{}) from @url{http://www.astro.uva.nl/~dominik/Tools/cdlatex}.
Don't use CD@LaTeX{} mode itself under Org mode, but use the light
version @code{org-cdlatex-mode} that comes as part of Org mode.  Turn it
on for the current buffer with @kbd{M-x org-cdlatex-mode RET}, or for all
Org files with

@lisp
(add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'turn-on-org-cdlatex)
@end lisp

When this mode is enabled, the following features are present (for more
details see the documentation of CD@LaTeX{} mode):
@itemize @bullet
@kindex C-c @{
@item
Environment templates can be inserted with @kbd{C-c @{}.
@item
@kindex @key{TAB}
The @key{TAB} key will do template expansion if the cursor is inside a
@LaTeX{} fragment@footnote{Org mode has a method to test if the cursor is
inside such a fragment, see the documentation of the function
@code{org-inside-LaTeX-fragment-p}.}.  For example, @key{TAB} will
expand @code{fr} to @code{\frac@{@}@{@}} and position the cursor
correctly inside the first brace.  Another @key{TAB} will get you into
the second brace.  Even outside fragments, @key{TAB} will expand
environment abbreviations at the beginning of a line.  For example, if
you write @samp{equ} at the beginning of a line and press @key{TAB},
this abbreviation will be expanded to an @code{equation} environment.
To get a list of all abbreviations, type @kbd{M-x cdlatex-command-help RET}.

@vindex cdlatex-simplify-sub-super-scripts
Pressing @kbd{_} and @kbd{^} inside a @LaTeX{} fragment will insert these
characters together with a pair of braces.  If you use @key{TAB} to move
out of the braces, and if the braces surround only a single character or
macro, they are removed again (depending on the variable
@code{cdlatex-simplify-sub-super-scripts}).
@item
@kindex `
Pressing the grave accent @kbd{`} followed by a character inserts math
macros, also outside @LaTeX{} fragments.  If you wait more than 1.5 seconds
after the grave accent, a help window will pop up.
@item
@kindex '
Pressing the apostrophe @kbd{'} followed by another character modifies
the symbol before point with an accent or a font.  If you wait more than
1.5 seconds after the apostrophe, a help window will pop up.  Character
modification will work only inside @LaTeX{} fragments; outside the quote
is normal.

@node Special blocks,  , Embedded @LaTeX{}, Markup
@section Special blocks
@cindex Special blocks

Org syntax includes pre-defined blocks (@pxref{Paragraphs} and @ref{Literal
examples}).  It is also possible to create blocks containing raw code
targeted at a specific back-ends (e.g., @samp{#+BEGIN_LATEX}).

Any other block is a @emph{special block}.

For example, @samp{#+BEGIN_ABSTRACT} and @samp{#+BEGIN_VIDEO} are special
blocks.  The first one is useful when exporting to @LaTeX{}, the second one
when exporting to HTML5.

Each export back-end decides if they should be exported, and how.  When the
block is ignored, its contents are still exported, as if the opening and
closing block lines were not there.  For example, when exporting a
@samp{#+BEGIN_TEST} block, HTML back-end wraps its contents within a
@samp{<div name="test">} tag.

Refer to back-end specific documentation for more information.

@node Exporting, Publishing, Markup, Top
@chapter Exporting
@cindex exporting

The Org mode export facilities can be used to export Org documents or parts
of Org documents to a variety of other formats.  In addition, these
facilities can be used with @code{orgtbl-mode} and/or @code{orgstruct-mode}
in foreign buffers so you can author tables and lists in Org syntax and
convert them in place to the target language.

ASCII export produces a readable and simple version of an Org file for
printing and sharing notes.  HTML export allows you to easily publish notes
on the web, or to build full-fledged websites.  @LaTeX{} export lets you use
Org mode and its structured editing functions to create arbitrarily complex
@LaTeX{} files for any kind of document.  OpenDocument Text (ODT) export
allows seamless collaboration across organizational boundaries.  Markdown
export lets you seamlessly collaborate with other developers.  Finally, iCal
export can extract entries with deadlines or appointments to produce a file
in the iCalendar format.

@section The Export Dispatcher
@vindex org-export-dispatch-use-expert-ui
@cindex Export, dispatcher

The main entry point for export related tasks is the dispatcher, a
hierarchical menu from which it is possible to select an export format and
toggle export options@footnote{It is also possible to use a less intrusive
interface by setting @code{org-export-dispatch-use-expert-ui} to a
non-@code{nil} value.  In that case, only a prompt is visible from the
minibuffer.  From there one can still switch back to regular menu by pressing
@key{?}.} from which it is possible to select an export format and to toggle
export options.

@c @quotation
@table @asis
@orgcmd{C-c C-e,org-export-dispatch}

Dispatch for export and publishing commands.  When called with a @kbd{C-u}
prefix argument, repeat the last export command on the current buffer while
preserving toggled options.  If the current buffer hasn't changed and subtree
export was activated, the command will affect that same subtree.
@end table
@c @end quotation

Normally the entire buffer is exported, but if there is an active region
only that part of the buffer will be exported.

Several export options (@pxref{Export settings}) can be toggled from the
export dispatcher with the following key combinations:

@table @kbd
@item C-a
@vindex org-export-async-init-file
Toggle asynchronous export.  Asynchronous export uses an external Emacs
process that is configured with a specified initialization file.

While exporting asynchronously, the output is not displayed, but stored in
a place called ``the export stack''.  This stack can be displayed by calling
the dispatcher with a double @kbd{C-u} prefix argument, or with @kbd{&} key
from the dispatcher menu.

@vindex org-export-in-background
To make this behavior the default, customize the variable
@code{org-export-in-background}.

@item C-b
Toggle body-only export.  Its effect depends on the back-end used.
Typically, if the back-end has a header section (like @code{<head>...</head>}
in the HTML back-end), a body-only export will not include this header.

@item C-s
@vindex org-export-initial-scope
Toggle subtree export.  The top heading becomes the document title.

You can change the default state of this option by setting
@code{org-export-initial-scope}.

@item C-v
Toggle visible-only export.  Only export the text that is currently
visible, i.e., not hidden by outline visibility in the buffer.

@end table

@vindex org-export-copy-to-kill-ring
With the exception of asynchronous export, a successful export process writes
its output to the kill-ring. You can configure this behavior by altering the
option @code{org-export-copy-to-kill-ring}.

@node Export back-ends, Export settings, The Export Dispatcher, Exporting
@section Export back-ends
@cindex Export, back-ends

An export back-end is a library that translates Org syntax into a foreign
format.  An export format is not available until the proper back-end has been
loaded.

@vindex org-export-backends
By default, the following four back-ends are loaded: @code{ascii},
@code{html}, @code{icalendar} and @code{latex}.  It is possible to add more
(or remove some) by customizing @code{org-export-backends}.

Built-in back-ends include:

@itemize
@item ascii (ASCII format)
@item beamer (@LaTeX{} Beamer format)
@item html (HTML format)
@item icalendar (iCalendar format)
@item latex (@LaTeX{} format)
@item man (Man page format)
@item md (Markdown format)
@item odt (OpenDocument Text format)
@item org (Org format)
@item texinfo (Texinfo format)
@end itemize

Other back-ends might be found in the @code{contrib/} directory
(@pxref{Installation}).

@node Export settings, ASCII/Latin-1/UTF-8 export, Export back-ends, Exporting
@section Export settings
@cindex Export, settings

Export options can be set: globally with variables; for an individual file by
making variables buffer-local with in-buffer settings (@pxref{In-buffer
settings}), by setting individual keywords, or by specifying them in a
compact form with the @code{#+OPTIONS} keyword; or for a tree by setting
properties (@pxref{Properties and Columns}).  Options set at a specific level
override options set at a more general level.

@cindex #+SETUPFILE
In-buffer settings may appear anywhere in the file, either directly or
indirectly through a file included using @samp{#+SETUPFILE: filename} syntax.
Option keyword sets tailored to a particular back-end can be inserted from
the export dispatcher (@pxref{The Export Dispatcher}) using the @code{Insert
template} command by pressing @key{#}.  To insert keywords individually,
a good way to make sure the keyword is correct is to type @code{#+} and then
to use @kbd{M-<TAB>} for completion.

The export keywords available for every back-end, and their equivalent global
variables, include:

@table @samp
@item AUTHOR
@vindex user-full-name
The document author (@code{user-full-name}).

@item CREATOR
@vindex org-export-creator-string
Entity responsible for output generation (@code{org-export-creator-string}).

@item DATE
@vindex org-export-date-timestamp-format
A date or a time-stamp@footnote{The variable
@code{org-export-date-timestamp-format} defines how this time-stamp will be
exported.}.

@item DESCRIPTION
The document description.  Back-ends handle it as they see fit (e.g., for the
XHTML meta tag), if at all.  You can use several such keywords for long
descriptions.

@item EMAIL
@vindex user-mail-address
The email address (@code{user-mail-address}).

@item KEYWORDS
The keywords defining the contents of the document.  Back-ends handle it as
they see fit (e.g., for the XHTML meta tag), if at all.  You can use several
such keywords if the list is long.

@item LANGUAGE
@vindex org-export-default-language
The language used for translating some strings
(@code{org-export-default-language}).  E.g., @samp{#+LANGUAGE: fr} will tell
Org to translate @emph{File} (english) into @emph{Fichier} (french) in the
clocktable.

@item SELECT_TAGS
@vindex org-export-select-tags
The tags that select a tree for export (@code{org-export-select-tags}).  The
default value is @code{:export:}.  Within a subtree tagged with
@code{:export:}, you can still exclude entries with @code{:noexport:} (see
below).  When headlines are selectively exported with @code{:export:}
anywhere in a file, text before the first headline is ignored.

@item EXCLUDE_TAGS
The tags that exclude a tree from export (@code{org-export-exclude-tags}).
The default value is @code{:noexport:}.  Entries with the @code{:noexport:}
tag will be unconditionally excluded from the export, even if they have an
@code{:export:} tag.

@item TITLE
The title to be shown (otherwise derived from buffer's name).  You can use
several such keywords for long titles.
@end table

The @code{#+OPTIONS} keyword is a compact@footnote{If you want to configure
many options this way, you can use several @code{#+OPTIONS} lines.} form that
recognizes the following arguments:

@table @code
@item ':
@vindex org-export-with-smart-quotes
Toggle smart quotes (@code{org-export-with-smart-quotes}).

@item *:
Toggle emphasized text (@code{org-export-with-emphasize}).

(@code{org-export-with-fixed-width}).

@item <:
@vindex org-export-with-timestamps
Toggle inclusion of any time/date active/inactive stamps
(@code{org-export-with-timestamps}).

@item :
@vindex org-export-preserve-breaks
Toggle line-break-preservation (@code{org-export-preserve-breaks}).

@item ^:
@vindex org-export-with-sub-superscripts
Toggle @TeX{}-like syntax for sub- and superscripts.  If you write "^:@{@}",
@samp{a_@{b@}} will be interpreted, but the simple @samp{a_b} will be left as
it is (@code{org-export-with-sub-superscripts}).

@item arch:
@vindex org-export-with-archived-trees
Configure export of archived trees.  Can be set to @code{headline} to only
process the headline, skipping its contents
(@code{org-export-with-archived-trees}).

@item author:
@vindex org-export-with-author
Toggle inclusion of author name into exported file
(@code{org-export-with-author}).

@item c:
@vindex org-export-with-clocks
Toggle inclusion of CLOCK keywords (@code{org-export-with-clocks}).

@item creator:
@vindex org-export-with-creator
Configure inclusion of creator info into exported file.  It may be set to
@code{comment} (@code{org-export-with-creator}).

@item d:
@vindex org-export-with-drawers
Toggle inclusion of drawers, or list drawers to include
(@code{org-export-with-drawers}).

@item e:
@vindex org-export-with-entities
Toggle inclusion of entities (@code{org-export-with-entities}).

@item email:

Toggle inclusion of the author's e-mail into exported file
(@code{org-export-with-email}).

@item f:
@vindex org-export-with-footnotes
Toggle the inclusion of footnotes (@code{org-export-with-footnotes}).

@item H:
@vindex org-export-headline-levels
Set the number of headline levels for export
(@code{org-export-headline-levels}).  Below that level, headlines are treated
differently.  In most back-ends, they become list items.

@item inline:
@vindex org-export-with-inlinetasks
Toggle inclusion of inlinetasks (@code{org-export-with-inlinetasks}).

@item num:
@vindex org-export-with-section-numbers
Toggle section-numbers (@code{org-export-with-section-numbers}).  It can also
be set to a number @samp{n}, so only headlines at that level or above will be
numbered.

@item p:
@vindex org-export-with-planning
Toggle export of planning information (@code{org-export-with-planning}).
``Planning information'' is the line containing the @code{SCHEDULED:}, the
@code{DEADLINE:} or the @code{CLOSED:} cookies or a combination of them.

@item pri:
@vindex org-export-with-priority
Toggle inclusion of priority cookies (@code{org-export-with-priority}).

Toggle inclusion of tasks (TODO items), can be @code{nil} to remove all
tasks, @code{todo} to remove DONE tasks, or a list of keywords to keep
(@code{org-export-with-tasks}).

@item tex:
@vindex org-export-with-latex

@code{verbatim} (@code{org-export-with-latex}).

@item timestamp:
@vindex org-export-time-stamp-file
Toggle inclusion of the creation time into exported file
(@code{org-export-time-stamp-file}).

@item toc:
@vindex org-export-with-toc
Toggle inclusion of the table of contents, or set the level limit
(@code{org-export-with-toc}).

@item todo:
@vindex org-export-with-todo-keywords
Toggle inclusion of TODO keywords into exported text
(@code{org-export-with-todo-keywords}).

@item |:
@vindex org-export-with-tables
Toggle inclusion of tables (@code{org-export-with-tables}).
@end table

When exporting only a subtree, each of the previous keywords@footnote{With
the exception of @samp{SETUPFILE}.} can be overridden locally by special node
properties.  These begin with @samp{EXPORT_}, followed by the name of the
keyword they supplant.  For example, @samp{DATE} and @samp{OPTIONS} keywords
become, respectively, @samp{EXPORT_DATE} and @samp{EXPORT_OPTIONS}
properties.

@cindex #+BIND
@vindex org-export-allow-bind-keywords
If @code{org-export-allow-bind-keywords} is non-@code{nil}, Emacs variables
can become buffer-local during export by using the BIND keyword.  Its syntax
is @samp{#+BIND: variable value}.  This is particularly useful for in-buffer
settings that cannot be changed using specific keywords.

@cindex property, EXPORT_FILE_NAME
The name of the output file to be generated is taken from the file associated
to the buffer, when possible, or asked to you otherwise.  For subtree export,
you can also set @samp{EXPORT_FILE_NAME} property.  In all cases, only the
base name of the file is retained, and a back-end specific extension is
added.

@node ASCII/Latin-1/UTF-8 export, Beamer export, Export settings, Exporting
@section ASCII/Latin-1/UTF-8 export
@cindex ASCII export
@cindex Latin-1 export
@cindex UTF-8 export

ASCII export produces a simple and very readable version of an Org mode
file, containing only plain ASCII@.  Latin-1 and UTF-8 export augment the file
with special characters and symbols available in these encodings.

@vindex org-ascii-links-to-notes
Links are exported in a footnote-like style, with the descriptive part in the
text and the link in a note before the next heading.  See the variable
@code{org-ascii-links-to-notes} for details and other options.

@subheading ASCII export commands

@table @kbd
@orgcmd{C-c C-e t a/l/u,org-ascii-export-to-ascii}
Export as an ASCII file.  For an Org file, @file{myfile.org}, the ASCII file
will be @file{myfile.txt}.  The file will be overwritten without warning.
When the original file is @file{myfile.txt}, the resulting file becomes
@file{myfile.txt.txt} in order to prevent data loss.
@orgcmd{C-c C-e t A/L/U,org-ascii-export-as-ascii}
Export to a temporary buffer.  Do not create a file.
@end table

@subheading Header and sectioning structure

In the exported version, the first three outline levels become headlines,
defining a general document structure.  Additional levels are exported as
lists.  The transition can also occur at a different level (@pxref{Export
settings}).

@subheading Quoting ASCII text

You can insert text that will only appear when using @code{ASCII} back-end
with the following constructs:

@cindex #+ASCII
@cindex #+BEGIN_ASCII
@example
Text @@@@ascii:and additional text@@@@ within a paragraph.

#+ASCII: Some text

#+BEGIN_ASCII
All lines in this block will appear only when using this back-end.
#+END_ASCII
@end example

@subheading ASCII specific attributes
@cindex #+ATTR_ASCII
@cindex horizontal rules, in ASCII export

@code{ASCII} back-end only understands one attribute, @code{:width}, which
specifies the length, in characters, of a given horizontal rule.  It must be
specified using an @code{ATTR_ASCII} line, directly preceding the rule.

@example
#+ATTR_ASCII: :width 10

support for turning an Org mode file or tree into a Beamer presentation.

@subheading Beamer export commands

@table @kbd
@orgcmd{C-c C-e l b,org-beamer-export-to-latex}
Export as a @LaTeX{} file.  For an Org file @file{myfile.org}, the @LaTeX{}
file will be @file{myfile.tex}.  The file will be overwritten without
warning.
@orgcmd{C-c C-e l B,org-beamer-export-as-latex}
Export to a temporary buffer.  Do not create a file.
@orgcmd{C-c C-e l P,org-beamer-export-to-pdf}
Export as @LaTeX{} and then process to PDF.
@item C-c C-e l O
Export as @LaTeX{} and then process to PDF, then open the resulting PDF file.
@end table

@subheading Sectioning, Frames and Blocks

Any tree with not-too-deep level nesting should in principle be exportable as
a Beamer presentation.  Headlines fall into three categories: sectioning
elements, frames and blocks.

@itemize @minus
@item
@vindex org-beamer-frame-level
Headlines become frames when their level is equal to
@code{org-beamer-frame-level} or @code{H} value in an @code{OPTIONS} line
(@pxref{Export settings}).

@cindex property, BEAMER_ENV
Though, if a headline in the current tree has a @code{BEAMER_ENV} property
set to either to @code{frame} or @code{fullframe}, its level overrides the
variable.  A @code{fullframe} is a frame with an empty (ignored) title.

@item
@vindex org-beamer-environments-default
@vindex org-beamer-environments-extra
All frame's children become @code{block} environments.  Special block types
can be enforced by setting headline's @code{BEAMER_ENV} property@footnote{If
this property is set, the entry will also get a @code{:B_environment:} tag to
make this visible.  This tag has no semantic meaning, it is only a visual
aid.} to an appropriate value (see @code{org-beamer-environments-default} for
supported values and @code{org-beamer-environments-extra} for adding more).

@item
@cindex property, BEAMER_REF
As a special case, if the @code{BEAMER_ENV} property is set to either
@code{appendix}, @code{note}, @code{noteNH} or @code{againframe}, the
headline will become, respectively, an appendix, a note (within frame or
between frame, depending on its level), a note with its title ignored or an
@code{\againframe} command.  In the latter case, a @code{BEAMER_REF} property
is mandatory in order to refer to the frame being resumed, and contents are
ignored.

Also, a headline with an @code{ignoreheading} environment will have its
contents only inserted in the output.  This special value is useful to have
data between frames, or to properly close a @code{column} environment.
@end itemize

@cindex property, BEAMER_ACT
@cindex property, BEAMER_OPT
Headlines also support @code{BEAMER_ACT} and @code{BEAMER_OPT} properties.
The former is translated as an overlay/action specification, or a default
overlay specification when enclosed within square brackets.  The latter
specifies options@footnote{The @code{fragile} option is added automatically
if it contains code that requires a verbatim environment, though.} for the
current frame or block.  The export back-end will automatically wrap
properties within angular or square brackets when appropriate.

@cindex property, BEAMER_COL
Moreover, headlines handle the @code{BEAMER_COL} property.  Its value should
be a decimal number representing the width of the column as a fraction of the
total text width.  If the headline has no specific environment, its title
will be ignored and its contents will fill the column created.  Otherwise,
the block will fill the whole column and the title will be preserved.  Two
contiguous headlines with a non-@code{nil} @code{BEAMER_COL} value share the same
@code{columns} @LaTeX{} environment.  It will end before the next headline
without such a property.  This environment is generated automatically.
Although, it can also be explicitly created, with a special @code{columns}
value for @code{BEAMER_ENV} property (if it needs to be set up with some
specific options, for example).

@subheading Beamer specific syntax

Beamer back-end is an extension of @LaTeX{} back-end.  As such, all @LaTeX{}
specific syntax (e.g., @samp{#+LATEX:} or @samp{#+ATTR_LATEX:}) is
recognized.  See @ref{@LaTeX{} and PDF export} for more information.

@cindex #+BEAMER_THEME
@cindex #+BEAMER_COLOR_THEME
@cindex #+BEAMER_FONT_THEME
@cindex #+BEAMER_INNER_THEME
@cindex #+BEAMER_OUTER_THEME
Beamer export introduces a number of keywords to insert code in the
document's header.  Four control appearance of the presentation:
@code{#+BEAMER_THEME}, @code{#+BEAMER_COLOR_THEME},
@code{#+BEAMER_FONT_THEME}, @code{#+BEAMER_INNER_THEME} and
@code{#+BEAMER_OUTER_THEME}.  All of them accept optional arguments
within square brackets.  The last one, @code{#+BEAMER_HEADER}, is more
generic and allows you to append any line of code in the header.

@example
#+BEAMER_THEME: Rochester [height=20pt]
#+BEAMER_COLOR_THEME: spruce
@end example

Table of contents generated from @code{toc:t} @code{OPTION} keyword are
wrapped within a @code{frame} environment.  Those generated from a @code{TOC}
keyword (@pxref{Table of contents}) are not.  In that case, it is also
possible to specify options, enclosed within square brackets.

@example
#+TOC: headlines [currentsection]
@end example

Beamer specific code can be inserted with the following constructs:

@cindex #+BEAMER
@cindex #+BEGIN_BEAMER
@example
#+BEAMER: \pause

#+BEGIN_BEAMER
All lines in this block will appear only when using this back-end.
#+END_BEAMER

Text @@@@beamer:some code@@@@ within a paragraph.
@end example

In particular, this last example can be used to add overlay specifications to
objects whose type is among @code{bold}, @code{item}, @code{link},
@code{radio-target} and @code{target}, when the value is enclosed within
angular brackets and put at the beginning the object.

@example
A *@@@@beamer:<2->@@@@useful* feature
@end example

@cindex #+ATTR_BEAMER
Eventually, every plain list has support for @code{:environment},
@code{:overlay} and @code{:options} attributes through
@code{ATTR_BEAMER} affiliated keyword.  The first one allows the use
of a different environment, the second sets overlay specifications and
the last one inserts optional arguments in current list environment.

@example
#+ATTR_BEAMER: :overlay +-
- item 1
- item 2
@end example

@subheading Editing support

You can turn on a special minor mode @code{org-beamer-mode} for faster
editing with:

@example
#+STARTUP: beamer
@end example

@table @kbd
@orgcmd{C-c C-b,org-beamer-select-environment}
In @code{org-beamer-mode}, this key offers fast selection of a Beamer
environment or the @code{BEAMER_COL} property.
@end table

Also, a template for useful in-buffer settings or properties can be inserted
into the buffer with @kbd{M-x org-beamer-insert-options-template}.  Among
other things, this will install a column view format which is very handy for
editing special properties used by Beamer.

the HTML file will be @file{myfile.html}.  The file will be overwritten
without warning.
@kbd{C-c C-e h o}

@c FIXME Exporting sublevels
@c @cindex headline levels, for exporting
@c In the exported version, the first 3 outline levels will become headlines,
@c defining a general document structure.  Additional levels will be exported as
@c itemized lists.  If you want that transition to occur at a different level,
@c specify it with a numeric prefix argument.  For example,

@c @example
@c @kbd{C-2 C-c C-e b}
@c @end example

@c @noindent
@c creates two levels of headings and does the rest as items.

@node HTML doctypes, HTML preamble and postamble, HTML Export commands, HTML export
@subsection HTML doctypes
@vindex org-html-doctype
@vindex org-html-doctype-alist

Org can export to various (X)HTML flavors.

Setting the variable @code{org-html-doctype} allows you to export to different
(X)HTML variants.  The exported HTML will be adjusted according to the syntax
requirements of that variant.  You can either set this variable to a doctype
string directly, in which case the exporter will try to adjust the syntax
automatically, or you can use a ready-made doctype.  The ready-made options
are:

@itemize
@item
``html4-strict''
@item
``html4-transitional''
@item
``html4-frameset''
@item
``xhtml-strict''
@item
``xhtml-transitional''
@item
``xhtml-frameset''
@item
``xhtml-11''
@item
``html5''
@item
``xhtml5''
@end itemize

See the variable @code{org-html-doctype-alist} for details.  The default is
``xhtml-strict''.

@subsubheading Fancy HTML5 export
@vindex org-html-html5-fancy
@vindex org-html-html5-elements

HTML5 introduces several new element types.  By default, Org will not make
use of these element types, but you can set @code{org-html-html5-fancy} to
@code{t} (or set @code{html5-fancy} item in an @code{OPTIONS} line), to
enable a few new block-level elements.  These are created using arbitrary
#+BEGIN and #+END blocks. For instance:

@example
#+BEGIN_ASIDE
Lorem ipsum
#+END_ASIDE
@end example

Will export to:

@example
<aside>
  <p>Lorem ipsum</p>
</aside>
@end example

While this:

@example
#+ATTR_HTML: :controls controls :width 350
#+BEGIN_VIDEO
#+HTML: <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
#+HTML: <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg">
Your browser does not support the video tag.
#+END_VIDEO
@end example

Becomes:

@example
<video controls="controls" width="350">
  <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg">
  <p>Your browser does not support the video tag.</p>
</video>
@end example

Special blocks that do not correspond to HTML5 elements (see
@code{org-html-html5-elements}) will revert to the usual behavior, i.e.,
@code{#+BEGIN_LEDERHOSEN} will still export to @samp{<div class="lederhosen">}.

Headlines cannot appear within special blocks.  To wrap a headline and its
contents in e.g., @samp{<section>} or @samp{<article>} tags, set the
@code{HTML_CONTAINER} property on the headline itself.

@node HTML preamble and postamble, Quoting HTML tags, HTML doctypes, HTML export
@subsection HTML preamble and postamble
@vindex org-html-preamble

@vindex org-html-preamble-format
@vindex org-html-postamble-format
@vindex org-html-validation-link
@vindex org-export-creator-string
@vindex org-export-time-stamp-file

The HTML exporter lets you define a preamble and a postamble.

The default value for @code{org-html-preamble} is @code{t}, which means
that the preamble is inserted depending on the relevant format string in
@code{org-html-preamble-format}.

Setting @code{org-html-preamble} to a string will override the default format
string.  If you set it to a function, it will insert the output of the
function, which must be a string.  Setting to @code{nil} will not insert any
preamble.

The default value for @code{org-html-postamble} is @code{'auto}, which means
that the HTML exporter will look for information about the author, the email,
the creator and the date, and build the postamble from these values.  Setting
@code{org-html-postamble} to @code{t} will insert the postamble from the
relevant format string found in @code{org-html-postamble-format}.  Setting it
to @code{nil} will not insert any postamble.

@node Quoting HTML tags, Links in HTML export, HTML preamble and postamble, HTML export
@subsection Quoting HTML tags

Plain @samp{<} and @samp{>} are always transformed to @samp{&lt;} and
@samp{&gt;} in HTML export.  If you want to include raw HTML code, which
should only appear in HTML export, mark it with @samp{@@@@html:} as in
@samp{@@@@html:<b>@@@@bold text@@@@html:</b>@@@@}.  For more extensive HTML
that should be copied verbatim to the exported file use either

@cindex #+HTML
@cindex #+BEGIN_HTML
@example
#+HTML: Literal HTML code for export
@end example

@noindent or
@cindex #+BEGIN_HTML

@example
#+BEGIN_HTML
All lines between these markers are exported literally
#+END_HTML
@end example


@node Links in HTML export, Tables in HTML export, Quoting HTML tags, HTML export
@subsection Links in HTML export

@cindex links, in HTML export
@cindex internal links, in HTML export
@cindex external links, in HTML export
Internal links (@pxref{Internal links}) will continue to work in HTML@.  This
includes automatic links created by radio targets (@pxref{Radio
targets}).  Links to external files will still work if the target file is on
the same @i{relative} path as the published Org file.  Links to other
@file{.org} files will be translated into HTML links under the assumption
that an HTML version also exists of the linked file, at the same relative
path.  @samp{id:} links can then be used to jump to specific entries across
files.  For information related to linking files while publishing them to a
publishing directory see @ref{Publishing links}.

If you want to specify attributes for links, you can do so using a special
@code{#+ATTR_HTML} line to define attributes that will be added to the
@code{<a>} or @code{<img>} tags.  Here is an example that sets @code{title}
and @code{style} attributes for a link:

@cindex #+ATTR_HTML
@example
#+ATTR_HTML: :title The Org mode homepage :style color:red;
[[http://orgmode.org]]
@end example

@node Tables in HTML export, Images in HTML export, Links in HTML export, HTML export
@subsection Tables
@cindex tables, in HTML
@vindex org-html-table-default-attributes

Org mode tables are exported to HTML using the table attributes defined in
@code{org-html-table-default-attributes}.  The default setting makes tables
without cell borders and frame.  If you would like to change this for
individual tables, place something like the following before the table:

@cindex #+CAPTION
@cindex #+ATTR_HTML
@example
#+CAPTION: This is a table with lines around and between cells
#+ATTR_HTML: :border 2 :rules all :frame border
@end example

@vindex org-html-table-row-tags
You can also modify the default tags used for each row by setting
@code{org-html-table-row-tags}.  See the docstring for an example on
how to use this option.

@node Images in HTML export, Math formatting in HTML export, Tables in HTML export, HTML export
@subsection Images in HTML export

@cindex images, inline in HTML
@cindex inlining images in HTML
@vindex org-html-inline-images
HTML export can inline images given as links in the Org file, and
it can make an image the clickable part of a link.  By
default@footnote{But see the variable
@code{org-html-inline-images}.}, images are inlined if a link does
not have a description.  So @samp{[[file:myimg.jpg]]} will be inlined,
while @samp{[[file:myimg.jpg][the image]]} will just produce a link
@samp{the image} that points to the image.  If the description part
itself is a @code{file:} link or a @code{http:} URL pointing to an
image, this image will be inlined and activated so that clicking on the
image will activate the link.  For example, to include a thumbnail that
will link to a high resolution version of the image, you could use:

@example
[[file:highres.jpg][file:thumb.jpg]]
@end example

If you need to add attributes to an inlined image, use a @code{#+ATTR_HTML}.
In the example below we specify the @code{alt} and @code{title} attributes to
support text viewers and accessibility, and align it to the right.

@cindex #+CAPTION
@cindex #+ATTR_HTML
@example
#+CAPTION: A black cat stalking a spider
#+ATTR_HTML: :alt cat/spider image :title Action! :align right
[[./img/a.jpg]]
@end example

@noindent
You could use @code{http} addresses just as well.

@node Math formatting in HTML export, Text areas in HTML export, Images in HTML export, HTML export
@subsection Math formatting in HTML export
@cindex MathJax
@cindex dvipng
@cindex imagemagick

@LaTeX{} math snippets (@pxref{@LaTeX{} fragments}) can be displayed in two
different ways on HTML pages.  The default is to use the
@uref{http://www.mathjax.org, MathJax system} which should work out of the
box with Org mode installation because @uref{http://orgmode.org} serves
@file{MathJax} for Org mode users for small applications and for testing
purposes.  @b{If you plan to use this regularly or on pages with significant
page views, you should install@footnote{Installation instructions can be
found on the MathJax website, see
@uref{http://www.mathjax.org/resources/docs/?installation.html}.} MathJax on
your own server in order to limit the load of our server.}  To configure
@file{MathJax}, use the variable @code{org-html-mathjax-options} or
insert something like the following into the buffer:

@example
#+HTML_MATHJAX: align:"left" mathml:t path:"/MathJax/MathJax.js"
@end example

@noindent See the docstring of the variable
@code{org-html-mathjax-options} for the meaning of the parameters in
this line.

If you prefer, you can also request that @LaTeX{} fragments are processed
into small images that will be inserted into the browser page.  Before the
availability of MathJax, this was the default method for Org files.  This
method requires that the @file{dvipng} program or @file{imagemagick} suite is
available on your system.  You can still get this processing with

@example
#+OPTIONS: tex:dvipng
@end example

or:

@example
#+OPTIONS: tex:imagemagick
@end example

@subsection Text areas in HTML export

@cindex text areas, in HTML
An alternative way to publish literal code examples in HTML is to use text
areas, where the example can even be edited before pasting it into an
application.  It is triggered by @code{:textarea} attribute at an
@code{example} or @code{src} block.

You may also use @code{:height} and @code{:width} attributes to specify the
height and width of the text area, which default to the number of lines in
the example, and 80, respectively.  For example

@example
#+ATTR_HTML: :textarea t :width 40
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (defun org-xor (a b)

TODO keywords and tags lead to conflicts, use the variables
@code{org-html-todo-kwd-class-prefix} and @code{org-html-tag-class-prefix} to

@code{org-html-style-default}, which you should not modify.  To turn
inclusion of these defaults off, customize
@code{org-html-head-include-default-style} or set @code{html-style} to
@code{nil} in an @code{OPTIONS} line.}.  You may overwrite these settings, or
add to them by using the variables @code{org-html-head} and
@code{org-html-head-extra}.  You can override the global values of these
variables for each file by using these keywords:

@cindex #+HTML_HEAD
@cindex #+HTML_HEAD_EXTRA
@example
#+HTML_HEAD: <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style1.css" />
#+HTML_HEAD_EXTRA: <link rel="alternate stylesheet" type="text/css" href="style2.css" />
@end example

@noindent
For longer style definitions, you can use several such lines.  You could also
directly write a @code{<style>} @code{</style>} section in this way, without
referring to an external file.

In order to add styles to a subtree, use the @code{:HTML_CONTAINER_CLASS:}
property to assign a class to the tree.  In order to specify CSS styles for a
particular headline, you can use the id specified in a @code{:CUSTOM_ID:}
property.

@subsection JavaScript supported display of web pages

@cindex Rose, Sebastian
Sebastian Rose has written a JavaScript program especially designed to
enhance the web viewing experience of HTML files created with Org.  This
program allows you to view large files in two different ways.  The first one
is an @emph{Info}-like mode where each section is displayed separately and
navigation can be done with the @kbd{n} and @kbd{p} keys (and some other keys
as well, press @kbd{?} for an overview of the available keys).  The second
view type is a @emph{folding} view much like Org provides inside Emacs.  The
script is available at @url{http://orgmode.org/org-info.js} and you can find
the documentation for it at @url{http://orgmode.org/worg/code/org-info-js/}.
We host the script at our site, but if you use it a lot, you might not want
to be dependent on @url{http://orgmode.org} and prefer to install a local
copy on your own web server.

All it then takes to use this program is adding a single line to the Org
file:

@cindex #+INFOJS_OPT
@example
#+INFOJS_OPT: view:info toc:nil
@end example

@noindent
If this line is found, the HTML header will automatically contain the code
needed to invoke the script.  Using the line above, you can set the following
viewing options:

@example
path:    @r{The path to the script.  The default is to grab the script from}
         @r{@url{http://orgmode.org/org-info.js}, but you might want to have}
         @r{a local copy and use a path like @samp{../scripts/org-info.js}.}
view:    @r{Initial view when the website is first shown.  Possible values are:}
         info      @r{Info-like interface with one section per page.}
         overview  @r{Folding interface, initially showing only top-level.}
         content   @r{Folding interface, starting with all headlines visible.}
         showall   @r{Folding interface, all headlines and text visible.}
sdepth:  @r{Maximum headline level that will still become an independent}
         @r{section for info and folding modes.  The default is taken from}
         @r{@code{org-export-headline-levels} (= the @code{H} switch in @code{#+OPTIONS}).}
         @r{If this is smaller than in @code{org-export-headline-levels}, each}
         @r{info/folding section can still contain child headlines.}
toc:     @r{Should the table of contents @emph{initially} be visible?}
         @r{Even when @code{nil}, you can always get to the "toc" with @kbd{i}.}
tdepth:  @r{The depth of the table of contents.  The defaults are taken from}
         @r{the variables @code{org-export-headline-levels} and @code{org-export-with-toc}.}
ftoc:    @r{Does the CSS of the page specify a fixed position for the "toc"?}
         @r{If yes, the toc will never be displayed as a section.}
ltoc:    @r{Should there be short contents (children) in each section?}
         @r{Make this @code{above} if the section should be above initial text.}
mouse:   @r{Headings are highlighted when the mouse is over them.  Should be}
         @r{@samp{underline} (default) or a background color like @samp{#cccccc}.}
buttons: @r{Should view-toggle buttons be everywhere?  When @code{nil} (the}
         @r{default), only one such button will be present.}
@end example
@noindent
@vindex org-html-infojs-options
@vindex org-html-use-infojs
You can choose default values for these options by customizing the variable
@code{org-html-infojs-options}.  If you always want to apply the script to your
pages, configure the variable @code{org-html-use-infojs}.

@LaTeX{} export can produce an arbitrarily complex LaTeX document of any
standard or custom document class.  With further processing@footnote{The
default @LaTeX{} output is designed for processing with @code{pdftex} or

alternative TeX engines, see the options
@code{org-latex-default-packages-alist} and @code{org-latex-packages-alist}.},
which the @LaTeX{} exporter is able to control, this back-end is able to
produce PDF output.  Because the @LaTeX{} exporter can be configured to use
the @code{hyperref} package, the default setup produces fully-linked PDF
output.

As in @LaTeX{}, blank lines are meaningful for this back-end: a paragraph
will not be started if two contiguous syntactical elements are not separated
by an empty line.

This back-end also offers enhanced support for footnotes.  Thus, it handles
nested footnotes, footnotes in tables and footnotes in a list item's
description.

Environment used for the table.  It can be set to any @LaTeX{} table
environment, like @code{tabularx}@footnote{Requires adding the
@code{tabularx} package to @code{org-latex-packages-alist}.},
@code{longtable}, @code{array}, @code{tabu}@footnote{Requires adding the
@code{tabu} package to @code{org-latex-packages-alist}.},
@code{bmatrix}@enddots{} It defaults to
@code{org-latex-default-table-environment} value.
@item :caption
@code{#+CAPTION} keyword is the simplest way to set a caption for a table
(@pxref{Images and tables}).  If you need more advanced commands for that
task, you can use @code{:caption} attribute instead.  Its value should be raw
@LaTeX{} code.  It has precedence over @code{#+CAPTION}.
@item :float
@itemx :placement
Float environment for the table.  Possible values are @code{sidewaystable},
@code{multicolumn}, @code{t} and @code{nil}.  When unspecified, a table with
a caption will have a @code{table} environment.  Moreover, @code{:placement}
attribute can specify the positioning of the float.
@item :align
@itemx :font
@itemx :width
Set, respectively, the alignment string of the table, its font size and its
width.  They only apply on regular tables.
@item :spread
Boolean specific to the @code{tabu} and @code{longtabu} environments, and
only takes effect when used in conjunction with the @code{:width} attribute.
When @code{:spread} is non-@code{nil}, the table will be spread or shrunk by the
value of @code{:width}.
@item :booktabs
@itemx :center
@itemx :rmlines
@vindex org-latex-tables-booktabs
@vindex org-latex-tables-centered
They toggle, respectively, @code{booktabs} usage (assuming the package is
properly loaded), table centering and removal of every horizontal rule but
the first one (in a "table.el" table only).  In particular,
@code{org-latex-tables-booktabs} (respectively @code{org-latex-tables-centered})
activates the first (respectively second) attribute globally.
@item :math-prefix
@itemx :math-suffix
@itemx :math-arguments
A string that will be inserted, respectively, before the table within the
math environment, after the table within the math environment, and between
the macro name and the contents of the table.  The @code{:math-arguments}
attribute is used for matrix macros that require more than one argument
(e.g., @code{qbordermatrix}).
@end table

Thus, attributes can be used in a wide array of situations, like writing
a table that will span over multiple pages, or a matrix product:

@example
#+ATTR_LATEX: :environment longtable :align l|lp@{3cm@}r|l
| ..... | ..... |
| ..... | ..... |

#+ATTR_LATEX: :mode math :environment bmatrix :math-suffix \times
| a | b |
| c | d |
#+ATTR_LATEX: :mode math :environment bmatrix
| 1 | 2 |
| 3 | 4 |
@end example

In the example below, @LaTeX{} command
@code{\bicaption@{HeadingA@}@{HeadingB@}} will set the caption.

@example
#+ATTR_LATEX: :caption \bicaption@{HeadingA@}@{HeadingB@}
| ..... | ..... |
| ..... | ..... |
@end example


@subsubheading Images in @LaTeX{} export
@cindex images, inline in @LaTeX{}
@cindex inlining images in @LaTeX{}

Images that are linked to without a description part in the link, like
@samp{[[file:img.jpg]]} or @samp{[[./img.jpg]]} will be inserted into the PDF
output file resulting from @LaTeX{} processing.  Org will use an
@code{\includegraphics} macro to insert the image@footnote{In the case of
TikZ (@url{http://sourceforge.net/projects/pgf/}) images, it will become an
@code{\input} macro wrapped within a @code{tikzpicture} environment.}.

You can specify specify image width or height with, respectively,
@code{:width} and @code{:height} attributes.  It is also possible to add any
other option with the @code{:options} attribute, as shown in the following
example:

@example
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width 5cm :options angle=90
[[./img/sed-hr4049.pdf]]
@end example

If you need a specific command for the caption, use @code{:caption}
attribute.  It will override standard @code{#+CAPTION} value, if any.

@example
#+ATTR_LATEX: :caption \bicaption@{HeadingA@}@{HeadingB@}
[[./img/sed-hr4049.pdf]]
@end example

If you have specified a caption as described in @ref{Images and tables}, the
picture will be wrapped into a @code{figure} environment and thus become
a floating element.  You can also ask Org to export an image as a float
without specifying caption by setting the @code{:float} attribute.  You may
also set it to:
@itemize @minus
@item
@code{t}: if you want to use the standard @samp{figure} environment.  It is
used by default if you provide a caption to the image.
@item
@code{multicolumn}: if you wish to include an image which spans multiple
columns in a page.  This will export the image wrapped in a @code{figure*}
environment.
@item
@code{wrap}: if you would like to let text flow around the image.  It will
make the figure occupy the left half of the page.
@item
@code{nil}: if you need to avoid any floating environment, even when
a caption is provided.
@end itemize
@noindent
To modify the placement option of any floating environment, set the
@code{placement} attribute.

@example
#+ATTR_LATEX: :float wrap :width 0.38\textwidth :placement @{r@}@{0.4\textwidth@}
[[./img/hst.png]]
@end example

If the @code{:comment-include} attribute is set to a non-@code{nil} value,
the @LaTeX{} @code{\includegraphics} macro will be commented out.

@subsubheading Plain lists in @LaTeX{} export
@cindex plain lists, in @LaTeX{} export

Plain lists accept two optional attributes: @code{:environment} and
@code{:options}.  The first one allows the use of a non-standard environment
(e.g., @samp{inparaenum}).  The second one specifies additional arguments for
that environment.

@example
#+ATTR_LATEX: :environment compactitem :options [$\circ$]
- you need ``paralist'' package to reproduce this example.
@end example

@subsubheading Source blocks in @LaTeX{} export
@cindex source blocks, in @LaTeX{} export

In addition to syntax defined in @ref{Literal examples}, names and captions
(@pxref{Images and tables}), source blocks also accept a @code{:float}
attribute.  You may set it to:
@itemize @minus
@item
@code{t}: if you want to make the source block a float.  It is the default
value when a caption is provided.
@item
@code{multicolumn}: if you wish to include a source block which spans multiple
columns in a page.
@item
@code{nil}: if you need to avoid any floating environment, even when a caption
is provided.  It is useful for source code that may not fit in a single page.
@end itemize

@example
#+ATTR_LATEX: :float nil
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
Code that may not fit in a single page.
#+END_SRC
@end example

@subsubheading Special blocks in @LaTeX{} export
@cindex special blocks, in @LaTeX{} export
@cindex abstract, in @LaTeX{} export
@cindex proof, in @LaTeX{} export

In @LaTeX{} back-end, special blocks become environments of the same name.
Value of @code{:options} attribute will be appended as-is to that
environment's opening string.  For example:

@example
#+BEGIN_ABSTRACT
We demonstrate how to solve the Syracuse problem.
#+END_ABSTRACT

#+ATTR_LATEX: :options [Proof of important theorem]
#+BEGIN_PROOF
...
Therefore, any even number greater than 2 is the sum of two primes.
#+END_PROOF
@end example

@noindent
becomes

@example
\begin@{abstract@}
We demonstrate how to solve the Syracuse problem.
\end@{abstract@}

\begin@{proof@}[Proof of important theorem]
...
Therefore, any even number greater than 2 is the sum of two primes.
\end@{proof@}
@end example

If you need to insert a specific caption command, use @code{:caption}
attribute.  It will override standard @code{#+CAPTION} value, if any.  For
example:

@example
#+ATTR_LATEX: :caption \MyCaption@{HeadingA@}
#+BEGIN_PROOF
...
#+END_PROOF
@end example

@subsubheading Horizontal rules
@cindex horizontal rules, in @LaTeX{} export

Width and thickness of a given horizontal rule can be controlled with,
respectively, @code{:width} and @code{:thickness} attributes:

@example
#+ATTR_LATEX: :width .6\textwidth :thickness 0.8pt
-----
@end example

@subheading Header and sectioning structure

@vindex org-md-headline-style
Markdown export can generate both @code{atx} and @code{setext} types for
headlines, according to @code{org-md-headline-style}.  The former introduces
a hard limit of two levels, whereas the latter pushes it to six.  Headlines
below that limit are exported as lists.  You can also set a soft limit before
that one (@pxref{Export settings}).

@node Extending ODT export, Applying custom styles, ODT export commands, OpenDocument Text export
@subsection Extending ODT export

The ODT exporter can interface with a variety of document
converters and supports popular converters out of the box.  As a result, you
can use it to export to formats like @samp{doc} or convert a document from
one format (say @samp{csv}) to another format (say @samp{ods} or @samp{xls}).

@cindex @file{unoconv}
@cindex LibreOffice
If you have a working installation of LibreOffice, a document converter is
pre-configured for you and you can use it right away.  If you would like to
use @file{unoconv} as your preferred converter, customize the variable
@code{org-odt-convert-process} to point to @code{unoconv}.  You can
also use your own favorite converter or tweak the default settings of the
@file{LibreOffice} and @samp{unoconv} converters.  @xref{Configuring a
document converter}.

@subsubsection Automatically exporting to other formats
@anchor{x-export-to-other-formats}

@vindex org-odt-preferred-output-format
Very often, you will find yourself exporting to ODT format, only to
immediately save the exported document to other formats like @samp{doc},
@samp{docx}, @samp{rtf}, @samp{pdf} etc.  In such cases, you can specify your
preferred output format by customizing the variable
@code{org-odt-preferred-output-format}.  This way, the export commands
(@pxref{x-export-to-odt,,Exporting to ODT}) can be extended to export to a
format that is of immediate interest to you.

@subsubsection Converting between document formats
@anchor{x-convert-to-other-formats}

There are many document converters in the wild which support conversion to
and from various file formats, including, but not limited to the
ODT format.  LibreOffice converter, mentioned above, is one such
converter.  Once a converter is configured, you can interact with it using
the following command.

@vindex org-odt-convert
@table @kbd

@item M-x org-odt-convert RET
Convert an existing document from one format to another.  With a prefix
argument, also open the newly produced file.
@end table

@node Applying custom styles, Links in ODT export, Extending ODT export, OpenDocument Text export
@subsection Applying custom styles
@cindex styles, custom
@cindex template, custom

The ODT exporter ships with a set of OpenDocument styles
(@pxref{Working with OpenDocument style files}) that ensure a well-formatted
output.  These factory styles, however, may not cater to your specific
tastes.  To customize the output, you can either modify the above styles
files directly, or generate the required styles using an application like
LibreOffice.  The latter method is suitable for expert and non-expert
users alike, and is described here.

@subsubsection Applying custom styles: the easy way

@enumerate
@item
Create a sample @file{example.org} file with the below settings and export it
to ODT format.

@example
#+OPTIONS: H:10 num:t
@end example

@item
Open the above @file{example.odt} using LibreOffice.  Use the @file{Stylist}
to locate the target styles---these typically have the @samp{Org} prefix---and
modify those to your taste.  Save the modified file either as an
OpenDocument Text (@file{.odt}) or OpenDocument Template (@file{.ott}) file.

@item
@cindex #+ODT_STYLES_FILE
@vindex org-odt-styles-file
Customize the variable @code{org-odt-styles-file} and point it to the
newly created file.  For additional configuration options
@pxref{x-overriding-factory-styles,,Overriding factory styles}.

If you would like to choose a style on a per-file basis, you can use the
@code{#+ODT_STYLES_FILE} option.  A typical setting will look like

@example
#+ODT_STYLES_FILE: "/path/to/example.ott"
@end example

or

@example
#+ODT_STYLES_FILE: ("/path/to/file.ott" ("styles.xml" "image/hdr.png"))
@end example

@end enumerate

@subsubsection Using third-party styles and templates

You can use third-party styles and templates for customizing your output.
This will produce the desired output only if the template provides all
style names that the @samp{ODT} exporter relies on.  Unless this condition is
met, the output is going to be less than satisfactory.  So it is highly
recommended that you only work with templates that are directly derived from
the factory settings.

@node Links in ODT export, Tables in ODT export, Applying custom styles, OpenDocument Text export
@subsection Links in ODT export
@cindex links, in ODT export

ODT exporter creates native cross-references for internal links.  It creates
Internet-style links for all other links.

A link with no description and destined to a regular (un-itemized) outline
heading is replaced with a cross-reference and section number of the heading.

A @samp{\ref@{label@}}-style reference to an image, table etc.@: is replaced
with a cross-reference and sequence number of the labeled entity.
@xref{Labels and captions in ODT export}.

@node Tables in ODT export, Images in ODT export, Links in ODT export, OpenDocument Text export
@subsection Tables in ODT export
@cindex tables, in ODT export

Export of native Org mode tables (@pxref{Tables}) and simple @file{table.el}
tables is supported.  However, export of complex @file{table.el} tables---tables
that have column or row spans---is not supported.  Such tables are
stripped from the exported document.

By default, a table is exported with top and bottom frames and with rules
separating row and column groups (@pxref{Column groups}).  Furthermore, all
tables are typeset to occupy the same width.  If the table specifies
alignment and relative width for its columns (@pxref{Column width and
alignment}) then these are honored on export.@footnote{The column widths are
interpreted as weighted ratios with the default weight being 1}

@cindex #+ATTR_ODT
You can control the width of the table by specifying @code{:rel-width}
property using an @code{#+ATTR_ODT} line.

For example, consider the following table which makes use of all the rules
mentioned above.

@example
#+ATTR_ODT: :rel-width 50
| Area/Month    |   Jan |   Feb |   Mar |   Sum |
|---------------+-------+-------+-------+-------|
| /             |     < |       |       |     < |
| <l13>         |  <r5> |  <r5> |  <r5> |  <r6> |
| North America |     1 |    21 |   926 |   948 |
| Middle East   |     6 |    75 |   844 |   925 |
| Asia Pacific  |     9 |    27 |   790 |   826 |
|---------------+-------+-------+-------+-------|
| Sum           |    16 |   123 |  2560 |  2699 |
@end example

On export, the table will occupy 50% of text area.  The columns will be sized
(roughly) in the ratio of 13:5:5:5:6.  The first column will be left-aligned
and rest of the columns will be right-aligned.  There will be vertical rules
after separating the header and last columns from other columns.  There will
be horizontal rules separating the header and last rows from other rows.

If you are not satisfied with the above formatting options, you can create
custom table styles and associate them with a table using the
@code{#+ATTR_ODT} line.  @xref{Customizing tables in ODT export}.

@subsubheading Embedding images
You can embed images within the exported document by providing a link to the
desired image file with no link description.  For example, to embed
@samp{img.png} do either of the following:

@example
[[file:img.png]]
@end example

@example
[[./img.png]]
@end example

@subsubheading Embedding clickable images
You can create clickable images by providing a link whose description is a
link to an image file.  For example, to embed a image
@file{org-mode-unicorn.png} which when clicked jumps to
@uref{http://Orgmode.org} website, do the following

@example
[[http://orgmode.org][./org-mode-unicorn.png]]
@end example

@subsubheading Sizing and scaling of embedded images

@cindex #+ATTR_ODT
You can control the size and scale of the embedded images using the
@code{#+ATTR_ODT} attribute.

@cindex identify, ImageMagick
@vindex org-odt-pixels-per-inch
The exporter specifies the desired size of the image in the final document in
units of centimeters.  In order to scale the embedded images, the exporter
queries for pixel dimensions of the images using one of a) ImageMagick's
@file{identify} program or b) Emacs @code{create-image} and @code{image-size}
APIs@footnote{Use of @file{ImageMagick} is only desirable.  However, if you
routinely produce documents that have large images or you export your Org
files that has images using a Emacs batch script, then the use of
@file{ImageMagick} is mandatory.}. The pixel dimensions are subsequently
converted in to units of centimeters using
@code{org-odt-pixels-per-inch}.  The default value of this variable is
set to @code{display-pixels-per-inch}.  You can tweak this variable to
achieve the best results.

The examples below illustrate the various possibilities.

@table @asis
@item Explicitly size the image
To embed @file{img.png} as a 10 cm x 10 cm image, do the following:

@example
#+ATTR_ODT: :width 10 :height 10
[[./img.png]]
@end example

@item Scale the image
To embed @file{img.png} at half its size, do the following:

@example
#+ATTR_ODT: :scale 0.5
[[./img.png]]
@end example

@item Scale the image to a specific width
To embed @file{img.png} with a width of 10 cm while retaining the original
height:width ratio, do the following:

@example
#+ATTR_ODT: :width 10
[[./img.png]]
@end example

@item Scale the image to a specific height
To embed @file{img.png} with a height of 10 cm while retaining the original
height:width ratio, do the following

@example
#+ATTR_ODT: :height 10
[[./img.png]]
@end example
@end table

@subsubheading Anchoring of images

@cindex #+ATTR_ODT
You can control the manner in which an image is anchored by setting the
@code{:anchor} property of it's @code{#+ATTR_ODT} line.  You can specify one
of the following three values for the @code{:anchor} property:
@samp{"as-char"}, @samp{"paragraph"} and @samp{"page"}.

To create an image that is anchored to a page, do the following:
@example
#+ATTR_ODT: :anchor "page"

@subsubsection Working with @LaTeX{} math snippets

@LaTeX{} math snippets (@pxref{@LaTeX{} fragments}) can be embedded in the ODT
document in one of the following ways:

@cindex MathML
@enumerate
@item MathML

This option is activated on a per-file basis with

@example
#+OPTIONS: LaTeX:t
@end example

With this option, @LaTeX{} fragments are first converted into MathML
fragments using an external @LaTeX{}-to-MathML converter program.  The
resulting MathML fragments are then embedded as an OpenDocument Formula in
the exported document.

@vindex org-latex-to-mathml-convert-command
@vindex org-latex-to-mathml-jar-file

You can specify the @LaTeX{}-to-MathML converter by customizing the variables
@code{org-latex-to-mathml-convert-command} and
@code{org-latex-to-mathml-jar-file}.

If you prefer to use @file{MathToWeb}@footnote{See
@uref{http://www.mathtoweb.com/cgi-bin/mathtoweb_home.pl, MathToWeb}} as your
converter, you can configure the above variables as shown below.

@lisp
(setq org-latex-to-mathml-convert-command
      "java -jar %j -unicode -force -df %o %I"
      org-latex-to-mathml-jar-file
      "/path/to/mathtoweb.jar")
@end lisp

You can use the following commands to quickly verify the reliability of
the @LaTeX{}-to-MathML converter.

@table @kbd
@item M-x org-odt-export-as-odf RET
Convert a @LaTeX{} math snippet to an OpenDocument formula (@file{.odf}) file.

@item M-x org-odt-export-as-odf-and-open RET
Convert a @LaTeX{} math snippet to an OpenDocument formula (@file{.odf}) file
and open the formula file with the system-registered application.
@end table

@item PNG images

This option is activated on a per-file basis with

@example
#+OPTIONS: tex:dvipng
@end example

or:

@example
#+OPTIONS: tex:imagemagick
@end example

With this option, @LaTeX{} fragments are processed into PNG images and the
resulting images are embedded in the exported document.  This method requires
that the @file{dvipng} program or @file{imagemagick} suite be available on
your system.

@code{#+CAPTION} lines.  @xref{Images and tables}.  ODT exporter enumerates
each labeled or captioned object of a given category separately.  As a
result, each such object is assigned a sequence number based on order of it's
appearance in the Org file.

In the exported document, a user-provided caption is augmented with the
category and sequence number.  Consider the following inline image in an Org
file.

@example
#+CAPTION: Bell curve
#+LABEL:   fig:SED-HR4049

You can modify the category component of the caption by customizing the
option @code{org-odt-category-map-alist}.  For example, to tag all embedded
images with the string @samp{Illustration} (instead of the default
@samp{Figure}) use the following setting:

@lisp
(setq org-odt-category-map-alist
      (("__Figure__" "Illustration" "value" "Figure" org-odt--enumerable-image-p)))
@end lisp

With this, previous image will be captioned as below in the exported
document.

@subsection Literal examples in ODT export

Export of literal examples (@pxref{Literal examples}) with full fontification
is supported.  Internally, the exporter relies on @file{htmlfontify.el} to
generate all style definitions needed for a fancy listing.@footnote{Your
@file{htmlfontify.el} library must at least be at Emacs 24.1 levels for
fontification to be turned on.}  The auto-generated styles have @samp{OrgSrc}
as prefix and inherit their color from the faces used by Emacs
@code{font-lock} library for the source language.

@vindex org-odt-fontify-srcblocks
If you prefer to use your own custom styles for fontification, you can do
so by customizing the option
@code{org-odt-create-custom-styles-for-srcblocks}.

@vindex org-odt-create-custom-styles-for-srcblocks
You can turn off fontification of literal examples by customizing the

@cindex converter

The ODT exporter can work with popular converters with little or no
extra configuration from your side. @xref{Extending ODT export}.
If you are using a converter that is not supported by default or if you would
like to tweak the default converter settings, proceed as below.

@enumerate
@item Register the converter

@vindex org-odt-convert-processes
Name your converter and add it to the list of known converters by
customizing the option @code{org-odt-convert-processes}.  Also specify how
the converter can be invoked via command-line to effect the conversion.

@item Configure its capabilities

@vindex org-odt-convert-capabilities
@anchor{x-odt-converter-capabilities} Specify the set of formats the
converter can handle by customizing the variable
@code{org-odt-convert-capabilities}.  Use the default value for this
variable as a guide for configuring your converter.  As suggested by the
default setting, you can specify the full set of formats supported by the
converter and not limit yourself to specifying formats that are related to
just the OpenDocument Text format.

@item Choose the converter

@vindex org-odt-convert-process
Select the newly added converter as the preferred one by customizing the
option @code{org-odt-convert-process}.

This section explores the internals of the ODT exporter and the
means by which it produces styled documents.  Read this section if you are
interested in exploring the automatic and custom OpenDocument styles used by
the exporter.

@anchor{x-factory-styles}
@subsubheading Factory styles

The ODT exporter relies on two files for generating its output.
These files are bundled with the distribution under the directory pointed to
by the variable @code{org-odt-styles-dir}.  The two files are:

@itemize
@anchor{x-orgodtstyles-xml}
@item
@file{OrgOdtStyles.xml}

This file contributes to the @file{styles.xml} file of the final @samp{ODT}
document.  This file gets modified for the following purposes:
@enumerate

@item
To control outline numbering based on user settings.

@item
To add styles generated by @file{htmlfontify.el} for fontification of code
blocks.
@end enumerate

@anchor{x-orgodtcontenttemplate-xml}
@item
@file{OrgOdtContentTemplate.xml}

This file contributes to the @file{content.xml} file of the final @samp{ODT}
document.  The contents of the Org outline are inserted between the
@samp{<office:text>}@dots{}@samp{</office:text>} elements of this file.

Apart from serving as a template file for the final @file{content.xml}, the
file serves the following purposes:
@enumerate

@item
It contains automatic styles for formatting of tables which are referenced by
the exporter.

@item
It contains @samp{<text:sequence-decl>}@dots{}@samp{</text:sequence-decl>}
elements that control how various entities---tables, images, equations,
etc.---are numbered.
@end enumerate
@end itemize

@anchor{x-overriding-factory-styles}
@subsubheading Overriding factory styles
The following two variables control the location from which the ODT
exporter picks up the custom styles and content template files.  You can
customize these variables to override the factory styles used by the
exporter.

@itemize
@anchor{x-org-odt-styles-file}
@item
@code{org-odt-styles-file}

Use this variable to specify the @file{styles.xml} that will be used in the
final output.  You can specify one of the following values:

@enumerate
@item A @file{styles.xml} file

Use this file instead of the default @file{styles.xml}

@item A @file{.odt} or @file{.ott} file

Use the @file{styles.xml} contained in the specified OpenDocument Text or
Template file

@item A @file{.odt} or @file{.ott} file and a subset of files contained within them

Use the @file{styles.xml} contained in the specified OpenDocument Text or
Template file.  Additionally extract the specified member files and embed
those within the final @samp{ODT} document.

Use this option if the @file{styles.xml} file references additional files
like header and footer images.

@item @code{nil}

Use the default @file{styles.xml}
@end enumerate

@anchor{x-org-odt-content-template-file}
@item
@code{org-odt-content-template-file}

Use this variable to specify the blank @file{content.xml} that will be used
in the final output.
@end itemize

@node Creating one-off styles, Customizing tables in ODT export, Working with OpenDocument style files, Advanced topics in ODT export
@subsubsection Creating one-off styles

There are times when you would want one-off formatting in the exported
document.  You can achieve this by embedding raw OpenDocument XML in the Org
file.  The use of this feature is better illustrated with couple of examples.

@enumerate
@item Embedding ODT tags as part of regular text

You can inline OpenDocument syntax by enclosing it within
@samp{@@@@odt:...@@@@} markup.  For example, to highlight a region of text do
the following:

@example
@@@@odt:<text:span text:style-name="Highlight">This is a highlighted
text</text:span>@@@@.  But this is a regular text.
@end example

@strong{Hint:} To see the above example in action, edit your
@file{styles.xml} (@pxref{x-orgodtstyles-xml,,Factory styles}) and add a
custom @samp{Highlight} style as shown below.

@example
<style:style style:name="Highlight" style:family="text">
  <style:text-properties fo:background-color="#ff0000"/>
</style:style>
@end example

@item Embedding a one-line OpenDocument XML

You can add a simple OpenDocument one-liner using the @code{#+ODT:}
directive.  For example, to force a page break do the following:

@example
#+ODT: <text:p text:style-name="PageBreak"/>
@end example

@strong{Hint:} To see the above example in action, edit your
@file{styles.xml} (@pxref{x-orgodtstyles-xml,,Factory styles}) and add a
custom @samp{PageBreak} style as shown below.

@example
<style:style style:name="PageBreak" style:family="paragraph"
             style:parent-style-name="Text_20_body">
  <style:paragraph-properties fo:break-before="page"/>
</style:style>
@end example

@item Embedding a block of OpenDocument XML

You can add a large block of OpenDocument XML using the
@code{#+BEGIN_ODT}@dots{}@code{#+END_ODT} construct.

For example, to create a one-off paragraph that uses bold text, do the
following:

@example
#+BEGIN_ODT
<text:p text:style-name="Text_20_body_20_bold">
This paragraph is specially formatted and uses bold text.
</text:p>
#+END_ODT
@end example

@end enumerate

@node Customizing tables in ODT export, Validating OpenDocument XML, Creating one-off styles, Advanced topics in ODT export
@subsubsection Customizing tables in ODT export
@cindex tables, in ODT export

@cindex #+ATTR_ODT
You can override the default formatting of the table by specifying a custom
table style with the @code{#+ATTR_ODT} line.  For a discussion on default
formatting of tables @pxref{Tables in ODT export}.

This feature closely mimics the way table templates are defined in the
OpenDocument-v1.2
specification.@footnote{@url{http://docs.oasis-open.org/office/v1.2/OpenDocument-v1.2.html,
OpenDocument-v1.2 Specification}}

@subsubheading Custom table styles: an illustration

@vindex org-odt-table-styles
To have a quick preview of this feature, install the below setting and
export the table that follows:

@lisp
(setq org-odt-table-styles
      (append org-odt-table-styles
            '(("TableWithHeaderRowAndColumn" "Custom"
                ((use-first-row-styles . t)
                 (use-first-column-styles . t)))
                ("TableWithFirstRowandLastRow" "Custom"
                 ((use-first-row-styles . t)
                 (use-last-row-styles . t))))))
@end lisp

@example
#+ATTR_ODT: :style "TableWithHeaderRowAndColumn"
| Name  | Phone | Age |
| Peter |  1234 |  17 |
| Anna  |  4321 |  25 |
@end example

In the above example, you used a template named @samp{Custom} and installed
two table styles with the names @samp{TableWithHeaderRowAndColumn} and
@samp{TableWithFirstRowandLastRow}.  (@strong{Important:} The OpenDocument
styles needed for producing the above template have been pre-defined for
you.  These styles are available under the section marked @samp{Custom
Table Template} in @file{OrgOdtContentTemplate.xml}
(@pxref{x-orgodtcontenttemplate-xml,,Factory styles}).  If you need
additional templates you have to define these styles yourselves.

@subsubheading Custom table styles: the nitty-gritty
To use this feature proceed as follows:

@enumerate
@item
Create a table template@footnote{See the @code{<table:table-template>}
element of the OpenDocument-v1.2 specification}

A table template is nothing but a set of @samp{table-cell} and
@samp{paragraph} styles for each of the following table cell categories:

@itemize @minus
@item Body
@item First column
@item Last column
@item First row
@item Last row
@item Even row
@item Odd row
@item Even column
@item Odd Column
@end itemize

The names for the above styles must be chosen based on the name of the table
template using a well-defined convention.

The naming convention is better illustrated with an example.  For a table
template with the name @samp{Custom}, the needed style names are listed in
the following table.

@multitable  {Table cell type} {CustomEvenColumnTableCell} {CustomEvenColumnTableParagraph}
@headitem Table cell type
@tab @code{table-cell} style
@tab @code{paragraph} style
@item
@tab
@tab
@item Body
@tab @samp{CustomTableCell}
@tab @samp{CustomTableParagraph}
@item First column
@tab @samp{CustomFirstColumnTableCell}
@tab @samp{CustomFirstColumnTableParagraph}
@item Last column
@tab @samp{CustomLastColumnTableCell}
@tab @samp{CustomLastColumnTableParagraph}
@item First row
@tab @samp{CustomFirstRowTableCell}
@tab @samp{CustomFirstRowTableParagraph}
@item Last row
@tab @samp{CustomLastRowTableCell}
@tab @samp{CustomLastRowTableParagraph}
@item Even row
@tab @samp{CustomEvenRowTableCell}
@tab @samp{CustomEvenRowTableParagraph}
@item Odd row
@tab @samp{CustomOddRowTableCell}
@tab @samp{CustomOddRowTableParagraph}
@item Even column
@tab @samp{CustomEvenColumnTableCell}
@tab @samp{CustomEvenColumnTableParagraph}
@item Odd column
@tab @samp{CustomOddColumnTableCell}
@tab @samp{CustomOddColumnTableParagraph}
@end multitable

To create a table template with the name @samp{Custom}, define the above
styles in the
@code{<office:automatic-styles>}...@code{</office:automatic-styles>} element
of the content template file (@pxref{x-orgodtcontenttemplate-xml,,Factory
styles}).

@item
Define a table style@footnote{See the attributes @code{table:template-name},
@code{table:use-first-row-styles}, @code{table:use-last-row-styles},
@code{table:use-first-column-styles}, @code{table:use-last-column-styles},
@code{table:use-banding-rows-styles}, and
@code{table:use-banding-column-styles} of the @code{<table:table>} element in
the OpenDocument-v1.2 specification}

@vindex org-odt-table-styles
To define a table style, create an entry for the style in the variable
@code{org-odt-table-styles} and specify the following:

@itemize @minus
@item the name of the table template created in step (1)
@item the set of cell styles in that template that are to be activated
@end itemize

For example, the entry below defines two different table styles
@samp{TableWithHeaderRowAndColumn} and @samp{TableWithFirstRowandLastRow}
based on the same template @samp{Custom}.  The styles achieve their intended
effect by selectively activating the individual cell styles in that template.

@lisp
(setq org-odt-table-styles
      (append org-odt-table-styles
              '(("TableWithHeaderRowAndColumn" "Custom"
                 ((use-first-row-styles . t)
                  (use-first-column-styles . t)))
                ("TableWithFirstRowandLastRow" "Custom"
                 ((use-first-row-styles . t)
                  (use-last-row-styles . t))))))
@end lisp

@item
Associate a table with the table style

To do this, specify the table style created in step (2) as part of
the @code{ATTR_ODT} line as shown below.

@example
#+ATTR_ODT: :style "TableWithHeaderRowAndColumn"
| Name  | Phone | Age |
| Peter |  1234 |  17 |
| Anna  |  4321 |  25 |
@end example
@end enumerate

@node Validating OpenDocument XML,  , Customizing tables in ODT export, Advanced topics in ODT export
@subsubsection Validating OpenDocument XML

Occasionally, you will discover that the document created by the
ODT exporter cannot be opened by your favorite application.  One of
the common reasons for this is that the @file{.odt} file is corrupt.  In such
cases, you may want to validate the document against the OpenDocument RELAX
NG Compact Syntax (RNC) schema.

For de-compressing the @file{.odt} file@footnote{@file{.odt} files are
nothing but @samp{zip} archives}: @inforef{File Archives,,emacs}.  For
general help with validation (and schema-sensitive editing) of XML files:
@inforef{Introduction,,nxml-mode}.

@vindex org-odt-schema-dir
If you have ready access to OpenDocument @file{.rnc} files and the needed
schema-locating rules in a single folder, you can customize the variable
@code{org-odt-schema-dir} to point to that directory.  The ODT exporter
will take care of updating the @code{rng-schema-locating-files} for you.

@subsection Document preamble

When processing a document, @samp{texinfo} back-end generates a minimal file
header along with a title page, a copyright page, and a menu.  You control
the latter through the structure of the document (@pxref{Headings and
sectioning structure}).  Various keywords allow to tweak the other parts.  It
is also possible to give directions to install the document in the @samp{Top}
node.

@subsubheading File header

@cindex #+TEXINFO_FILENAME
Upon creating the header of a Texinfo file, the back-end guesses a name for
the Info file to be compiled.  This may not be a sensible choice, e.g., if
you want to produce the final document in a different directory.  Specify an
alternate path with @code{#+TEXINFO_FILENAME} keyword to override the default
destination.

@vindex org-texinfo-coding-system
@vindex org-texinfo-classes
@cindex #+TEXINFO_HEADER
@cindex #+TEXINFO_CLASS
Along with the output file name, the header contains information about the
language (@pxref{Export settings}) and current encoding used@footnote{See
@code{org-texinfo-coding-system} for more information.}.  Insert
a @code{#+TEXINFO_HEADER} keyword for each additional command needed, e.g.,
@@code@{@@synindex@}.

If you happen to regularly install the same set of commands, it may be easier
to define your own class in @code{org-texinfo-classes}, which see.  Set
@code{#+TEXINFO_CLASS} keyword accordingly in your document to activate it.

@subsubheading Title and copyright page

@cindex #+TEXINFO_PRINTED_TITLE
@cindex #+SUBTITLE
The default template includes a title page for hard copy output.  The title
and author displayed on this page are extracted from, respectively,
@code{#+TITLE} and @code{#+AUTHOR} keywords (@pxref{Export settings}).  It is
also possible to print a different, more specific, title with
@code{#+TEXINFO_PRINTED_TITLE} keyword, and add subtitles with
@code{#+SUBTITLE} keyword.  Both expect raw Texinfo code in their value.

@cindex #+SUBAUTHOR
Likewise, information brought by @code{#+AUTHOR} may not be enough.  You can
include other authors with several @code{#+SUBAUTHOR} keywords.  Values are
also expected to be written in Texinfo code.

@example
#+AUTHOR: Jane Smith
#+SUBAUTHOR: John Doe
#+TEXINFO_PRINTED_TITLE: This Long Title@@inlinefmt@{tex,@@*@} Is Broken in @@TeX@{@}
@end example

@cindex property, COPYING
Copying material is defined in a dedicated headline with a non-nil
@code{:COPYING:} property.  The contents are inserted within
a @code{@@copying} command at the beginning of the document whereas the
heading itself does not appear in the structure of the document.

Copyright information is printed on the back of the title page.

@example
* Copying
  :PROPERTIES:
  :COPYING: t

@cindex #+TEXINFO_DIR_CATEGORY
@cindex #+TEXINFO_DIR_TITLE

You may ultimately want to install your new Info file to your system.  You
can write an appropriate entry in the top level directory specifying its
category and title with, respectively, @code{#+TEXINFO_DIR_CATEGORY} and
@code{#+TEXINFO_DIR_TITLE}.  Optionally, you can add a short description
using @code{#+TEXINFO_DIR_DESC}.  The following example would write an entry
similar to Org's in the @samp{Top} node.

@example
#+TEXINFO_DIR_CATEGORY: Emacs
#+TEXINFO_DIR_TITLE: Org Mode: (org)
#+TEXINFO_DIR_DESC: Outline-based notes management and organizer
@end example

@node Headings and sectioning structure, Indices, Document preamble, Texinfo export
@subsection Headings and sectioning structure

@vindex org-texinfo-classes
@vindex org-texinfo-default-class
@cindex #+TEXINFO_CLASS
@samp{texinfo} uses a pre-defined scheme, or class, to convert headlines into
Texinfo structuring commands.  For example, a top level headline appears as
@code{@@chapter} if it should be numbered or as @code{@@unnumbered}
otherwise.  If you need to use a different set of commands, e.g., to start
with @code{@@part} instead of @code{@@chapter}, install a new class in
@code{org-texinfo-classes}, then activate it with @code{#+TEXINFO_CLASS}
keyword.  Export process defaults to @code{org-texinfo-default-class} when
there is no such keyword in the document.

If a headline's level has no associated structuring command, or is below
a certain threshold @pxref{Export settings}, that headline becomes a list in
Texinfo output.

@cindex property, APPENDIX
As an exception, a headline with a non-nil @code{:APPENDIX:} property becomes
an appendix, independently on its level and the class used.

@cindex property, DESCRIPTION
Each regular sectioning structure creates a menu entry, named after the
heading.  You can provide a different, e.g., shorter, title in
@code{:ALT_TITLE:} property (@pxref{Table of contents}).  Optionally, you can
specify a description for the item in @code{:DESCRIPTION:} property.  E.g.,

@example

provides one for each predefined type: @code{#+CINDEX}, @code{#+FINDEX},
@code{#+KINDEX}, @code{#+PINDEX}, @code{#+TINDEX} and @code{#+VINDEX}.  For
custom indices, you can write raw Texinfo code (@pxref{Quoting Texinfo

@example
#+CINDEX: Defining indexing entries
@end example

@cindex property, INDEX
To generate an index, you need to set the @code{:INDEX:} property of
a headline to an appropriate abbreviation (e.g., @samp{cp} or @samp{vr}).
The headline is then exported as an unnumbered chapter or section command and
the index is inserted after its contents.

@cindex #+ATTR_TEXINFO
@samp{texinfo} back-end understands several attributes in plain lists and
tables.  They must be specified using an @code{#+ATTR_TEXINFO} keyword,
written just above the list or table.

@subsubheading Plain lists

In Texinfo output, description lists appear as two-column tables, using the
default command @code{@@table}.  You can use @code{@@ftable} or
@code{@@vtable}@footnote{For more information, @inforef{Two-column
Tables,,texinfo}.} instead with @code{:table-type} attribute.

@vindex org-texinfo-def-table-markup
In any case, these constructs require a highlighting command for entries in
the list.  You can provide one with @code{:indic} attribute.  If you do not,
it defaults to the value stored in @code{org-texinfo-def-table-markup}, which

@example
#+ATTR_TEXINFO: :indic @@asis

@node iCalendar export, Other built-in back-ends, Texinfo export, Exporting
@section iCalendar export
@cindex iCalendar export

@vindex org-icalendar-include-todo
@vindex org-icalendar-use-deadline
@vindex org-icalendar-use-scheduled
@vindex org-icalendar-categories
@vindex org-icalendar-alarm-time
Some people use Org mode for keeping track of projects, but still prefer a
standard calendar application for anniversaries and appointments.  In this
case it can be useful to show deadlines and other time-stamped items in Org
files in the calendar application.  Org mode can export calendar information
in the standard iCalendar format.  If you also want to have TODO entries
included in the export, configure the variable
@code{org-icalendar-include-todo}.  Plain timestamps are exported as VEVENT,
and TODO items as VTODO@.  It will also create events from deadlines that are
in non-TODO items.  Deadlines and scheduling dates in TODO items will be used
to set the start and due dates for the TODO entry@footnote{See the variables
@code{org-icalendar-use-deadline} and @code{org-icalendar-use-scheduled}.}.
As categories, it will use the tags locally defined in the heading, and the
file/tree category@footnote{To add inherited tags or the TODO state,
configure the variable @code{org-icalendar-categories}.}.  See the variable
@code{org-icalendar-alarm-time} for a way to assign alarms to entries with a
time.

@vindex org-icalendar-store-UID
@cindex property, ID
The iCalendar standard requires each entry to have a globally unique
identifier (UID).  Org creates these identifiers during export.  If you set
the variable @code{org-icalendar-store-UID}, the UID will be stored in the
@code{:ID:} property of the entry and re-used next time you report this
entry.  Since a single entry can give rise to multiple iCalendar entries (as
a timestamp, a deadline, a scheduled item, and as a TODO item), Org adds
prefixes to the UID, depending on what triggered the inclusion of the entry.
In this way the UID remains unique, but a synchronization program can still
figure out from which entry all the different instances originate.

@table @kbd
@orgcmd{C-c C-e c f,org-icalendar-export-to-ics}
Create iCalendar entries for the current buffer and store them in the same
directory, using a file extension @file{.ics}.
@orgcmd{C-c C-e c a, org-icalendar-export-agenda-files}
@vindex org-agenda-files
Like @kbd{C-c C-e c f}, but do this for all files in
@code{org-agenda-files}.  For each of these files, a separate iCalendar
file will be written.
@orgcmd{C-c C-e c c,org-icalendar-combine-agenda-files}
@vindex org-icalendar-combined-agenda-file
Create a single large iCalendar file from all files in
@code{org-agenda-files} and write it to the file given by
@code{org-icalendar-combined-agenda-file}.
@end table

@vindex org-use-property-inheritance
@vindex org-icalendar-include-body
@cindex property, SUMMARY
@cindex property, DESCRIPTION
@cindex property, LOCATION
The export will honor SUMMARY, DESCRIPTION and LOCATION@footnote{The LOCATION
property can be inherited from higher in the hierarchy if you configure
@code{org-use-property-inheritance} accordingly.} properties if the selected
entries have them.  If not, the summary will be derived from the headline,
and the description from the body (limited to
@code{org-icalendar-include-body} characters).

How this calendar is best read and updated, depends on the application
you are using.  The FAQ covers this issue.

@node Other built-in back-ends, Export in foreign buffers, iCalendar export, Exporting
@section Other built-in back-ends
@cindex export back-ends, built-in
@vindex org-export-backends

On top of the aforementioned back-ends, Org comes with other built-in ones:

@itemize
@item @file{ox-man.el}: export to a man page.
@end itemize

To activate these export back-end, customize @code{org-export-backends} or
load them directly with e.g., @code{(require 'ox-man)}.  This will add new
keys in the export dispatcher (@pxref{The Export Dispatcher}).

See the comment section of these files for more information on how to use
them.

@node Export in foreign buffers, Advanced configuration, Other built-in back-ends, Exporting
@section Export in foreign buffers

Most built-in back-ends come with a command to convert the selected region
into a selected format and replace this region by the exported output.  Here
is a list of such conversion commands:

@table @code
@item org-html-convert-region-to-html
Convert the selected region into HTML.
@item org-latex-convert-region-to-latex
Convert the selected region into @LaTeX{}.
@item org-texinfo-convert-region-to-texinfo
Convert the selected region into @code{Texinfo}.
@item org-md-convert-region-to-md
Convert the selected region into @code{MarkDown}.
@end table

This is particularly useful for converting tables and lists in foreign
buffers.  E.g., in an HTML buffer, you can turn on @code{orgstruct-mode}, then
use Org commands for editing a list, and finally select and convert the list
with @code{M-x org-html-convert-region-to-html RET}.

@node Advanced configuration,  , Export in foreign buffers, Exporting
@section Advanced configuration

@subheading Hooks

@vindex org-export-before-processing-hook
@vindex org-export-before-parsing-hook
Two hooks are run during the first steps of the export process.  The first
one, @code{org-export-before-processing-hook} is called before expanding
macros, Babel code and include keywords in the buffer.  The second one,
@code{org-export-before-parsing-hook}, as its name suggests, happens just
before parsing the buffer.  Their main use is for heavy duties, that is
duties involving structural modifications of the document.  For example, one
may want to remove every headline in the buffer during export.  The following
code can achieve this:

@lisp
@group
(defun my-headline-removal (backend)
  "Remove all headlines in the current buffer.
BACKEND is the export back-end being used, as a symbol."
  (org-map-entries
   (lambda () (delete-region (point) (progn (forward-line) (point))))))

(add-hook 'org-export-before-parsing-hook 'my-headline-removal)
@end group
@end lisp

Note that functions used in these hooks require a mandatory argument,
a symbol representing the back-end used.

@subheading Filters

@cindex Filters, exporting
Filters are lists of functions applied on a specific part of the output from
a given back-end.  More explicitly, each time a back-end transforms an Org
object or element into another language, all functions within a given filter
type are called in turn on the string produced.  The string returned by the
last function will be the one used in the final output.

There are filters sets for each type of element or object, for plain text,
for the parse tree, for the export options and for the final output.  They
are all named after the same scheme: @code{org-export-filter-TYPE-functions},
where @code{TYPE} is the type targeted by the filter.  Valid types are:

@multitable @columnfractions .33 .33 .33
@item bold
@tab babel-call
@tab center-block
@item clock
@tab code
@tab comment
@item comment-block
@tab diary-sexp

@item dynamic-block

@tab example-block

@tab footnote-definition
@tab footnote-reference
@item headline
@tab horizontal-rule
@tab inline-babel-call
@item inline-src-block
@tab inlinetask
@tab italic
@item item
@tab keyword
@tab latex-environment
@item latex-fragment
@tab line-break
@tab link
@item node-property
@tab options
@tab paragraph
@item parse-tree
@tab plain-list
@tab plain-text
@item planning
@tab property-drawer
@tab quote-block
@item quote-section
@tab radio-target
@tab section
@item special-block
@tab src-block
@tab statistics-cookie
@item strike-through
@tab subscript
@tab superscript
@item table
@tab table-cell
@tab table-row
@item target
@tab timestamp
@tab underline
@item verbatim
@tab verse-block
@tab
@end multitable

For example, the following snippet allows me to use non-breaking spaces in
the Org buffer and get them translated into @LaTeX{} without using the
@code{\nbsp} macro (where @code{_} stands for the non-breaking space):

@lisp
@group
(defun my-latex-filter-nobreaks (text backend info)
  "Ensure \"_\" are properly handled in LaTeX export."
  (when (org-export-derived-backend-p backend 'latex)
        (replace-regexp-in-string "_" "~" text)))

(add-to-list 'org-export-filter-plain-text-functions
             'my-latex-filter-nobreaks)
@end group
@end lisp

Three arguments must be provided to a filter: the code being changed, the
back-end used, and some information about the export process.  You can safely
ignore the third argument for most purposes.  Note the use of
@code{org-export-derived-backend-p}, which ensures that the filter will only
be applied when using @code{latex} back-end or any other back-end derived
from it (e.g., @code{beamer}).

@subheading Extending an existing back-end

This is obviously the most powerful customization, since the changes happen
at the parser level.  Indeed, some export back-ends are built as extensions
of other ones (e.g., Markdown back-end an extension of HTML back-end).

Extending a back-end means that if an element type is not transcoded by the
new back-end, it will be handled by the original one.  Hence you can extend
specific parts of a back-end without too much work.

As an example, imagine we want the @code{ascii} back-end to display the
language used in a source block, when it is available, but only when some
attribute is non-@code{nil}, like the following:

@example
#+ATTR_ASCII: :language t
@end example

Because that back-end is lacking in that area, we are going to create a new
back-end, @code{my-ascii} that will do the job.

@lisp
@group
(defun my-ascii-src-block (src-block contents info)
  "Transcode a SRC-BLOCK element from Org to ASCII.
CONTENTS is nil.  INFO is a plist used as a communication
channel."
  (if (not (org-export-read-attribute :attr_ascii src-block :language))
    (org-export-with-backend 'ascii src-block contents info)
  (concat
   (format ",--[ %s ]--\n%s`----"
           (org-element-property :language src-block)
           (replace-regexp-in-string
            "^" "| "
            (org-element-normalize-string
             (org-export-format-code-default src-block info)))))))

(org-export-define-derived-backend 'my-ascii 'ascii
  :translate-alist '((src-block . my-ascii-src-block)))
@end group
@end lisp

The @code{my-ascii-src-block} function looks at the attribute above the
element.  If it isn't true, it gives hand to the @code{ascii} back-end.
Otherwise, it creates a box around the code, leaving room for the language.
A new back-end is then created.  It only changes its behavior when
translating @code{src-block} type element.  Now, all it takes to use the new
back-end is calling the following from an Org buffer:

@smalllisp
(org-export-to-buffer 'my-ascii "*Org MY-ASCII Export*")
@end smalllisp

It is obviously possible to write an interactive function for this, install
it in the export dispatcher menu, and so on.

@node Publishing, Working With Source Code, Exporting, Top
@chapter Publishing
@cindex publishing

Org includes a publishing management system that allows you to configure
automatic HTML conversion of @emph{projects} composed of interlinked org
files.  You can also configure Org to automatically upload your exported HTML
pages and related attachments, such as images and source code files, to a web
server.

You can also use Org to convert files into PDF, or even combine HTML and PDF
conversion so that files are available in both formats on the server.

Publishing has been contributed to Org by David O'Toole.

@subsection The variable @code{org-publish-project-alist}
@cindex org-publish-project-alist
@cindex projects, for publishing

@vindex org-publish-project-alist
Publishing is configured almost entirely through setting the value of one
variable, called @code{org-publish-project-alist}.  Each element of the list
configures one project, and may be in one of the two following forms:

@lisp
   ("project-name" :property value :property value ...)
     @r{i.e., a well-formed property list with alternating keys and values}
@r{or}
   ("project-name" :components ("project-name" "project-name" ...))

@end lisp

In both cases, projects are configured by specifying property values.  A
project defines the set of files that will be published, as well as the
publishing configuration to use when publishing those files.  When a project
takes the second form listed above, the individual members of the
@code{:components} property are taken to be sub-projects, which group
together files requiring different publishing options.  When you publish such
a ``meta-project'', all the components will also be published, in the
sequence given.

@node Sources and destinations, Selecting files, Project alist, Configuration
@subsection Sources and destinations for files
@cindex directories, for publishing

Most properties are optional, but some should always be set.  In
particular, Org needs to know where to look for source files,
and where to put published files.

@multitable @columnfractions 0.3 0.7
@item @code{:base-directory}
@tab Directory containing publishing source files
@item @code{:publishing-directory}
@tab Directory where output files will be published.  You can directly
publish to a web server using a file name syntax appropriate for
the Emacs @file{tramp} package.  Or you can publish to a local directory and
use external tools to upload your website (@pxref{Uploading files}).
@item @code{:preparation-function}
@tab Function or list of functions to be called before starting the
publishing process, for example, to run @code{make} for updating files to be
published.  The project property list is scoped into this call as the
variable @code{project-plist}.
@item @code{:completion-function}
@tab Function or list of functions called after finishing the publishing
process, for example, to change permissions of the resulting files.  The
project property list is scoped into this call as the variable
@code{project-plist}.
@end multitable
@noindent

@node Selecting files, Publishing action, Sources and destinations, Configuration
@subsection Selecting files
@cindex files, selecting for publishing

By default, all files with extension @file{.org} in the base directory
are considered part of the project.  This can be modified by setting the
properties
@multitable @columnfractions 0.25 0.75
@item @code{:base-extension}
@tab Extension (without the dot!) of source files.  This actually is a
regular expression.  Set this to the symbol @code{any} if you want to get all
files in @code{:base-directory}, even without extension.

@item @code{:exclude}
@tab Regular expression to match file names that should not be
published, even though they have been selected on the basis of their
extension.

@item @code{:include}
@tab List of files to be included regardless of @code{:base-extension}
and @code{:exclude}.

@item @code{:recursive}
@tab non-@code{nil} means, check base-directory recursively for files to publish.
@end multitable

@node Publishing action, Publishing options, Selecting files, Configuration
@subsection Publishing action
@cindex action, for publishing

Publishing means that a file is copied to the destination directory and
possibly transformed in the process.  The default transformation is to export
Org files as HTML files, and this is done by the function
@code{org-html-publish-to-html}, which calls the HTML exporter (@pxref{HTML
export}).  But you also can publish your content as PDF files using
@code{org-latex-publish-to-pdf} or as @code{ascii}, @code{Texinfo}, etc.,
using the corresponding functions.

If you want to publish the Org file as an @code{.org} file but with the
@i{archived}, @i{commented} and @i{tag-excluded} trees removed, use the
function @code{org-org-publish-to-org}.  This will produce @file{file.org}
and put it in the publishing directory.  If you want a htmlized version of
this file, set the parameter @code{:htmlized-source} to @code{t}, it will
produce @file{file.org.html} in the publishing directory@footnote{If the
publishing directory is the same than the source directory, @file{file.org}
will be exported as @file{file.org.org}, so probably don't want to do this.}.

Other files like images only need to be copied to the publishing destination.
For this you can use @code{org-publish-attachment}.  For non-org files, you
always need to specify the publishing function:

@multitable @columnfractions 0.3 0.7
@item @code{:publishing-function}
@tab Function executing the publication of a file.  This may also be a
list of functions, which will all be called in turn.
@item @code{:htmlized-source}
@tab non-@code{nil} means, publish htmlized source.
@end multitable

The function must accept three arguments: a property list containing at least
a @code{:publishing-directory} property, the name of the file to be published
and the path to the publishing directory of the output file.  It should take
the specified file, make the necessary transformation (if any) and place the
result into the destination folder.

@node Publishing options, Publishing links, Publishing action, Configuration
@subsection Options for the exporters
@cindex options, for publishing

The property list can be used to set many export options for the exporters.
In most cases, these properties correspond to user variables in Org.  The

Most of the @code{org-export-with-*} variables have the same effect in each
exporter.

@vindex org-publish-project-alist
When a property is given a value in @code{org-publish-project-alist}, its
setting overrides the value of the corresponding user variable (if any)
during publishing.  Options set within a file (@pxref{Export settings}),
however, override everything.

@node Publishing links, Sitemap, Publishing options, Configuration
@subsection Links between published files
@cindex links, publishing

To create a link from one Org file to another, you would use something like
@samp{[[file:foo.org][The foo]]} or simply @samp{file:foo.org.}
(@pxref{Hyperlinks}).  When published, this link becomes a link to
@file{foo.html}.  You can thus interlink the pages of your "org web" project
and the links will work as expected when you publish them to HTML@.  If you
also publish the Org source file and want to link to it, use an @code{http:}
link instead of a @code{file:} link, because @code{file:} links are converted
to link to the corresponding @file{html} file.

You may also link to related files, such as images.  Provided you are careful
with relative file names, and provided you have also configured Org to upload
the related files, these links will work too.  See @ref{Complex example}, for
an example of this usage.

@tab Filename for output of sitemap.  Defaults to @file{sitemap.org} (which
becomes @file{sitemap.html}).

@item @code{:sitemap-title}
@tab Title of sitemap page.  Defaults to name of file.

@item @code{:sitemap-function}
@tab Plug-in function to use for generation of the sitemap.
Defaults to @code{org-publish-org-sitemap}, which generates a plain list
of links to all files in the project.

@item @code{:sitemap-sort-folders}
@tab Where folders should appear in the sitemap.  Set this to @code{first}
(default) or @code{last} to display folders first or last,
respectively.  Any other value will mix files and folders.

@item @code{:sitemap-sort-files}
@tab How the files are sorted in the site map.  Set this to
@code{alphabetically} (default), @code{chronologically} or
@code{anti-chronologically}.  @code{chronologically} sorts the files with
older date first while @code{anti-chronologically} sorts the files with newer
date first.  @code{alphabetically} sorts the files alphabetically.  The date of
a file is retrieved with @code{org-publish-find-date}.

@item @code{:sitemap-ignore-case}
@tab Should sorting be case-sensitive?  Default @code{nil}.

@item @code{:sitemap-file-entry-format}
@tab With this option one can tell how a sitemap's entry is formatted in the
sitemap.  This is a format string with some escape sequences: @code{%t} stands
for the title of the file, @code{%a} stands for the author of the file and
@code{%d} stands for the date of the file.  The date is retrieved with the
@code{org-publish-find-date} function and formatted with
@code{org-publish-sitemap-date-format}.  Default @code{%t}.

@item @code{:sitemap-date-format}
@tab Format string for the @code{format-time-string} function that tells how
a sitemap entry's date is to be formatted.  This property bypasses
@code{org-publish-sitemap-date-format} which defaults to @code{%Y-%m-%d}.

@item @code{:sitemap-sans-extension}
@tab When non-@code{nil}, remove filenames' extensions from the generated sitemap.
Useful to have cool URIs (see @uref{http://www.w3.org/Provider/Style/URI}).
Defaults to @code{nil}.

@section Uploading files
@cindex rsync
@cindex unison

For those people already utilizing third party sync tools such as
@command{rsync} or @command{unison}, it might be preferable not to use the built in
@i{remote} publishing facilities of Org mode which rely heavily on
Tramp.  Tramp, while very useful and powerful, tends not to be
so efficient for multiple file transfer and has been known to cause problems
under heavy usage.

Specialized synchronization utilities offer several advantages.  In addition
to timestamp comparison, they also do content and permissions/attribute
checks.  For this reason you might prefer to publish your web to a local
directory (possibly even @i{in place} with your Org files) and then use
@file{unison} or @file{rsync} to do the synchronization with the remote host.

Since Unison (for example) can be configured as to which files to transfer to
a certain remote destination, it can greatly simplify the project publishing
definition.  Simply keep all files in the correct location, process your Org
files with @code{org-publish} and let the synchronization tool do the rest.
You do not need, in this scenario, to include attachments such as @file{jpg},
@file{css} or @file{gif} files in the project definition since the 3rd party
tool syncs them.

Publishing to a local directory is also much faster than to a remote one, so
that you can afford more easily to republish entire projects.  If you set
@code{org-publish-use-timestamps-flag} to @code{nil}, you gain the main
benefit of re-including any changed external files such as source example
files you might include with @code{#+INCLUDE:}.  The timestamp mechanism in
Org is not smart enough to detect if included files have been modified.

This more complicated example publishes an entire website, including
Org files converted to HTML, image files, Emacs Lisp source code, and
style sheets.  The publishing directory is remote and private files are
excluded.

To ensure that links are preserved, care should be taken to replicate
your directory structure on the web server, and to use relative file
paths.  For example, if your Org files are kept in @file{~/org} and your
publishable images in @file{~/images}, you would link to an image with
@c
@example
file:../images/myimage.png
@end example
@c
On the web server, the relative path to the image should be the
same.  You can accomplish this by setting up an "images" folder in the
right place on the web server, and publishing images to it.

Source code can be included in Org mode documents using a @samp{src} block,
e.g.:

@example
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun org-xor (a b)
     "Exclusive or."
     (if a (not b) b))
#+END_SRC
@end example

Org mode provides a number of features for working with live source code,
including editing of code blocks in their native major-mode, evaluation of
code blocks, converting code blocks into source files (known as @dfn{tangling}
in literate programming), and exporting code blocks and their
results in several formats.  This functionality was contributed by Eric
Schulte and Dan Davison, and was originally named Org-babel.

The following sections describe Org mode's code block handling facilities.

Use @kbd{C-c '} to edit the current code block.  This brings up a language
major-mode edit buffer containing the body of the code block.  Manually
saving this buffer with @key{C-x C-s} will write the contents back to the Org
buffer.  You can also set @code{org-edit-src-auto-save-idle-delay} to save the

to auto-save this buffer into a separate file using @code{auto-save-mode}.
Use @kbd{C-c '} again to exit.

The @code{org-src-mode} minor mode will be active in the edit buffer.  The
following variables can be used to configure the behavior of the edit
buffer.  See also the customization group @code{org-edit-structure} for
further configuration options.

@table @code
@item org-src-lang-modes
If an Emacs major-mode named @code{<lang>-mode} exists, where
@code{<lang>} is the language named in the header line of the code block,
then the edit buffer will be placed in that major-mode.  This variable
can be used to map arbitrary language names to existing major modes.
@item org-src-window-setup
Controls the way Emacs windows are rearranged when the edit buffer is created.
@item org-src-preserve-indentation
By default, the value is @code{nil}, which means that when code blocks are
evaluated during export or tangled, they are re-inserted into the code block,
which may replace sequences of spaces with tab characters.  When non-nil,
whitespace in code blocks will be preserved during export or tangling,
exactly as it appears.  This variable is especially useful for tangling
languages such as Python, in which whitespace indentation in the output is
critical.
@item org-src-ask-before-returning-to-edit-buffer
By default, Org will ask before returning to an open edit buffer.  Set this
variable to @code{nil} to switch without asking.

@cindex source code, exporting

It is possible to export the @emph{code} of code blocks, the @emph{results}
of code block evaluation, @emph{both} the code and the results of code block
evaluation, or @emph{none}.  For most languages, the default exports code.
However, for some languages (e.g., @code{ditaa}) the default exports the
results of code block evaluation.  For information on exporting code block
bodies, see @ref{Literal examples}.

The @code{:exports} header argument can be used to specify export
behavior:

@subsubheading Header arguments:

@table @code
@item :exports code
The default in most languages.  The body of the code block is exported, as
described in @ref{Literal examples}.
@item :exports results
The code block will be evaluated and the results will be placed in the
Org mode buffer for export, either updating previous results of the code
block located anywhere in the buffer or, if no previous results exist,
placing the results immediately after the code block.  The body of the code
block will not be exported.
@item :exports both
Both the code block and its results will be exported.
@item :exports none
Neither the code block nor its results will be exported.
@end table

It is possible to inhibit the evaluation of code blocks during export.
Setting the @code{org-export-babel-evaluate} variable to @code{nil} will
ensure that no code blocks are evaluated as part of the export process.  This
can be useful in situations where potentially untrusted Org mode files are
exported in an automated fashion, for example when Org mode is used as the
markup language for a wiki.  It is also possible to set this variable to
@code{'inline-only}.  In that case, only inline code blocks will be
evaluated, in order to insert their results.  Non-inline code blocks are
assumed to have their results already inserted in the buffer by manual
evaluation.  This setting is useful to avoid expensive recalculations during
export, not to provide security.

@subsubheading Jumping between code and Org

When tangling code from an Org-mode buffer to a source code file, you'll
frequently find yourself viewing the file of tangled source code (e.g., many
debuggers point to lines of the source code file).  It is useful to be able
to navigate from the tangled source to the Org-mode buffer from which the
code originated.

The @code{org-babel-tangle-jump-to-org} function provides this jumping from
code to Org-mode functionality.  Two header arguments are required for
jumping to work, first the @code{padline} (@ref{padline}) option must be set
to true (the default setting), second the @code{comments} (@ref{comments})
header argument must be set to @code{links}, which will insert comments into
the source code buffer which point back to the original Org-mode file.

@section Evaluating code blocks

@cindex #+RESULTS

Code blocks can be evaluated@footnote{Whenever code is evaluated there is a
potential for that code to do harm.  Org mode provides safeguards to ensure
that code is only evaluated after explicit confirmation from the user.  For
information on these safeguards (and on how to disable them) see @ref{Code
evaluation security}.} and the results of evaluation optionally placed in the
Org mode buffer.  The results of evaluation are placed following a line that
begins by default with @code{#+RESULTS} and optionally a cache identifier
and/or the name of the evaluated code block.  The default value of
@code{#+RESULTS} can be changed with the customizable variable
@code{org-babel-results-keyword}.

By default, the evaluation facility is only enabled for Lisp code blocks
specified as @code{emacs-lisp}.  However, source code blocks in many languages
can be evaluated within Org mode (see @ref{Languages} for a list of supported
languages and @ref{Structure of code blocks} for information on the syntax
used to define a code block).

@kindex C-c C-c
There are a number of ways to evaluate code blocks.  The simplest is to press
@kbd{C-c C-c} or @kbd{C-c C-v e} with the point on a code block@footnote{The
option @code{org-babel-no-eval-on-ctrl-c-ctrl-c} can be used to remove code
evaluation from the @kbd{C-c C-c} key binding.}.  This will call the
@code{org-babel-execute-src-block} function to evaluate the block and insert
its results into the Org mode buffer.
@cindex #+CALL

It is also possible to evaluate named code blocks from anywhere in an Org
mode buffer or an Org mode table.  Live code blocks located in the current
Org mode buffer or in the ``Library of Babel'' (see @ref{Library of Babel})
can be executed.  Named code blocks can be executed with a separate
@code{#+CALL:} line or inline within a block of text.

The syntax of the @code{#+CALL:} line is

@example
#+CALL: <name>(<arguments>)
#+CALL: <name>[<inside header arguments>](<arguments>) <end header arguments>
@end example

The syntax for inline evaluation of named code blocks is

@example
... call_<name>(<arguments>) ...
... call_<name>[<inside header arguments>](<arguments>)[<end header arguments>] ...
@end example

@table @code
@item <name>
The name of the code block to be evaluated (see @ref{Structure of code blocks}).
@item <arguments>
Arguments specified in this section will be passed to the code block.  These
arguments use standard function call syntax, rather than
header argument syntax.  For example, a @code{#+CALL:} line that passes the
number four to a code block named @code{double}, which declares the header
argument @code{:var n=2}, would be written as @code{#+CALL: double(n=4)}.
@item <inside header arguments>
Inside header arguments are passed through and applied to the named code
block.  These arguments use header argument syntax rather than standard
function call syntax.  Inside header arguments affect how the code block is
evaluated.  For example, @code{[:results output]} will collect the results of
everything printed to @code{STDOUT} during execution of the code block.
@item <end header arguments>
End header arguments are applied to the calling instance and do not affect
evaluation of the named code block.  They affect how the results are
incorporated into the Org mode buffer and how the call line is exported.  For
example, @code{:results html} will insert the results of the call line
evaluation in the Org buffer, wrapped in a @code{BEGIN_HTML:} block.

@vindex org-babel-default-header-args
System-wide values of header arguments can be specified by adapting the
@code{org-babel-default-header-args} variable:

@example
:session    => "none"
:results    => "replace"
:exports    => "code"
:cache      => "no"
:noweb      => "no"
@end example

For example, the following example could be used to set the default value of
@code{:noweb} header arguments to @code{yes}.  This would have the effect of
expanding @code{:noweb} references by default when evaluating source code
blocks.

@lisp
(setq org-babel-default-header-args
      (cons '(:noweb . "yes")
            (assq-delete-all :noweb org-babel-default-header-args)))
@end lisp

@node Language-specific header arguments, Header arguments in Org mode properties, System-wide header arguments, Using header arguments
@subsubheading Language-specific header arguments
Each language can define its own set of default header arguments in variable
@code{org-babel-default-header-args:<lang>}, where @code{<lang>} is the name
of the language.  See the language-specific documentation available online at
@uref{http://orgmode.org/worg/org-contrib/babel}.

@node Header arguments in Org mode properties, Language-specific header arguments in Org mode properties, Language-specific header arguments, Using header arguments
@subsubheading Header arguments in Org mode properties

Buffer-wide header arguments may be specified as properties through the use
of @code{#+PROPERTY:} lines placed anywhere in an Org mode file (see
@ref{Property syntax}).

For example the following would set @code{session} to @code{*R*} (only for R
code blocks), and @code{results} to @code{silent} for every code block in the
buffer, ensuring that all execution took place in the same session, and no
results would be inserted into the buffer.

@example
#+PROPERTY: header-args:R  :session *R*
#+PROPERTY: header-args    :results silent
@end example

Header arguments read from Org mode properties can also be set on a
per-subtree basis using property drawers (see @ref{Property syntax}).
@vindex org-use-property-inheritance
When properties are used to set default header arguments, they are always
looked up with inheritance, regardless of the value of
@code{org-use-property-inheritance}.  Properties are evaluated as seen by the
outermost call or source block.@footnote{The deprecated syntax for default
header argument properties, using the name of the header argument as a
property name directly, evaluates the property as seen by the corresponding
source block definition.  This behavior has been kept for backwards
compatibility.}

In the following example the value of
the @code{:cache} header argument will default to @code{yes} in all code
blocks in the subtree rooted at the following heading:

@example
* outline header
  :PROPERTIES:
  :header-args:    :cache yes
  :END:
@end example

@kindex C-c C-x p
@vindex org-babel-default-header-args
Properties defined in this way override the properties set in
@code{org-babel-default-header-args} and are applied for all activated
languages.  It is convenient to use the @code{org-set-property} function
bound to @kbd{C-c C-x p} to set properties in Org mode documents.

@node Language-specific header arguments in Org mode properties, Code block specific header arguments, Header arguments in Org mode properties, Using header arguments
@subsubheading Language-specific header arguments in Org mode properties

Language-specific header arguments are also read from properties
@code{header-args:<lang>} where @code{<lang>} is the name of the language
targeted.  As an example

@example
* Heading
  :PROPERTIES:
  :header-args:clojure:    :session *clojure-1*
  :header-args:R:          :session *R*
  :END:
** Subheading
  :PROPERTIES:
  :header-args:clojure:    :session *clojure-2*
  :END:
@end example

would independently set a default session header argument for R and clojure
for calls and source blocks under subtree ``Heading'' and change to a
different clojure setting for evaluations under subtree ``Subheading'', while
the R session is inherited from ``Heading'' and therefore unchanged.

@node Code block specific header arguments, Header arguments in function calls, Language-specific header arguments in Org mode properties, Using header arguments
@subsubheading Code block specific header arguments

The most common way to assign values to header arguments is at the
code block level.  This can be done by listing a sequence of header
arguments and their values as part of the @code{#+BEGIN_SRC} line.
Properties set in this way override both the values of
@code{org-babel-default-header-args} and header arguments specified as
properties.  In the following example, the @code{:results} header argument
is set to @code{silent}, meaning the results of execution will not be
inserted in the buffer, and the @code{:exports} header argument is set to
@code{code}, meaning only the body of the code block will be
preserved on export to HTML or @LaTeX{}.

@example
#+NAME: factorial
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell :results silent :exports code :var n=0
fac 0 = 1
fac n = n * fac (n-1)
#+END_SRC
@end example
Similarly, it is possible to set header arguments for inline code blocks

@example
src_haskell[:exports both]@{fac 5@}
@end example

Code block header arguments can span multiple lines using @code{#+HEADER:} or
@code{#+HEADERS:} lines preceding a code block or nested between the
@code{#+NAME:} line and the @code{#+BEGIN_SRC} line of a named code block.
@cindex #+HEADER:
@cindex #+HEADERS:

Multi-line header arguments on an un-named code block:

@example
 #+HEADERS: :var data1=1
 #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var data2=2
   (message "data1:%S, data2:%S" data1 data2)
 #+END_SRC

 #+RESULTS:
 : data1:1, data2:2
@end example

Multi-line header arguments on a named code block:

@example
   #+NAME: named-block
   #+HEADER: :var data=2
   #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
     (message "data:%S" data)
   #+END_SRC

   #+RESULTS: named-block
   : data:2

Additional header arguments are defined on a language-specific basis, see
@ref{Languages}.

@node var, results, Specific header arguments, Specific header arguments
@subsubsection @code{:var}
The @code{:var} header argument is used to pass arguments to code blocks.
The specifics of how arguments are included in a code block vary by language;
these are addressed in the language-specific documentation.  However, the
syntax used to specify arguments is the same across all languages.  In every
case, variables require a default value when they are declared.

The values passed to arguments can either be literal values, references, or
Emacs Lisp code (see @ref{var, Emacs Lisp evaluation of variables}).
References include anything in the Org mode file that takes a @code{#+NAME:}
or @code{#+RESULTS:} line: tables, lists, @code{#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE} blocks,
other code blocks and the results of other code blocks.

Note: When a reference is made to another code block, the referenced block
will be evaluated unless it has current cached results (see @ref{cache}).

Argument values can be indexed in a manner similar to arrays (see @ref{var,
Indexable variable values}).

The following syntax is used to pass arguments to code blocks using the
@code{:var} header argument.

@example
:var name=assign
@end example

The argument, @code{assign}, can either be a literal value, such as a string
@samp{"string"} or a number @samp{9}, or a reference to a table, a list, a
literal example, another code block (with or without arguments), or the
results of evaluating another code block.

Here are examples of passing values by reference:

@table @dfn

@item table
an Org mode table named with either a @code{#+NAME:} line

@example
#+NAME: example-table
| 1 |
| 2 |
| 3 |
| 4 |

#+NAME: table-length
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var table=example-table
(length table)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS: table-length
: 4
@end example

@item list
a simple list named with a @code{#+NAME:} line (note that nesting is not
carried through to the source code block)

@example
#+NAME: example-list
  - simple
    - not
    - nested
  - list

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var x=example-list
  (print x)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| simple | list |
@end example

@item code block without arguments
a code block name (from the example above), as assigned by @code{#+NAME:},
optionally followed by parentheses

@example
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var length=table-length()
(* 2 length)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: 8
@end example

@item code block with arguments
a code block name, as assigned by @code{#+NAME:}, followed by parentheses and
optional arguments passed within the parentheses following the
code block name using standard function call syntax

@example
#+NAME: double
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var input=8
(* 2 input)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS: double
: 16

#+NAME: squared
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var input=double(input=1)
(* input input)
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS: squared
: 4
@end example

@item literal example
a literal example block named with a @code{#+NAME:} line

@example
#+NAME: literal-example
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
A literal example
on two lines
#+END_EXAMPLE

#+NAME: read-literal-example
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var x=literal-example
  (concatenate 'string x " for you.")
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS: read-literal-example
: A literal example
: on two lines for you.

@end example

@end table

@subsubheading Indexable variable values
It is possible to reference portions of variable values by ``indexing'' into
the variables.  Indexes are 0 based with negative values counting back from
the end.  If an index is separated by @code{,}s then each subsequent section
will index into the next deepest nesting or dimension of the value.  Note
that this indexing occurs @emph{before} other table related header arguments
like @code{:hlines}, @code{:colnames} and @code{:rownames} are applied.  The
following example assigns the last cell of the first row the table
@code{example-table} to the variable @code{data}:

@example
#+NAME: example-table
| 1 | a |
| 2 | b |
| 3 | c |
| 4 | d |

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var data=example-table[0,-1]
  data
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: a
@end example

Ranges of variable values can be referenced using two integers separated by a
@code{:}, in which case the entire inclusive range is referenced.  For
example the following assigns the middle three rows of @code{example-table}
to @code{data}.

@example
#+NAME: example-table
| 1 | a |
| 2 | b |
| 3 | c |
| 4 | d |
| 5 | 3 |

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var data=example-table[1:3]
  data
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| 2 | b |
| 3 | c |
| 4 | d |
@end example

Additionally, an empty index, or the single character @code{*}, are both
interpreted to mean the entire range and as such are equivalent to
@code{0:-1}, as shown in the following example in which the entire first
column is referenced.

@example
#+NAME: example-table
| 1 | a |
| 2 | b |
| 3 | c |
| 4 | d |

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var data=example-table[,0]
  data
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |
@end example

It is possible to index into the results of code blocks as well as tables.
Any number of dimensions can be indexed.  Dimensions are separated from one
another by commas, as shown in the following example.

@example
#+NAME: 3D
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  '(((1  2  3)  (4  5  6)  (7  8  9))
    ((10 11 12) (13 14 15) (16 17 18))
    ((19 20 21) (22 23 24) (25 26 27)))
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var data=3D[1,,1]
  data
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| 11 | 14 | 17 |
@end example

@subsubheading Emacs Lisp evaluation of variables

Emacs lisp code can be used to initialize variable values.  When a variable
value starts with @code{(}, @code{[}, @code{'} or @code{`} it will be
evaluated as Emacs Lisp and the result of the evaluation will be assigned as
the variable value.  The following example demonstrates use of this
evaluation to reliably pass the file-name of the Org mode buffer to a code
block---note that evaluation of header arguments is guaranteed to take place
in the original Org mode file, while there is no such guarantee for
evaluation of the code block body.

@example
#+BEGIN_SRC sh :var filename=(buffer-file-name) :exports both
  wc -w $filename
#+END_SRC
@end example

Note that values read from tables and lists will not be evaluated as
Emacs Lisp, as shown in the following example.

@example
#+NAME: table
| (a b c) |

#+HEADERS: :var data=table[0,0]
#+BEGIN_SRC perl
  $data
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: (a b c)
@end example

@node results, file, var, Specific header arguments
@subsubsection @code{:results}

There are four classes of @code{:results} header argument.  Only one option
per class may be supplied per code block.

@itemize @bullet
@item
@b{collection} header arguments specify how the results should be collected
from the code block
@item
@b{type} header arguments specify what type of result the code block will
return---which has implications for how they will be processed before
insertion into the Org mode buffer
@item
@b{format} header arguments specify what type of result the code block will
return---which has implications for how they will be inserted into the
Org mode buffer
@item
@b{handling} header arguments specify how the results of evaluating the code
block should be handled.
@end itemize

@subsubheading Collection
The following options are mutually exclusive, and specify how the results
should be collected from the code block.

@itemize @bullet
@item @code{value}
This is the default.  The result is the value of the last statement in the
code block.  This header argument places the evaluation in functional
mode.  Note that in some languages, e.g., Python, use of this result type
requires that a @code{return} statement be included in the body of the source
code block.  E.g., @code{:results value}.
@item @code{output}
The result is the collection of everything printed to STDOUT during the
execution of the code block.  This header argument places the
evaluation in scripting mode.  E.g., @code{:results output}.
@end itemize

@subsubheading Type

The following options are mutually exclusive and specify what type of results
the code block will return.  By default, results are inserted as either a
table or scalar depending on their value.

@itemize @bullet
@item @code{table}, @code{vector}
The results should be interpreted as an Org mode table.  If a single value is
returned, it will be converted into a table with one row and one column.
E.g., @code{:results value table}.
@item @code{list}
The results should be interpreted as an Org mode list.  If a single scalar
value is returned it will be converted into a list with only one element.
@item @code{scalar}, @code{verbatim}
The results should be interpreted literally---they will not be
converted into a table.  The results will be inserted into the Org mode
buffer as quoted text.  E.g., @code{:results value verbatim}.
@item @code{file}
The results will be interpreted as the path to a file, and will be inserted
into the Org mode buffer as a file link.  E.g., @code{:results value file}.
@end itemize

@subsubheading Format

The following options are mutually exclusive and specify what type of results
the code block will return.  By default, results are inserted according to the
type as specified above.

@itemize @bullet
@item @code{raw}
The results are interpreted as raw Org mode code and are inserted directly
into the buffer.  If the results look like a table they will be aligned as
such by Org mode.  E.g., @code{:results value raw}.
@item @code{org}
The results are will be enclosed in a @code{BEGIN_SRC org} block.
They are not comma-escaped by default but they will be if you hit @kbd{TAB}
in the block and/or if you export the file.  E.g., @code{:results value org}.
@item @code{html}
Results are assumed to be HTML and will be enclosed in a @code{BEGIN_HTML}
block.  E.g., @code{:results value html}.
@item @code{latex}
Results assumed to be @LaTeX{} and are enclosed in a @code{BEGIN_LaTeX} block.
E.g., @code{:results value latex}.
@item @code{code}
Result are assumed to be parsable code and are enclosed in a code block.
E.g., @code{:results value code}.
@item @code{pp}
The result is converted to pretty-printed code and is enclosed in a code
block.  This option currently supports Emacs Lisp, Python, and Ruby.  E.g.,
@code{:results value pp}.
@item @code{drawer}
The result is wrapped in a RESULTS drawer.  This can be useful for
inserting @code{raw} or @code{org} syntax results in such a way that their
extent is known and they can be automatically removed or replaced.
@end itemize

@subsubheading Handling
The following results options indicate what happens with the
results once they are collected.

@itemize @bullet
@item @code{silent}
The results will be echoed in the minibuffer but will not be inserted into
the Org mode buffer.  E.g., @code{:results output silent}.
@item @code{replace}
The default value.  Any existing results will be removed, and the new results
will be inserted into the Org mode buffer in their place.  E.g.,
@code{:results output replace}.
@item @code{append}
If there are pre-existing results of the code block then the new results will
be appended to the existing results.  Otherwise the new results will be
inserted as with @code{replace}.
@item @code{prepend}
If there are pre-existing results of the code block then the new results will
be prepended to the existing results.  Otherwise the new results will be
inserted as with @code{replace}.
@end itemize

@node file, file-desc, results, Specific header arguments
@subsubsection @code{:file}

The header argument @code{:file} is used to specify an external file in which
to save code block results.  After code block evaluation an Org mode style
@code{[[file:]]} link (see @ref{Link format}) to the file will be inserted
into the Org mode buffer.  Some languages including R, gnuplot, dot, and
ditaa provide special handling of the @code{:file} header argument
automatically wrapping the code block body in the boilerplate code required
to save output to the specified file.  This is often useful for saving
graphical output of a code block to the specified file.

The argument to @code{:file} should be either a string specifying the path to
a file, or a list of two strings in which case the first element of the list
should be the path to a file and the second a description for the link.

@node file-desc, dir, file, Specific header arguments
@subsubsection @code{:file-desc}

The value of the @code{:file-desc} header argument is used to provide a
description for file code block results which are inserted as Org mode links
(see @ref{Link format}).  If the @code{:file-desc} header argument is given
with no value the link path will be placed in both the ``link'' and the
``description'' portion of the Org mode link.

@node dir, exports, file-desc, Specific header arguments
@subsubsection @code{:dir} and remote execution

While the @code{:file} header argument can be used to specify the path to the
output file, @code{:dir} specifies the default directory during code block
execution.  If it is absent, then the directory associated with the current
buffer is used.  In other words, supplying @code{:dir path} temporarily has
the same effect as changing the current directory with @kbd{M-x cd path RET}, and
then not supplying @code{:dir}.  Under the surface, @code{:dir} simply sets
the value of the Emacs variable @code{default-directory}.

When using @code{:dir}, you should supply a relative path for file output
(e.g., @code{:file myfile.jpg} or @code{:file results/myfile.jpg}) in which
case that path will be interpreted relative to the default directory.

In other words, if you want your plot to go into a folder called @file{Work}
in your home directory, you could use

@example
#+BEGIN_SRC R :file myplot.png :dir ~/Work
matplot(matrix(rnorm(100), 10), type="l")
#+END_SRC
@end example

@subsubheading Remote execution
A directory on a remote machine can be specified using tramp file syntax, in
which case the code will be evaluated on the remote machine.  An example is

@example
#+BEGIN_SRC R :file plot.png :dir /dand@@yakuba.princeton.edu:
plot(1:10, main=system("hostname", intern=TRUE))
#+END_SRC
@end example

Text results will be returned to the local Org mode buffer as usual, and file
output will be created on the remote machine with relative paths interpreted
relative to the remote directory.  An Org mode link to the remote file will be
created.

So, in the above example a plot will be created on the remote machine,
and a link of the following form will be inserted in the org buffer:

@example
[[file:/scp:dand@@yakuba.princeton.edu:/home/dand/plot.png][plot.png]]
@end example

Most of this functionality follows immediately from the fact that @code{:dir}
sets the value of the Emacs variable @code{default-directory}, thanks to
tramp.  Those using XEmacs, or GNU Emacs prior to version 23 may need to
install tramp separately in order for these features to work correctly.

@subsubheading Further points

@itemize @bullet
@item
If @code{:dir} is used in conjunction with @code{:session}, although it will
determine the starting directory for a new session as expected, no attempt is
currently made to alter the directory associated with an existing session.
@item
@code{:dir} should typically not be used to create files during export with
@code{:exports results} or @code{:exports both}.  The reason is that, in order
to retain portability of exported material between machines, during export
links inserted into the buffer will @emph{not} be expanded against @code{default
directory}.  Therefore, if @code{default-directory} is altered using
@code{:dir}, it is probable that the file will be created in a location to
which the link does not point.
@end itemize

@node exports, tangle, dir, Specific header arguments
@subsubsection @code{:exports}

The @code{:exports} header argument specifies what should be included in HTML
or @LaTeX{} exports of the Org mode file.

@itemize @bullet
@item @code{code}
The default.  The body of code is included into the exported file.  E.g.,
@code{:exports code}.
@item @code{results}
The result of evaluating the code is included in the exported file.  E.g.,
@code{:exports results}.
@item @code{both}
Both the code and results are included in the exported file.  E.g.,
@code{:exports both}.
@item @code{none}
Nothing is included in the exported file.  E.g., @code{:exports none}.
@end itemize

@node tangle, mkdirp, exports, Specific header arguments
@subsubsection @code{:tangle}

The @code{:tangle} header argument specifies whether or not the code
block should be included in tangled extraction of source code files.

@itemize @bullet
@item @code{tangle}
The code block is exported to a source code file named after the full path
(including the directory) and file name (w/o extension) of the Org mode file.
E.g., @code{:tangle yes}.
@item @code{no}
The default.  The code block is not exported to a source code file.
E.g., @code{:tangle no}.
@item other
Any other string passed to the @code{:tangle} header argument is interpreted
as a path (directory and file name relative to the directory of the Org mode
file) to which the block will be exported.  E.g., @code{:tangle path}.
@end itemize

@node mkdirp, comments, tangle, Specific header arguments
@subsubsection @code{:mkdirp}

The @code{:mkdirp} header argument can be used to create parent directories
of tangled files when missing.  This can be set to @code{yes} to enable
directory creation or to @code{no} to inhibit directory creation.

@node comments, padline, mkdirp, Specific header arguments
@subsubsection @code{:comments}
By default code blocks are tangled to source-code files without any insertion
of comments beyond those which may already exist in the body of the code
block.  The @code{:comments} header argument can be set as follows to control
the insertion of extra comments into the tangled code file.

@itemize @bullet
@item @code{no}
The default.  No extra comments are inserted during tangling.
@item @code{link}
The code block is wrapped in comments which contain pointers back to the
original Org file from which the code was tangled.
@item @code{yes}
A synonym for ``link'' to maintain backwards compatibility.
@item @code{org}
Include text from the Org mode file as a comment.
The text is picked from the leading context of the tangled code and is
limited by the nearest headline or source block as the case may be.
@item @code{both}
Turns on both the ``link'' and ``org'' comment options.
@item @code{noweb}
Turns on the ``link'' comment option, and additionally wraps expanded noweb
references in the code block body in link comments.
@end itemize

@node padline, no-expand, comments, Specific header arguments
@subsubsection @code{:padline}
Control in insertion of padding lines around code block bodies in tangled
code files.  The default value is @code{yes} which results in insertion of
newlines before and after each tangled code block.  The following arguments
are accepted.

@itemize @bullet
@item @code{yes}
Insert newlines before and after each code block body in tangled code files.
@item @code{no}
Do not insert any newline padding in tangled output.
@end itemize

@node no-expand, session, padline, Specific header arguments
@subsubsection @code{:no-expand}

By default, code blocks are expanded with @code{org-babel-expand-src-block}
during tangling.  This has the effect of assigning values to variables
specified with @code{:var} (see @ref{var}), and of replacing ``noweb''
references (see @ref{Noweb reference syntax}) with their targets.  The
@code{:no-expand} header argument can be used to turn off this behavior.

@node session, noweb, no-expand, Specific header arguments
@subsubsection @code{:session}

The @code{:session} header argument starts a session for an interpreted
language where state is preserved.

By default, a session is not started.

A string passed to the @code{:session} header argument will give the session
a name.  This makes it possible to run concurrent sessions for each
interpreted language.

@node noweb, noweb-ref, session, Specific header arguments
@subsubsection @code{:noweb}

The @code{:noweb} header argument controls expansion of ``noweb'' syntax
references (see @ref{Noweb reference syntax}) when the code block is
evaluated, tangled, or exported.  The @code{:noweb} header argument can have
one of the five values: @code{no}, @code{yes}, @code{tangle}, or
@code{no-export} @code{strip-export}.

@itemize @bullet
@item @code{no}
The default.  ``Noweb'' syntax references in the body of the code block will
not be expanded before the code block is evaluated, tangled or exported.
@item @code{yes}
``Noweb'' syntax references in the body of the code block will be
expanded before the code block is evaluated, tangled or exported.
@item @code{tangle}
``Noweb'' syntax references in the body of the code block will be expanded
before the code block is tangled.  However, ``noweb'' syntax references will
not be expanded when the code block is evaluated or exported.
@item @code{no-export}
``Noweb'' syntax references in the body of the code block will be expanded
before the block is evaluated or tangled.  However, ``noweb'' syntax
references will not be expanded when the code block is exported.
@item @code{strip-export}
``Noweb'' syntax references in the body of the code block will be expanded
before the block is evaluated or tangled.  However, ``noweb'' syntax
references will be removed when the code block is exported.
@item @code{eval}
``Noweb'' syntax references in the body of the code block will only be
expanded before the block is evaluated.
@end itemize

@subsubheading Noweb prefix lines
Noweb insertions are now placed behind the line prefix of the
@code{<<reference>>}.
This behavior is illustrated in the following example.  Because the
@code{<<example>>} noweb reference appears behind the SQL comment syntax,
each line of the expanded noweb reference will be commented.

This code block:

@example
-- <<example>>
@end example

expands to:

@example
-- this is the
-- multi-line body of example
@end example

Note that noweb replacement text that does not contain any newlines will not
be affected by this change, so it is still possible to use inline noweb
references.

@node noweb-ref, noweb-sep, noweb, Specific header arguments
@subsubsection @code{:noweb-ref}
When expanding ``noweb'' style references the bodies of all code block with
@emph{either} a block name matching the reference name @emph{or} a
@code{:noweb-ref} header argument matching the reference name will be
concatenated together to form the replacement text.

By setting this header argument at the sub-tree or file level, simple code
block concatenation may be achieved.  For example, when tangling the
following Org mode file, the bodies of code blocks will be concatenated into
the resulting pure code file@footnote{(The example needs property inheritance
to be turned on for the @code{noweb-ref} property, see @ref{Property
inheritance}).}.

@example
 #+BEGIN_SRC sh :tangle yes :noweb yes :shebang #!/bin/sh
   <<fullest-disk>>
 #+END_SRC
 * the mount point of the fullest disk
   :PROPERTIES:
   :noweb-ref: fullest-disk
   :END:

 ** query all mounted disks
 #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   df \
 #+END_SRC

 ** strip the header row
 #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   |sed '1d' \
 #+END_SRC

 ** sort by the percent full
 #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   |awk '@{print $5 " " $6@}'|sort -n |tail -1 \
 #+END_SRC

 ** extract the mount point
 #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   |awk '@{print $2@}'
 #+END_SRC
@end example

The @code{:noweb-sep} (see @ref{noweb-sep}) header argument holds the string
used to separate accumulate noweb references like those above.  By default a
newline is used.

@node noweb-sep, cache, noweb-ref, Specific header arguments
@subsubsection @code{:noweb-sep}

The @code{:noweb-sep} header argument holds the string used to separate
accumulate noweb references (see @ref{noweb-ref}).  By default a newline is
used.

@node cache, sep, noweb-sep, Specific header arguments
@subsubsection @code{:cache}

The @code{:cache} header argument controls the use of in-buffer caching of
the results of evaluating code blocks.  It can be used to avoid re-evaluating
unchanged code blocks.  Note that the @code{:cache} header argument will not
attempt to cache results when the @code{:session} header argument is used,
because the results of the code block execution may be stored in the session
outside of the Org mode buffer.  The @code{:cache} header argument can have
one of two values: @code{yes} or @code{no}.

@itemize @bullet
@item @code{no}
The default.  No caching takes place, and the code block will be evaluated
every time it is called.
@item @code{yes}
Every time the code block is run a SHA1 hash of the code and arguments
passed to the block will be generated.  This hash is packed into the
@code{#+RESULTS:} line and will be checked on subsequent
executions of the code block.  If the code block has not
changed since the last time it was evaluated, it will not be re-evaluated.
@end itemize

Code block caches notice if the value of a variable argument
to the code block has changed.  If this is the case, the cache is
invalidated and the code block is re-run.  In the following example,
@code{caller} will not be re-run unless the results of @code{random} have
changed since it was last run.

@example
 #+NAME: random
 #+BEGIN_SRC R :cache yes
 runif(1)
 #+END_SRC

 #+RESULTS[a2a72cd647ad44515fab62e144796432793d68e1]: random
 0.4659510825295

 #+NAME: caller
 #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :var x=random :cache yes
 x
 #+END_SRC

 #+RESULTS[bec9c8724e397d5df3b696502df3ed7892fc4f5f]: caller
 0.254227238707244
@end example

@node sep, hlines, cache, Specific header arguments
@subsubsection @code{:sep}

The @code{:sep} header argument can be used to control the delimiter used
when writing tabular results out to files external to Org mode.  This is used
either when opening tabular results of a code block by calling the
@code{org-open-at-point} function bound to @kbd{C-c C-o} on the code block,
or when writing code block results to an external file (see @ref{file})
header argument.

By default, when @code{:sep} is not specified output tables are tab
delimited.

@node hlines, colnames, sep, Specific header arguments
@subsubsection @code{:hlines}

Tables are frequently represented with one or more horizontal lines, or
hlines.  The @code{:hlines} argument to a code block accepts the
values @code{yes} or @code{no}, with a default value of @code{no}.

@itemize @bullet
@item @code{no}
Strips horizontal lines from the input table.  In most languages this is the
desired effect because an @code{hline} symbol is interpreted as an unbound
variable and raises an error.  Setting @code{:hlines no} or relying on the
default value yields the following results.

@example
#+NAME: many-cols
| a | b | c |
|---+---+---|
| d | e | f |
|---+---+---|
| g | h | i |

#+NAME: echo-table
#+BEGIN_SRC python :var tab=many-cols
  return tab
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS: echo-table
| a | b | c |
| d | e | f |
| g | h | i |
@end example

@item @code{yes}
Leaves hlines in the table.  Setting @code{:hlines yes} has this effect.

@example
#+NAME: many-cols
| a | b | c |
|---+---+---|
| d | e | f |
|---+---+---|
| g | h | i |

#+NAME: echo-table
#+BEGIN_SRC python :var tab=many-cols :hlines yes
  return tab
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS: echo-table
| a | b | c |
|---+---+---|
| d | e | f |
|---+---+---|
| g | h | i |
@end example
@end itemize

@node colnames, rownames, hlines, Specific header arguments
@subsubsection @code{:colnames}

The @code{:colnames} header argument accepts the values @code{yes},
@code{no}, or @code{nil} for unassigned.  The default value is @code{nil}.
Note that the behavior of the @code{:colnames} header argument may differ
across languages.

@itemize @bullet
@item @code{nil}
If an input table looks like it has column names
(because its second row is an hline), then the column
names will be removed from the table before
processing, then reapplied to the results.

@example
#+NAME: less-cols
| a |
|---|
| b |
| c |

#+NAME: echo-table-again
#+BEGIN_SRC python :var tab=less-cols
  return [[val + '*' for val in row] for row in tab]
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS: echo-table-again
| a  |
|----|
| b* |
| c* |
@end example

Please note that column names are not removed before the table is indexed
using variable indexing @xref{var, Indexable variable values}.

@item @code{no}
No column name pre-processing takes place

@item @code{yes}
Column names are removed and reapplied as with @code{nil} even if the table
does not ``look like'' it has column names (i.e., the second row is not an
hline)
@end itemize

@node rownames, shebang, colnames, Specific header arguments
@subsubsection @code{:rownames}

The @code{:rownames} header argument can take on the values @code{yes} or
@code{no}, with a default value of @code{no}.  Note that Emacs Lisp code
blocks ignore the @code{:rownames} header argument entirely given the ease
with which tables with row names may be handled directly in Emacs Lisp.

@itemize @bullet
@item @code{no}
No row name pre-processing will take place.

@item @code{yes}
The first column of the table is removed from the table before processing,
and is then reapplied to the results.

@example
#+NAME: with-rownames
| one | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 |  5 |
| two | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 |

#+NAME: echo-table-once-again
#+BEGIN_SRC python :var tab=with-rownames :rownames yes
  return [[val + 10 for val in row] for row in tab]
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS: echo-table-once-again
| one | 11 | 12 | 13 | 14 | 15 |
| two | 16 | 17 | 18 | 19 | 20 |
@end example

Please note that row names are not removed before the table is indexed using
variable indexing @xref{var, Indexable variable values}.

@end itemize

@node shebang, tangle-mode, rownames, Specific header arguments
@subsubsection @code{:shebang}

Setting the @code{:shebang} header argument to a string value
(e.g., @code{:shebang "#!/bin/bash"}) causes the string to be inserted as the
first line of any tangled file holding the code block, and the file
permissions of the tangled file are set to make it executable.


@node tangle-mode, eval, shebang, Specific header arguments
@subsubsection @code{:tangle-mode}

The @code{tangle-mode} header argument controls the permission set on tangled
files.  The value of this header argument will be passed to
@code{set-file-modes}.  For example, to set a tangled file as read only use
@code{:tangle-mode (identity #o444)}, or to set a tangled file as executable
use @code{:tangle-mode (identity #o755)}.  Blocks with @code{shebang}
(@ref{shebang}) header arguments will automatically be made executable unless
the @code{tangle-mode} header argument is also used.  The behavior is
undefined if multiple code blocks with different values for the
@code{tangle-mode} header argument are tangled to the same file.

@node eval, wrap, tangle-mode, Specific header arguments
@subsubsection @code{:eval}
The @code{:eval} header argument can be used to limit the evaluation of
specific code blocks.  The @code{:eval} header argument can be useful for
protecting against the evaluation of dangerous code blocks or to ensure that
evaluation will require a query regardless of the value of the
@code{org-confirm-babel-evaluate} variable.  The possible values of
@code{:eval} and their effects are shown below.

@table @code
@item never or no
The code block will not be evaluated under any circumstances.
@item query
Evaluation of the code block will require a query.
@item never-export or no-export
The code block will not be evaluated during export but may still be called
interactively.
@item query-export
Evaluation of the code block during export will require a query.
@end table

If this header argument is not set then evaluation is determined by the value
of the @code{org-confirm-babel-evaluate} variable see @ref{Code evaluation
security}.

@node wrap, post, eval, Specific header arguments
@subsubsection @code{:wrap}
The @code{:wrap} header argument is used to mark the results of source block
evaluation.  The header argument can be passed a string that will be appended
to @code{#+BEGIN_} and @code{#+END_}, which will then be used to wrap the
results.  If not string is specified then the results will be wrapped in a
@code{#+BEGIN/END_RESULTS} block.

@node post, prologue, wrap, Specific header arguments
@subsubsection @code{:post}
The @code{:post} header argument is used to post-process the results of a
code block execution.  When a post argument is given, the results of the code
block will temporarily be bound to the @code{*this*} variable.  This variable
may then be included in header argument forms such as those used in @ref{var}
header argument specifications allowing passing of results to other code
blocks, or direct execution via Emacs Lisp.

The following example illustrates the usage of the @code{:post} header
argument.

@example
#+name: attr_wrap
#+begin_src sh :var data="" :var width="\\textwidth" :results output
  echo "#+ATTR_LATEX :width $width"
  echo "$data"
#+end_src

#+header: :file /tmp/it.png
#+begin_src dot :post attr_wrap(width="5cm", data=*this*) :results drawer
  digraph@{
          a -> b;
          b -> c;
          c -> a;
  @}
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
:RESULTS:
#+ATTR_LATEX :width 5cm
[[file:/tmp/it.png]]
:END:
@end example

@node prologue, epilogue, post, Specific header arguments
@subsubsection @code{:prologue}
The value of the @code{prologue} header argument will be prepended to the
code block body before execution.  For example, @code{:prologue "reset"} may
be used to reset a gnuplot session before execution of a particular code
block, or the following configuration may be used to do this for all gnuplot
code blocks.  Also see @ref{epilogue}.

@lisp
(add-to-list 'org-babel-default-header-args:gnuplot
             '((:prologue . "reset")))
@end lisp

@node epilogue, , prologue, Specific header arguments
@subsubsection @code{:epilogue}
The value of the @code{epilogue} header argument will be appended to the code
block body before execution.  Also see @ref{prologue}.

@node Results of evaluation, Noweb reference syntax, Header arguments, Working With Source Code
@section Results of evaluation
@cindex code block, results of evaluation
@cindex source code, results of evaluation

The way in which results are handled depends on whether a session is invoked,
as well as on whether @code{:results value} or @code{:results output} is
used.  The following table shows the table possibilities.  For a full listing
of the possible results header arguments see @ref{results}.

@multitable @columnfractions 0.26 0.33 0.41
@item @tab @b{Non-session} @tab @b{Session}
@item @code{:results value} @tab value of last expression @tab value of last expression
@item @code{:results output} @tab contents of STDOUT @tab concatenation of interpreter output
@end multitable

Note: With @code{:results value}, the result in both @code{:session} and
non-session is returned to Org mode as a table (a one- or two-dimensional
vector of strings or numbers) when appropriate.

@subsection Non-session
@subsubsection @code{:results value}
This is the default.  Internally, the value is obtained by wrapping the code
in a function definition in the external language, and evaluating that
function.  Therefore, code should be written as if it were the body of such a
function.  In particular, note that Python does not automatically return a
value from a function unless a @code{return} statement is present, and so a
@samp{return} statement will usually be required in Python.

This is the only one of the four evaluation contexts in which the code is
automatically wrapped in a function definition.

@subsubsection @code{:results output}
The code is passed to the interpreter as an external process, and the
contents of the standard output stream are returned as text.  (In certain
languages this also contains the error output stream; this is an area for
future work.)

@subsection Session
@subsubsection @code{:results value}
The code is passed to an interpreter running as an interactive Emacs inferior
process.  Only languages which provide tools for interactive evaluation of
code have session support, so some language (e.g., C and ditaa) do not
support the @code{:session} header argument, and in other languages (e.g.,
Python and Haskell) which have limitations on the code which may be entered
into interactive sessions, those limitations apply to the code in code blocks
using the @code{:session} header argument as well.

Unless the @code{:results output} option is supplied (see below) the result
returned is the result of the last evaluation performed by the
interpreter.  (This is obtained in a language-specific manner: the value of
the variable @code{_} in Python and Ruby, and the value of @code{.Last.value}
in R).

@subsubsection @code{:results output}
The code is passed to the interpreter running as an interactive Emacs
inferior process.  The result returned is the concatenation of the sequence of
(text) output from the interactive interpreter.  Notice that this is not
necessarily the same as what would be sent to @code{STDOUT} if the same code
were passed to a non-interactive interpreter running as an external
process.  For example, compare the following two blocks:

@example
#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output
 print "hello"
 2
 print "bye"
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: hello
: bye
@end example

In non-session mode, the ``2'' is not printed and does not appear.

@example
#+BEGIN_SRC python :results output :session
 print "hello"
 2
 print "bye"
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: hello
: 2
: bye
@end example

But in @code{:session} mode, the interactive interpreter receives input ``2''
and prints out its value, ``2''.  (Indeed, the other print statements are
unnecessary here).

@node Noweb reference syntax, Key bindings and useful functions, Results of evaluation, Working With Source Code
@section Noweb reference syntax
@cindex code block, noweb reference
@cindex syntax, noweb
@cindex source code, noweb reference

The ``noweb'' (see @uref{http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~nr/noweb/}) Literate
Programming system allows named blocks of code to be referenced by using the
familiar Noweb syntax:

@example
<<code-block-name>>
@end example

When a code block is tangled or evaluated, whether or not ``noweb''
references are expanded depends upon the value of the @code{:noweb} header
argument.  If @code{:noweb yes}, then a Noweb reference is expanded before
evaluation.  If @code{:noweb no}, the default, then the reference is not
expanded before evaluation.  See the @ref{noweb-ref} header argument for
a more flexible way to resolve noweb references.

It is possible to include the @emph{results} of a code block rather than the
body.  This is done by appending parenthesis to the code block name which may
optionally contain arguments to the code block as shown below.

@example
<<code-block-name(optional arguments)>>
@end example

Note: the default value, @code{:noweb no}, was chosen to ensure that
correct code is not broken in a language, such as Ruby, where
@code{<<arg>>} is a syntactically valid construct.  If @code{<<arg>>} is not
syntactically valid in languages that you use, then please consider setting
the default value.

Note: if noweb tangling is slow in large Org mode files consider setting the
@code{org-babel-use-quick-and-dirty-noweb-expansion} variable to @code{t}.
This will result in faster noweb reference resolution at the expense of not
correctly resolving inherited values of the @code{:noweb-ref} header
argument.

Emacs would not be Emacs without completion, and Org mode uses it whenever it
makes sense.  If you prefer an @i{iswitchb}- or @i{ido}-like interface for
some of the completion prompts, you can specify your preference by setting at
most one of the variables @code{org-completion-use-iswitchb}
@code{org-completion-use-ido}.

Org supports in-buffer completion.  This type of completion does
not make use of the minibuffer.  You simply type a few letters into
the buffer and use the key to complete text right there.

@section Easy Templates
@cindex template insertion
@cindex insertion, of templates

Org mode supports insertion of empty structural elements (like
@code{#+BEGIN_SRC} and @code{#+END_SRC} pairs) with just a few key
strokes.  This is achieved through a native template expansion mechanism.
Note that Emacs has several other template mechanisms which could be used in
a similar way, for example @file{yasnippet}.

To insert a structural element, type a @samp{<}, followed by a template
selector and @kbd{@key{TAB}}.  Completion takes effect only when the above
keystrokes are typed on a line by itself.

The following template selectors are currently supported.

@multitable @columnfractions 0.1 0.9
@item @kbd{s} @tab @code{#+BEGIN_SRC     ... #+END_SRC}
@item @kbd{e} @tab @code{#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE ... #+END_EXAMPLE}
@item @kbd{q} @tab @code{#+BEGIN_QUOTE   ... #+END_QUOTE}
@item @kbd{v} @tab @code{#+BEGIN_VERSE   ... #+END_VERSE}
@item @kbd{c} @tab @code{#+BEGIN_CENTER  ... #+END_CENTER}
@item @kbd{l} @tab @code{#+BEGIN_LaTeX   ... #+END_LaTeX}
@item @kbd{L} @tab @code{#+LaTeX:}

@item @kbd{A} @tab @code{#+ASCII:}
@item @kbd{i} @tab @code{#+INDEX:} line
@item @kbd{I} @tab @code{#+INCLUDE:} line
@end multitable

For example, on an empty line, typing "<e" and then pressing TAB, will expand
into a complete EXAMPLE template.

You can install additional templates by customizing the variable
@code{org-structure-template-alist}.  See the docstring of the variable for
additional details.

@node Speed keys, Code evaluation security, Easy Templates, Miscellaneous
@section Speed keys
@cindex speed keys
@vindex org-use-speed-commands
@vindex org-speed-commands-user

Single keys can be made to execute commands when the cursor is at the
beginning of a headline, i.e., before the first star.  Configure the variable
@code{org-use-speed-commands} to activate this feature.  There is a
pre-defined list of commands, and you can add more such commands using the
variable @code{org-speed-commands-user}.  Speed keys do not only speed up
navigation and other commands, but they also provide an alternative way to
execute commands bound to keys that are not or not easily available on a TTY,
or on a small mobile device with a limited keyboard.

To see which commands are available, activate the feature and press @kbd{?}
with the cursor at the beginning of a headline.

@node Code evaluation security, Customization, Speed keys, Miscellaneous
@section Code evaluation and security issues

Org provides tools to work with the code snippets, including evaluating them.

Running code on your machine always comes with a security risk.  Badly
written or malicious code can be executed on purpose or by accident.  Org has
default settings which will only evaluate such code if you give explicit
permission to do so, and as a casual user of these features you should leave
these precautions intact.

For people who regularly work with such code, the confirmation prompts can
become annoying, and you might want to turn them off.  This can be done, but
you must be aware of the risks that are involved.

Code evaluation can happen under the following circumstances:

@table @i
@item Source code blocks
Source code blocks can be evaluated during export, or when pressing @kbd{C-c
C-c} in the block.  The most important thing to realize here is that Org mode
files which contain code snippets are, in a certain sense, like executable
files.  So you should accept them and load them into Emacs only from trusted
sources---just like you would do with a program you install on your computer.

Make sure you know what you are doing before customizing the variables
which take off the default security brakes.

@defopt org-confirm-babel-evaluate
When t (the default), the user is asked before every code block evaluation.
When @code{nil}, the user is not asked.  When set to a function, it is called with
two arguments (language and body of the code block) and should return t to
ask and @code{nil} not to ask.
@end defopt

For example, here is how to execute "ditaa" code (which is considered safe)
without asking:

@lisp
(defun my-org-confirm-babel-evaluate (lang body)
  (not (string= lang "ditaa")))  ; don't ask for ditaa
(setq org-confirm-babel-evaluate 'my-org-confirm-babel-evaluate)
@end lisp

@item Following @code{shell} and @code{elisp} links
Org has two link types that can directly evaluate code (@pxref{External
links}).  These links can be problematic because the code to be evaluated is
not visible.

@defopt org-confirm-shell-link-function
Function to queries user about shell link execution.
@end defopt
@defopt org-confirm-elisp-link-function
Functions to query user for Emacs Lisp link execution.
@end defopt

@item Formulas in tables
Formulas in tables (@pxref{The spreadsheet}) are code that is evaluated
either by the @i{calc} interpreter, or by the @i{Emacs Lisp} interpreter.
@end table

@node Customization, In-buffer settings, Code evaluation security, Miscellaneous
@section Customization
@cindex customization
@cindex options, for customization
@cindex variables, for customization

There are more than 500 variables that can be used to customize
Org.  For the sake of compactness of the manual, I am not
describing the variables here.  A structured overview of customization
variables is available with @kbd{M-x org-customize RET}.  Or select
@code{Browse Org Group} from the @code{Org->Customization} menu.  Many
settings can also be activated on a per-file basis, by putting special
lines into the buffer (@pxref{In-buffer settings}).

@node In-buffer settings, The very busy C-c C-c key, Customization, Miscellaneous
@section Summary of in-buffer settings
@cindex in-buffer settings
@cindex special keywords

Org mode uses special lines in the buffer to define settings on a
per-file basis.  These lines start with a @samp{#+} followed by a
keyword, a colon, and then individual words defining a setting.  Several
setting words can be in the same line, but you can also have multiple
lines for the keyword.  While these settings are described throughout
the manual, here is a summary.  After changing any of those lines in the
buffer, press @kbd{C-c C-c} with the cursor still in the line to
activate the changes immediately.  Otherwise they become effective only
when the file is visited again in a new Emacs session.

@vindex org-archive-location
@table @kbd
@item #+ARCHIVE: %s_done::
This line sets the archive location for the agenda file.  It applies for
all subsequent lines until the next @samp{#+ARCHIVE} line, or the end
of the file.  The first such line also applies to any entries before it.
The corresponding variable is @code{org-archive-location}.
@item #+CATEGORY:
This line sets the category for the agenda file.  The category applies
for all subsequent lines until the next @samp{#+CATEGORY} line, or the
end of the file.  The first such line also applies to any entries before it.
@item #+COLUMNS: %25ITEM ...
@cindex property, COLUMNS
Set the default format for columns view.  This format applies when
columns view is invoked in locations where no @code{COLUMNS} property
applies.
@item #+CONSTANTS: name1=value1 ...
@vindex org-table-formula-constants
@vindex org-table-formula
Set file-local values for constants to be used in table formulas.  This
line sets the local variable @code{org-table-formula-constants-local}.
The global version of this variable is
@code{org-table-formula-constants}.
@item #+FILETAGS: :tag1:tag2:tag3:
Set tags that can be inherited by any entry in the file, including the
top-level entries.
@item #+DRAWERS: NAME1 ...
@vindex org-drawers
Set the file-local set of additional drawers.  The corresponding global
variable is @code{org-drawers}.
@item #+LINK: linkword replace
@vindex org-link-abbrev-alist
These lines (several are allowed) specify link abbreviations.
@xref{Link abbreviations}.  The corresponding variable is
@code{org-link-abbrev-alist}.
@item #+PRIORITIES: highest lowest default
@vindex org-highest-priority
@vindex org-lowest-priority
@vindex org-default-priority
This line sets the limits and the default for the priorities.  All three
must be either letters A--Z or numbers 0--9.  The highest priority must
have a lower ASCII number than the lowest priority.
@item #+PROPERTY: Property_Name Value
This line sets a default inheritance value for entries in the current
buffer, most useful for specifying the allowed values of a property.
@cindex #+SETUPFILE
@item #+SETUPFILE: file
This line defines a file that holds more in-buffer setup.  Normally this is
entirely ignored.  Only when the buffer is parsed for option-setting lines
(i.e., when starting Org mode for a file, when pressing @kbd{C-c C-c} in a
settings line, or when exporting), then the contents of this file are parsed
as if they had been included in the buffer.  In particular, the file can be
any other Org mode file with internal setup.  You can visit the file the
cursor is in the line with @kbd{C-c '}.
@item #+STARTUP:
@cindex #+STARTUP
This line sets options to be used at startup of Org mode, when an
Org file is being visited.

The first set of options deals with the initial visibility of the outline
tree.  The corresponding variable for global default settings is
@code{org-startup-folded}, with a default value @code{t}, which means
@code{overview}.
@vindex org-startup-folded
@cindex @code{overview}, STARTUP keyword
@cindex @code{content}, STARTUP keyword
@cindex @code{showall}, STARTUP keyword
@cindex @code{showeverything}, STARTUP keyword
@example
overview         @r{top-level headlines only}

showall          @r{no folding of any entries}
showeverything   @r{show even drawer contents}
@end example

@vindex org-startup-indented
@cindex @code{indent}, STARTUP keyword
@cindex @code{noindent}, STARTUP keyword
Dynamic virtual indentation is controlled by the variable
@code{org-startup-indented}@footnote{Emacs 23 and Org mode 6.29 are required}
@example
indent     @r{start with @code{org-indent-mode} turned on}
noindent   @r{start with @code{org-indent-mode} turned off}
@end example

@vindex org-startup-align-all-tables
Then there are options for aligning tables upon visiting a file.  This
is useful in files containing narrowed table columns.  The corresponding
variable is @code{org-startup-align-all-tables}, with a default value
@code{nil}.
@cindex @code{align}, STARTUP keyword
@cindex @code{noalign}, STARTUP keyword
@example
align      @r{align all tables}
noalign    @r{don't align tables on startup}
@end example

@vindex org-startup-with-inline-images
When visiting a file, inline images can be automatically displayed.  The
corresponding variable is @code{org-startup-with-inline-images}, with a
default value @code{nil} to avoid delays when visiting a file.
@cindex @code{inlineimages}, STARTUP keyword
@cindex @code{noinlineimages}, STARTUP keyword
@example
inlineimages   @r{show inline images}
noinlineimages @r{don't show inline images on startup}
@end example

@vindex org-startup-with-latex-preview
When visiting a file, @LaTeX{} fragments can be converted to images
automatically.  The variable @code{org-startup-with-latex-preview} which
controls this behavior, is set to @code{nil} by default to avoid delays on
startup.
@cindex @code{latexpreview}, STARTUP keyword
@cindex @code{nolatexpreview}, STARTUP keyword

@cindex C-c C-c, overview

The key @kbd{C-c C-c} has many purposes in Org, which are all
mentioned scattered throughout this manual.  One specific function of
this key is to add @emph{tags} to a headline (@pxref{Tags}).  In many
other circumstances it means something like @emph{``Hey Org, look
here and update according to what you see here''}.  Here is a summary of
what this means in different contexts.

@itemize @minus
@item
If there are highlights in the buffer from the creation of a sparse
tree, or from clock display, remove these highlights.
@item
If the cursor is in one of the special @code{#+KEYWORD} lines, this
triggers scanning the buffer for these lines and updating the
information.
@item
If the cursor is inside a table, realign the table.  This command
works even if the automatic table editor has been turned off.
@item
If the cursor is on a @code{#+TBLFM} line, re-apply the formulas to
the entire table.
@item
If the current buffer is a capture buffer, close the note and file it.
With a prefix argument, file it, without further interaction, to the
default location.
@item
If the cursor is on a @code{<<<target>>>}, update radio targets and
corresponding links in this buffer.
@item
If the cursor is in a property line or at the start or end of a property
drawer, offer property commands.
@item
If the cursor is at a footnote reference, go to the corresponding
definition, and @emph{vice versa}.
@item
If the cursor is on a statistics cookie, update it.
@item
If the cursor is in a plain list item with a checkbox, toggle the status
of the checkbox.
@item
If the cursor is on a numbered item in a plain list, renumber the
ordered list.
@item
If the cursor is on the @code{#+BEGIN} line of a dynamic block, the
block is updated.
@item
If the cursor is at a timestamp, fix the day name in the timestamp.

@section A cleaner outline view
@cindex hiding leading stars
@cindex dynamic indentation
@cindex odd-levels-only outlines
@cindex clean outline view

Some people find it noisy and distracting that the Org headlines start with a
potentially large number of stars, and that text below the headlines is not
indented.  While this is no problem when writing a @emph{book-like} document
where the outline headings are really section headings, in a more
@emph{list-oriented} outline, indented structure is a lot cleaner:

@example
@group
* Top level headline             |    * Top level headline
** Second level                  |      * Second level
*** 3rd level                    |        * 3rd level
some text                        |          some text
*** 3rd level                    |        * 3rd level
more text                        |          more text
* Another top level headline     |    * Another top level headline
@end group
@end example

@noindent

If you are using at least Emacs 23.2@footnote{Emacs 23.1 can actually crash
with @code{org-indent-mode}} and version 6.29 of Org, this kind of view can
be achieved dynamically at display time using @code{org-indent-mode}.  In
this minor mode, all lines are prefixed for display with the necessary amount
of space@footnote{@code{org-indent-mode} also sets the @code{wrap-prefix}
property, such that @code{visual-line-mode} (or purely setting
@code{word-wrap}) wraps long lines (including headlines) correctly indented.
}.  Also headlines are prefixed with additional stars, so that the amount of
indentation shifts by two@footnote{See the variable
@code{org-indent-indentation-per-level}.}  spaces per level.  All headline
stars but the last one are made invisible using the @code{org-hide}
face@footnote{Turning on @code{org-indent-mode} sets
@code{org-hide-leading-stars} to @code{t} and @code{org-adapt-indentation} to
@code{nil}.}; see below under @samp{2.} for more information on how this
works.  You can turn on @code{org-indent-mode} for all files by customizing
the variable @code{org-startup-indented}, or you can turn it on for
individual files using

@example
#+STARTUP: indent
@end example

If you want a similar effect in an earlier version of Emacs and/or Org, or if
you want the indentation to be hard space characters so that the plain text
file looks as similar as possible to the Emacs display, Org supports you in
the following way:

@enumerate
@item
@emph{Indentation of text below headlines}@*
You may indent text below each headline to make the left boundary line up
with the headline, like

@example
*** 3rd level
    more text, now indented
@end example

@vindex org-adapt-indentation
Org supports this with paragraph filling, line wrapping, and structure
editing@footnote{See also the variable @code{org-adapt-indentation}.},
preserving or adapting the indentation as appropriate.

@item
@vindex org-hide-leading-stars
@emph{Hiding leading stars}@* You can modify the display in such a way that
all leading stars become invisible.  To do this in a global way, configure
the variable @code{org-hide-leading-stars} or change this on a per-file basis
with

@example
#+STARTUP: hidestars
#+STARTUP: showstars
@end example

With hidden stars, the tree becomes:

@example
@group
* Top level headline
 * Second level
  * 3rd level
  ...
@end group
@end example

@noindent
@vindex org-hide @r{(face)}
The leading stars are not truly replaced by whitespace, they are only
fontified with the face @code{org-hide} that uses the background color as
font color.  If you are not using either white or black background, you may
have to customize this face to get the wanted effect.  Another possibility is
to set this font such that the extra stars are @i{almost} invisible, for
example using the color @code{grey90} on a white background.

@item
@vindex org-odd-levels-only
Things become cleaner still if you skip all the even levels and use only odd
levels 1, 3, 5..., effectively adding two stars to go from one outline level
to the next@footnote{When you need to specify a level for a property search
or refile targets, @samp{LEVEL=2} will correspond to 3 stars, etc.}.  In this
way we get the outline view shown at the beginning of this section.  In order
to make the structure editing and export commands handle this convention
correctly, configure the variable @code{org-odd-levels-only}, or set this on
a per-file basis with one of the following lines:

@example
#+STARTUP: odd
#+STARTUP: oddeven
@end example

You can convert an Org file from single-star-per-level to the
double-star-per-level convention with @kbd{M-x org-convert-to-odd-levels
RET} in that file.  The reverse operation is @kbd{M-x
org-convert-to-oddeven-levels}.
@end enumerate

@section Using Org on a tty
@cindex tty key bindings

Because Org contains a large number of commands, by default many of
Org's core commands are bound to keys that are generally not
accessible on a tty, such as the cursor keys (@key{left}, @key{right},
@key{up}, @key{down}), @key{TAB} and @key{RET}, in particular when used
together with modifiers like @key{Meta} and/or @key{Shift}.  To access
these commands on a tty when special keys are unavailable, the following
alternative bindings can be used.  The tty bindings below will likely be
more cumbersome; you may find for some of the bindings below that a
customized workaround suits you better.  For example, changing a timestamp
is really only fun with @kbd{S-@key{cursor}} keys, whereas on a
tty you would rather use @kbd{C-c .} to re-insert the timestamp.

@item @file{calc.el} by Dave Gillespie
Org uses the Calc package for implementing spreadsheet
functionality in its tables (@pxref{The spreadsheet}).  Org
checks for the availability of Calc by looking for the function
@code{calc-eval} which will have been autoloaded during setup if Calc has
been installed properly.  As of Emacs 22, Calc is part of the Emacs
distribution.  Another possibility for interaction between the two
packages is using Calc for embedded calculations.  @xref{Embedded Mode,

@vindex org-table-formula-constants
In a table formula (@pxref{The spreadsheet}), it is possible to use
names for natural constants or units.  Instead of defining your own
constants in the variable @code{org-table-formula-constants}, install
the @file{constants} package which defines a large number of constants
and units, and lets you use unit prefixes like @samp{M} for
@samp{Mega}, etc.  You will need version 2.0 of this package, available
at @url{http://www.astro.uva.nl/~dominik/Tools}.  Org checks for
the function @code{constants-get}, which has to be autoloaded in your
setup.  See the installation instructions in the file
@file{constants.el}.

@cindex Ludlam, Eric M.
Speedbar is a package that creates a special frame displaying files and
index items in files.  Org mode supports Speedbar and allows you to
drill into Org files directly from the Speedbar.  It also allows you to
restrict the scope of agenda commands to a file or a subtree by using
the command @kbd{<} in the Speedbar frame.

Complex ASCII tables with automatic line wrapping, column- and row-spanning,
and alignment can be created using the Emacs table package by Takaaki Ota
(@uref{http://sourceforge.net/projects/table}, and also part of Emacs 22).
Org mode will recognize these tables and export them properly.  Because of
interference with other Org mode functionality, you unfortunately cannot edit
these tables directly in the buffer.  Instead, you need to use the command
@kbd{C-c '} to edit them, similar to source code snippets.

@table @kbd
@orgcmd{C-c ',org-edit-special}
Edit a @file{table.el} table.  Works when the cursor is in a table.el table.
@c
@orgcmd{C-c ~,org-table-create-with-table.el}
Insert a @file{table.el} table.  If there is already a table at point, this
command converts it between the @file{table.el} format and the Org mode
format.  See the documentation string of the command
@code{org-convert-table} for the restrictions under which this is
possible.

@node Conflicts,  , Cooperation, Interaction
@subsection Packages that lead to conflicts with Org mode

@table @asis

@cindex @code{shift-selection-mode}
@vindex org-support-shift-select
In Emacs 23, @code{shift-selection-mode} is on by default, meaning that
cursor motions combined with the shift key should start or enlarge regions.
This conflicts with the use of @kbd{S-@key{cursor}} commands in Org to change
timestamps, TODO keywords, priorities, and item bullet types if the cursor is
at such a location.  By default, @kbd{S-@key{cursor}} commands outside
special contexts don't do anything, but you can customize the variable
@code{org-support-shift-select}.  Org mode then tries to accommodate shift
selection by (i) using it outside of the special contexts where special
commands apply, and by (ii) extending an existing active region even if the
cursor moves across a special context.

@item @file{CUA.el} by Kim. F. Storm
@cindex @file{CUA.el}
@cindex Storm, Kim. F.
@vindex org-replace-disputed-keys
Key bindings in Org conflict with the @kbd{S-<cursor>} keys used by CUA mode
(as well as @code{pc-select-mode} and @code{s-region-mode}) to select and extend the
region.  In fact, Emacs 23 has this built-in in the form of
@code{shift-selection-mode}, see previous paragraph.  If you are using Emacs
23, you probably don't want to use another package for this purpose.  However,
if you prefer to leave these keys to a different package while working in
Org mode, configure the variable @code{org-replace-disputed-keys}.  When set,
Org will move the following key bindings in Org files, and in the agenda
buffer (but not during date selection).

@example
S-UP      @result{}  M-p             S-DOWN     @result{}  M-n
S-LEFT    @result{}  M--             S-RIGHT    @result{}  M-+
C-S-LEFT  @result{}  M-S--           C-S-RIGHT  @result{}  M-S-+
@end example

@vindex org-disputed-keys
Yes, these are unfortunately more difficult to remember.  If you want
to have other replacement keys, look at the variable
@code{org-disputed-keys}.

@item @file{ecomplete.el} by Lars Magne Ingebrigtsen @email{larsi@@gnus.org}
@cindex @file{ecomplete.el}

Ecomplete provides ``electric'' address completion in address header
lines in message buffers.  Sadly Orgtbl mode cuts ecompletes power
supply: No completion happens when Orgtbl mode is enabled in message
buffers while entering text in address header lines.  If one wants to
use ecomplete one should @emph{not} follow the advice to automagically
turn on Orgtbl mode in message buffers (see @ref{Orgtbl mode}), but
instead---after filling in the message headers---turn on Orgtbl mode
manually when needed in the messages body.

@item @file{filladapt.el} by Kyle Jones
@cindex @file{filladapt.el}

Org mode tries to do the right thing when filling paragraphs, list items and
other elements.  Many users reported they had problems using both
@file{filladapt.el} and Org mode, so a safe thing to do is to disable it like
this:

@lisp
(add-hook 'org-mode-hook 'turn-off-filladapt-mode)
@end lisp

@item @file{yasnippet.el}
@cindex @file{yasnippet.el}
The way Org mode binds the @key{TAB} key (binding to @code{[tab]} instead of
@code{"\t"}) overrules YASnippet's access to this key.  The following code
fixed this problem:

@lisp
(add-hook 'org-mode-hook
          (lambda ()
            (org-set-local 'yas/trigger-key [tab])
            (define-key yas/keymap [tab] 'yas/next-field-or-maybe-expand)))
@end lisp

The latest version of yasnippet doesn't play well with Org mode.  If the
above code does not fix the conflict, start by defining the following
function:

@lisp
(defun yas/org-very-safe-expand ()
  (let ((yas/fallback-behavior 'return-nil)) (yas/expand)))
@end lisp

Then, tell Org mode what to do with the new function:

@lisp
(add-hook 'org-mode-hook
          (lambda ()
            (make-variable-buffer-local 'yas/trigger-key)
            (setq yas/trigger-key [tab])
            (add-to-list 'org-tab-first-hook 'yas/org-very-safe-expand)
            (define-key yas/keymap [tab] 'yas/next-field)))
@end lisp

@item @file{windmove.el} by Hovav Shacham
@cindex @file{windmove.el}
This package also uses the @kbd{S-<cursor>} keys, so everything written
in the paragraph above about CUA mode also applies here.  If you want make
the windmove function active in locations where Org mode does not have
special functionality on @kbd{S-@key{cursor}}, add this to your
configuration:

@lisp
;; Make windmove work in org-mode:
(add-hook 'org-shiftup-final-hook 'windmove-up)
(add-hook 'org-shiftleft-final-hook 'windmove-left)
(add-hook 'org-shiftdown-final-hook 'windmove-down)
(add-hook 'org-shiftright-final-hook 'windmove-right)
@end lisp

@item @file{viper.el} by Michael Kifer
@cindex @file{viper.el}
@kindex C-c /
Viper uses @kbd{C-c /} and therefore makes this key not access the
corresponding Org mode command @code{org-sparse-tree}.  You need to find
another key for this command, or override the key in
@code{viper-vi-global-user-map} with

@lisp
(define-key viper-vi-global-user-map "C-c /" 'org-sparse-tree)
@end lisp

@node org-crypt,  , Interaction, Miscellaneous
@section org-crypt.el
@cindex @file{org-crypt.el}
@cindex @code{org-decrypt-entry}

Org-crypt will encrypt the text of an entry, but not the headline, or
properties.  Org-crypt uses the Emacs EasyPG library to encrypt and decrypt
files.

Any text below a headline that has a @samp{:crypt:} tag will be automatically
be encrypted when the file is saved.  If you want to use a different tag just
customize the @code{org-crypt-tag-matcher} setting.

To use org-crypt it is suggested that you have the following in your
@file{.emacs}:

@lisp
(require 'org-crypt)
(org-crypt-use-before-save-magic)
(setq org-tags-exclude-from-inheritance (quote ("crypt")))

(setq org-crypt-key nil)
  ;; GPG key to use for encryption
  ;; Either the Key ID or set to nil to use symmetric encryption.

(setq auto-save-default nil)
  ;; Auto-saving does not cooperate with org-crypt.el: so you need
  ;; to turn it off if you plan to use org-crypt.el quite often.
  ;; Otherwise, you'll get an (annoying) message each time you
  ;; start Org.

  ;; To turn it off only locally, you can insert this:
  ;;
  ;; # -*- buffer-auto-save-file-name: nil; -*-
@end lisp

Excluding the crypt tag from inheritance prevents already encrypted text
being encrypted again.

The next line calls @code{org-add-link-type} to define a new link type
with prefix @samp{man}.  The call also contains the name of a function

@item
@vindex org-store-link-functions
The next line adds a function to @code{org-store-link-functions}, in
order to allow the command @kbd{C-c l} to record a useful link in a
buffer displaying a man page.
@end enumerate

The rest of the file defines the necessary variables and functions.
First there is a customization variable that determines which Emacs
command should be used to display man pages.  There are two options,
@code{man} and @code{woman}.  Then the function to follow a link is
defined.  It gets the link path as an argument---in this case the link
path is just a topic for the manual command.  The function calls the
value of @code{org-man-command} to display the man page.

Finally the function @code{org-man-store-link} is defined.  When you try
to store a link with @kbd{C-c l}, this function will be called to
try to make a link.  The function must first decide if it is supposed to
create the link for this buffer type; we do this by checking the value
of the variable @code{major-mode}.  If not, the function must exit and
return the value @code{nil}.  If yes, the link is created by getting the
manual topic from the buffer name and prefixing it with the string
@samp{man:}.  Then it must call the command @code{org-store-link-props}
and set the @code{:type} and @code{:link} properties.  Optionally you
can also set the @code{:description} property to provide a default for
the link description when the link is later inserted into an Org
buffer with @kbd{C-c C-l}.

When it makes sense for your new link type, you may also define a function
@code{org-PREFIX-complete-link} that implements special (e.g., completion)
support for inserting such a link with @kbd{C-c C-l}.  Such a function should
not accept any arguments, and return the full link with prefix.

@section Adding export back-ends
@cindex Export, writing back-ends

Org 8.0 comes with a completely rewritten export engine which makes it easy
to write new export back-ends, either from scratch, or from deriving them
from existing ones.

Your two entry points are respectively @code{org-export-define-backend} and
@code{org-export-define-derived-backend}.  To grok these functions, you
should first have a look at @file{ox-latex.el} (for how to define a new
back-end from scratch) and @file{ox-beamer.el} (for how to derive a new
back-end from an existing one.

When creating a new back-end from scratch, the basic idea is to set the name
of the back-end (as a symbol) and an an alist of elements and export
functions.  On top of this, you will need to set additional keywords like
@code{:menu-entry} (to display the back-end in the export dispatcher),
@code{:export-block} (to specify what blocks should not be exported by this
back-end), and @code{:options-alist} (to let the user set export options that
are specific to this back-end.)

Deriving a new back-end is similar, except that you need to set
@code{:translate-alist} to an alist of export functions that should be used
instead of the parent back-end functions.

For a complete reference documentation, see
@url{http://orgmode.org/worg/dev/org-export-reference.html, the Org Export
Reference on Worg}.

@node Context-sensitive commands, Tables in arbitrary syntax, Adding export back-ends, Hacking
@section Context-sensitive commands
@cindex context-sensitive commands, hooks
@cindex add-ons, context-sensitive commands
@vindex org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c-hook

Org has several commands that act differently depending on context.  The most
important example is the @kbd{C-c C-c} (@pxref{The very busy C-c C-c key}).
Also the @kbd{M-cursor} and @kbd{M-S-cursor} keys have this property.

Add-ons can tap into this functionality by providing a function that detects
special context for that add-on and executes functionality appropriate for
the context.  Here is an example from Dan Davison's @file{org-R.el} which
allows you to evaluate commands based on the @file{R} programming language
@footnote{@file{org-R.el} has been replaced by the Org mode functionality
described in @ref{Working With Source Code} and is now obsolete.}.  For this
package, special contexts are lines that start with @code{#+R:} or
@code{#+RR:}.

@lisp
(defun org-R-apply-maybe ()
  "Detect if this is context for org-R and execute R commands."
  (if (save-excursion
        (beginning-of-line 1)
        (looking-at "#\\+RR?:"))
      (progn (call-interactively 'org-R-apply)
             t) ;; to signal that we took action
    nil)) ;; to signal that we did not

(add-hook 'org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c-hook 'org-R-apply-maybe)
@end lisp

The function first checks if the cursor is in such a line.  If that is the
case, @code{org-R-apply} is called and the function returns @code{t} to
signal that action was taken, and @kbd{C-c C-c} will stop looking for other
contexts.  If the function finds it should do nothing locally, it returns
@code{nil} so that other, similar functions can have a try.


@node Tables in arbitrary syntax, Dynamic blocks, Context-sensitive commands, Hacking
@section Tables and lists in arbitrary syntax
@cindex tables, in other modes
@cindex lists, in other modes
@cindex Orgtbl mode

Since Orgtbl mode can be used as a minor mode in arbitrary buffers, a
frequent feature request has been to make it work with native tables in
specific languages, for example @LaTeX{}.  However, this is extremely
hard to do in a general way, would lead to a customization nightmare,
and would take away much of the simplicity of the Orgtbl mode table
editor.

This appendix describes a different approach.  We keep the Orgtbl mode
table in its native format (the @i{source table}), and use a custom
function to @i{translate} the table to the correct syntax, and to
@i{install} it in the right location (the @i{target table}).  This puts
the burden of writing conversion functions on the user, but it allows
for a very flexible system.

Bastien added the ability to do the same with lists, in Orgstruct mode.  You
can use Org's facilities to edit and structure lists by turning
@code{orgstruct-mode} on, then locally exporting such lists in another format
(HTML, @LaTeX{} or Texinfo.)

@node Radio tables, A @LaTeX{} example, Tables in arbitrary syntax, Tables in arbitrary syntax
@subsection Radio tables
@cindex radio tables

To define the location of the target table, you first need to create two
lines that are comments in the current mode, but contain magic words
@code{BEGIN/END RECEIVE ORGTBL} for Orgtbl mode to find.  Orgtbl mode will
insert the translated table between these lines, replacing whatever was there
before.  For example in C mode where comments are between @code{/* ... */}:

@example
/* BEGIN RECEIVE ORGTBL table_name */
/* END RECEIVE ORGTBL table_name */
@end example

@noindent
Just above the source table, we put a special line that tells
Orgtbl mode how to translate this table and where to install it.  For
example:
@cindex #+ORGTBL
@example
#+ORGTBL: SEND table_name translation_function arguments...
@end example

@noindent
@code{table_name} is the reference name for the table that is also used
in the receiver lines.  @code{translation_function} is the Lisp function
that does the translation.  Furthermore, the line can contain a list of
arguments (alternating key and value) at the end.  The arguments will be
passed as a property list to the translation function for
interpretation.  A few standard parameters are already recognized and
acted upon before the translation function is called:

@table @code
@item :skip N
Skip the first N lines of the table.  Hlines do count as separate lines for
this parameter!

@item :skipcols (n1 n2 ...)
List of columns that should be skipped.  If the table has a column with
calculation marks, that column is automatically discarded as well.
Please note that the translator function sees the table @emph{after} the
removal of these columns, the function never knows that there have been
additional columns.

@item :no-escape t
When non-@code{nil}, do not escape special characters @code{&%#_^} when exporting
the table.  The default value is @code{nil}.
@end table

@noindent
The one problem remaining is how to keep the source table in the buffer
without disturbing the normal workings of the file, for example during
compilation of a C file or processing of a @LaTeX{} file.  There are a
number of different solutions:

@itemize @bullet
@item
The table could be placed in a block comment if that is supported by the
language.  For example, in C mode you could wrap the table between
@samp{/*} and @samp{*/} lines.
@item
Sometimes it is possible to put the table after some kind of @i{END}
statement, for example @samp{\bye} in @TeX{} and @samp{\end@{document@}}
in @LaTeX{}.
@item
You can just comment the table line-by-line whenever you want to process
the file, and uncomment it whenever you need to edit the table.  This
only sounds tedious---the command @kbd{M-x orgtbl-toggle-comment RET}
makes this comment-toggling very easy, in particular if you bind it to a
key.
@end itemize

@node A @LaTeX{} example, Translator functions, Radio tables, Tables in arbitrary syntax
@subsection A @LaTeX{} example of radio tables
@cindex @LaTeX{}, and Orgtbl mode

The best way to wrap the source table in @LaTeX{} is to use the
@code{comment} environment provided by @file{comment.sty}.  It has to be
activated by placing @code{\usepackage@{comment@}} into the document
header.  Orgtbl mode can insert a radio table skeleton@footnote{By
default this works only for @LaTeX{}, HTML, and Texinfo.  Configure the
variable @code{orgtbl-radio-table-templates} to install templates for other
modes.}  with the command @kbd{M-x orgtbl-insert-radio-table RET}.  You will
be prompted for a table name, let's say we use @samp{salesfigures}.  You
will then get the following template:

@cindex #+ORGTBL, SEND
@example
% BEGIN RECEIVE ORGTBL salesfigures
% END RECEIVE ORGTBL salesfigures
\begin@{comment@}
#+ORGTBL: SEND salesfigures orgtbl-to-latex
| | |
\end@{comment@}
@end example

@noindent
@vindex @LaTeX{}-verbatim-environments
The @code{#+ORGTBL: SEND} line tells Orgtbl mode to use the function
@code{orgtbl-to-latex} to convert the table into @LaTeX{} and to put it
into the receiver location with name @code{salesfigures}.  You may now
fill in the table---feel free to use the spreadsheet features@footnote{If
the @samp{#+TBLFM} line contains an odd number of dollar characters,
this may cause problems with font-lock in @LaTeX{} mode.  As shown in the
example you can fix this by adding an extra line inside the
@code{comment} environment that is used to balance the dollar
expressions.  If you are using AUC@TeX{} with the font-latex library, a
much better solution is to add the @code{comment} environment to the
variable @code{LaTeX-verbatim-environments}.}:

@example
% BEGIN RECEIVE ORGTBL salesfigures
% END RECEIVE ORGTBL salesfigures
\begin@{comment@}
#+ORGTBL: SEND salesfigures orgtbl-to-latex
| Month | Days | Nr sold | per day |
|-------+------+---------+---------|
| Jan   |   23 |      55 |     2.4 |
| Feb   |   21 |      16 |     0.8 |
| March |   22 |     278 |    12.6 |
#+TBLFM: $4=$3/$2;%.1f
% $ (optional extra dollar to keep font-lock happy, see footnote)
\end@{comment@}
@end example

@noindent
When you are done, press @kbd{C-c C-c} in the table to get the converted
table inserted between the two marker lines.

Now let's assume you want to make the table header by hand, because you
want to control how columns are aligned, etc.  In this case we make sure
that the table translator skips the first 2 lines of the source
table, and tell the command to work as a @i{splice}, i.e., to not produce
header and footer commands of the target table:

@example
\begin@{tabular@}@{lrrr@}
Month & \multicolumn@{1@}@{c@}@{Days@} & Nr.\ sold & per day\\
% BEGIN RECEIVE ORGTBL salesfigures
% END RECEIVE ORGTBL salesfigures
\end@{tabular@}
%
\begin@{comment@}
#+ORGTBL: SEND salesfigures orgtbl-to-latex :splice t :skip 2
| Month | Days | Nr sold | per day |
|-------+------+---------+---------|
| Jan   |   23 |      55 |     2.4 |
| Feb   |   21 |      16 |     0.8 |
| March |   22 |     278 |    12.6 |
#+TBLFM: $4=$3/$2;%.1f
\end@{comment@}
@end example

The @LaTeX{} translator function @code{orgtbl-to-latex} is already part of
Orgtbl mode.  It uses a @code{tabular} environment to typeset the table
and marks horizontal lines with @code{\hline}.  Furthermore, it
interprets the following parameters (see also @pxref{Translator functions}):

@table @code
@item :splice nil/t
When set to t, return only table body lines, don't wrap them into a
tabular environment.  Default is @code{nil}.

@item :fmt fmt
A format to be used to wrap each field, it should contain @code{%s} for the
original field value.  For example, to wrap each field value in dollars,
you could use @code{:fmt "$%s$"}.  This may also be a property list with
column numbers and formats, for example @code{:fmt (2 "$%s$" 4 "%s\\%%")}.
A function of one argument can be used in place of the strings; the
function must return a formatted string.

@item :efmt efmt
Use this format to print numbers with exponentials.  The format should
have @code{%s} twice for inserting mantissa and exponent, for example
@code{"%s\\times10^@{%s@}"}.  The default is @code{"%s\\,(%s)"}.  This
may also be a property list with column numbers and formats, for example
@code{:efmt (2 "$%s\\times10^@{%s@}$" 4 "$%s\\cdot10^@{%s@}$")}.  After
@code{efmt} has been applied to a value, @code{fmt} will also be
applied.  Similar to @code{fmt}, functions of two arguments can be
supplied instead of strings.

@node Translator functions, Radio lists, A @LaTeX{} example, Tables in arbitrary syntax
@subsection Translator functions
@cindex HTML, and Orgtbl mode
@cindex translator function

Orgtbl mode has several translator functions built-in: @code{orgtbl-to-csv}
(comma-separated values), @code{orgtbl-to-tsv} (TAB-separated values)
@code{orgtbl-to-latex}, @code{orgtbl-to-html}, and @code{orgtbl-to-texinfo}.
Except for @code{orgtbl-to-html}@footnote{The HTML translator uses the same
code that produces tables during HTML export.}, these all use a generic
translator, @code{orgtbl-to-generic}.  For example, @code{orgtbl-to-latex}
itself is a very short function that computes the column definitions for the
@code{tabular} environment, defines a few field and line separators and then
hands processing over to the generic translator.  Here is the entire code:

@lisp
@group
(defun orgtbl-to-latex (table params)
  "Convert the Orgtbl mode TABLE to LaTeX."
  (let* ((alignment (mapconcat (lambda (x) (if x "r" "l"))
                               org-table-last-alignment ""))
         (params2
          (list
           :tstart (concat "\\begin@{tabular@}@{" alignment "@}")
           :tend "\\end@{tabular@}"
           :lstart "" :lend " \\\\" :sep " & "
           :efmt "%s\\,(%s)" :hline "\\hline")))
    (orgtbl-to-generic table (org-combine-plists params2 params))))
@end group
@end lisp

As you can see, the properties passed into the function (variable
@var{PARAMS}) are combined with the ones newly defined in the function
(variable @var{PARAMS2}).  The ones passed into the function (i.e., the
ones set by the @samp{ORGTBL SEND} line) take precedence.  So if you
would like to use the @LaTeX{} translator, but wanted the line endings to
be @samp{\\[2mm]} instead of the default @samp{\\}, you could just
overrule the default with

@example
#+ORGTBL: SEND test orgtbl-to-latex :lend " \\\\[2mm]"
@end example

For a new language, you can either write your own converter function in
analogy with the @LaTeX{} translator, or you can use the generic function
directly.  For example, if you have a language where a table is started
with @samp{!BTBL!}, ended with @samp{!ETBL!}, and where table lines are
started with @samp{!BL!}, ended with @samp{!EL!}, and where the field
separator is a TAB, you could call the generic translator like this (on
a single line!):

@example
#+ORGTBL: SEND test orgtbl-to-generic :tstart "!BTBL!" :tend "!ETBL!"
                              :lstart "!BL! " :lend " !EL!" :sep "\t"
@end example

@noindent
Please check the documentation string of the function
@code{orgtbl-to-generic} for a full list of parameters understood by
that function, and remember that you can pass each of them into
@code{orgtbl-to-latex}, @code{orgtbl-to-texinfo}, and any other function
using the generic function.

Of course you can also write a completely new function doing complicated
things the generic translator cannot do.  A translator function takes
two arguments.  The first argument is the table, a list of lines, each
line either the symbol @code{hline} or a list of fields.  The second
argument is the property list containing all parameters specified in the
@samp{#+ORGTBL: SEND} line.  The function must return a single string
containing the formatted table.  If you write a generally useful
translator, please post it on @email{emacs-orgmode@@gnu.org} so that
others can benefit from your work.

@node Radio lists,  , Translator functions, Tables in arbitrary syntax
@subsection Radio lists
@cindex radio lists
@cindex org-list-insert-radio-list

Sending and receiving radio lists works exactly the same way as sending and
receiving radio tables (@pxref{Radio tables}).  As for radio tables, you can
insert radio list templates in HTML, @LaTeX{} and Texinfo modes by calling
@code{org-list-insert-radio-list}.

Here are the differences with radio tables:

@itemize @minus
@item
Orgstruct mode must be active.
@item
Use the @code{ORGLST} keyword instead of @code{ORGTBL}.
@item
The available translation functions for radio lists don't take
parameters.
@item
@kbd{C-c C-c} will work when pressed on the first item of the list.
@end itemize

Here is a @LaTeX{} example.  Let's say that you have this in your
@LaTeX{} file:

@cindex #+ORGLST
@example
% BEGIN RECEIVE ORGLST to-buy
% END RECEIVE ORGLST to-buy
\begin@{comment@}
#+ORGLST: SEND to-buy org-list-to-latex
- a new house
- a new computer
  + a new keyboard
  + a new mouse
- a new life
\end@{comment@}
@end example

Pressing @kbd{C-c C-c} on @code{a new house} and will insert the converted
@LaTeX{} list between the two marker lines.

@node Dynamic blocks, Special agenda views, Tables in arbitrary syntax, Hacking
@section Dynamic blocks
@cindex dynamic blocks

Org documents can contain @emph{dynamic blocks}.  These are
specially marked regions that are updated by some user-written function.
A good example for such a block is the clock table inserted by the
command @kbd{C-c C-x C-r} (@pxref{Clocking work time}).

Dynamic blocks are enclosed by a BEGIN-END structure that assigns a name
to the block and can also specify parameters for the function producing
the content of the block.

@cindex #+BEGIN:dynamic block
@example
#+BEGIN: myblock :parameter1 value1 :parameter2 value2 ...

#+END:
@end example

Dynamic blocks are updated with the following commands

@table @kbd
@orgcmd{C-c C-x C-u,org-dblock-update}
Update dynamic block at point.
@orgkey{C-u C-c C-x C-u}
Update all dynamic blocks in the current file.
@end table

Updating a dynamic block means to remove all the text between BEGIN and
END, parse the BEGIN line for parameters and then call the specific
writer function for this block to insert the new content.  If you want
to use the original content in the writer function, you can use the
extra parameter @code{:content}.

For a block with name @code{myblock}, the writer function is
@code{org-dblock-write:myblock} with as only parameter a property list
with the parameters given in the begin line.  Here is a trivial example
of a block that keeps track of when the block update function was last
run:

@example
#+BEGIN: block-update-time :format "on %m/%d/%Y at %H:%M"

#+END:
@end example

@noindent
The corresponding block writer function could look like this:

@lisp
(defun org-dblock-write:block-update-time (params)
  (let ((fmt (or (plist-get params :format) "%d. %m. %Y")))
    (insert "Last block update at: "
            (format-time-string fmt))))
@end lisp

If you want to make sure that all dynamic blocks are always up-to-date,
you could add the function @code{org-update-all-dblocks} to a hook, for
example @code{before-save-hook}.  @code{org-update-all-dblocks} is
written in a way such that it does nothing in buffers that are not in
@code{org-mode}.

You can narrow the current buffer to the current dynamic block (like any
other block) with @code{org-narrow-to-block}.

@node Special agenda views, Speeding up your agendas, Dynamic blocks, Hacking
@section Special agenda views
@cindex agenda views, user-defined

@vindex org-agenda-skip-function
@vindex org-agenda-skip-function-global
Org provides a special hook that can be used to narrow down the selection
made by these agenda views: @code{agenda}, @code{agenda*}@footnote{The
@code{agenda*} view is the same than @code{agenda} except that it only
considers @emph{appointments}, i.e., scheduled and deadline items that have a
time specification @code{[h]h:mm} in their time-stamps.}, @code{todo},
@code{alltodo}, @code{tags}, @code{tags-todo}, @code{tags-tree}.  You may
specify a function that is used at each match to verify if the match should
indeed be part of the agenda view, and if not, how much should be skipped.
You can specify a global condition that will be applied to all agenda views,
this condition would be stored in the variable
@code{org-agenda-skip-function-global}.  More commonly, such a definition is
applied only to specific custom searches, using
@code{org-agenda-skip-function}.

Let's say you want to produce a list of projects that contain a WAITING
tag anywhere in the project tree.  Let's further assume that you have
marked all tree headings that define a project with the TODO keyword
PROJECT@.  In this case you would run a TODO search for the keyword
PROJECT, but skip the match unless there is a WAITING tag anywhere in
the subtree belonging to the project line.

To achieve this, you must write a function that searches the subtree for
the tag.  If the tag is found, the function must return @code{nil} to
indicate that this match should not be skipped.  If there is no such
tag, return the location of the end of the subtree, to indicate that
search should continue from there.

@lisp
(defun my-skip-unless-waiting ()
  "Skip trees that are not waiting"
  (let ((subtree-end (save-excursion (org-end-of-subtree t))))
    (if (re-search-forward ":waiting:" subtree-end t)
        nil          ; tag found, do not skip
      subtree-end))) ; tag not found, continue after end of subtree
@end lisp

Now you may use this function in an agenda custom command, for example
like this:

@lisp
(org-add-agenda-custom-command
 '("b" todo "PROJECT"
   ((org-agenda-skip-function 'my-skip-unless-waiting)
    (org-agenda-overriding-header "Projects waiting for something: "))))
@end lisp

@vindex org-agenda-overriding-header
Note that this also binds @code{org-agenda-overriding-header} to get a
meaningful header in the agenda view.

@vindex org-odd-levels-only
@vindex org-agenda-skip-function
A general way to create custom searches is to base them on a search for
entries with a certain level limit.  If you want to study all entries with
your custom search function, simply do a search for
@samp{LEVEL>0}@footnote{Note that, when using @code{org-odd-levels-only}, a
level number corresponds to order in the hierarchy, not to the number of
stars.}, and then use @code{org-agenda-skip-function} to select the entries
you really want to have.

You may also put a Lisp form into @code{org-agenda-skip-function}.  In
particular, you may use the functions @code{org-agenda-skip-entry-if}
and @code{org-agenda-skip-subtree-if} in this form, for example:

@table @code
@item (org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'scheduled)
Skip current entry if it has been scheduled.
@item (org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'notscheduled)
Skip current entry if it has not been scheduled.
@item (org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'deadline)
Skip current entry if it has a deadline.
@item (org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'scheduled 'deadline)
Skip current entry if it has a deadline, or if it is scheduled.
@item (org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'todo '("TODO" "WAITING"))
Skip current entry if the TODO keyword is TODO or WAITING.
@item (org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'todo 'done)
Skip current entry if the TODO keyword marks a DONE state.
@item (org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'timestamp)
Skip current entry if it has any timestamp, may also be deadline or scheduled.
@anchor{x-agenda-skip-entry-regexp}
@item (org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'regexp "regular expression")
Skip current entry if the regular expression matches in the entry.
@item (org-agenda-skip-entry-if 'notregexp "regular expression")
Skip current entry unless the regular expression matches.
@item (org-agenda-skip-subtree-if 'regexp "regular expression")
Same as above, but check and skip the entire subtree.
@end table

Therefore we could also have written the search for WAITING projects
like this, even without defining a special function:

@lisp
(org-add-agenda-custom-command
 '("b" todo "PROJECT"
   ((org-agenda-skip-function '(org-agenda-skip-subtree-if
                                'regexp ":waiting:"))
    (org-agenda-overriding-header "Projects waiting for something: "))))

@section Extracting agenda information
@cindex agenda, pipe
@cindex Scripts, for agenda processing

@vindex org-agenda-custom-commands
Org provides commands to access agenda information for the command
line in Emacs batch mode.  This extracted information can be sent
directly to a printer, or it can be read by a program that does further
processing of the data.  The first of these commands is the function
@code{org-batch-agenda}, that produces an agenda view and sends it as
ASCII text to STDOUT@.  The command takes a single string as parameter.
If the string has length 1, it is used as a key to one of the commands
you have configured in @code{org-agenda-custom-commands}, basically any
key you can use after @kbd{C-c a}.  For example, to directly print the
current TODO list, you could use

@example
emacs -batch -l ~/.emacs -eval '(org-batch-agenda "t")' | lpr
@end example

If the parameter is a string with 2 or more characters, it is used as a
tags/TODO match string.  For example, to print your local shopping list
(all items with the tag @samp{shop}, but excluding the tag
@samp{NewYork}), you could use

@example
emacs -batch -l ~/.emacs                                      \
      -eval '(org-batch-agenda "+shop-NewYork")' | lpr
@end example

@noindent
You may also modify parameters on the fly like this:

@example
emacs -batch -l ~/.emacs                                      \
   -eval '(org-batch-agenda "a"                               \
            org-agenda-span (quote month)                     \
            org-agenda-include-diary nil                      \
            org-agenda-files (quote ("~/org/project.org")))'  \
   | lpr
@end example

@noindent
which will produce a 30-day agenda, fully restricted to the Org file
@file{~/org/projects.org}, not even including the diary.

If you want to process the agenda data in more sophisticated ways, you
can use the command @code{org-batch-agenda-csv} to get a comma-separated
list of values for each agenda item.  Each line in the output will
contain a number of fields separated by commas.  The fields in a line
are:

@example
category     @r{The category of the item}
head         @r{The headline, without TODO keyword, TAGS and PRIORITY}
type         @r{The type of the agenda entry, can be}
                todo               @r{selected in TODO match}
                tagsmatch          @r{selected in tags match}
                diary              @r{imported from diary}
                deadline           @r{a deadline}
                scheduled          @r{scheduled}
                timestamp          @r{appointment, selected by timestamp}
                closed             @r{entry was closed on date}
                upcoming-deadline  @r{warning about nearing deadline}
                past-scheduled     @r{forwarded scheduled item}
                block              @r{entry has date block including date}
todo         @r{The TODO keyword, if any}
tags         @r{All tags including inherited ones, separated by colons}
date         @r{The relevant date, like 2007-2-14}
time         @r{The time, like 15:00-16:50}
extra        @r{String with extra planning info}
priority-l   @r{The priority letter if any was given}
priority-n   @r{The computed numerical priority}
@end example

@noindent
Time and date will only be given if a timestamp (or deadline/scheduled)
led to the selection of the item.

A CSV list like this is very easy to use in a post-processing script.
For example, here is a Perl program that gets the TODO list from
Emacs/Org and prints all the items, preceded by a checkbox:

@example
#!/usr/bin/perl

# define the Emacs command to run
$cmd = "emacs -batch -l ~/.emacs -eval '(org-batch-agenda-csv \"t\")'";

# run it and capture the output
$agenda = qx@{$cmd 2>/dev/null@};

# loop over all lines
foreach $line (split(/\n/,$agenda)) @{
  # get the individual values
  ($category,$head,$type,$todo,$tags,$date,$time,$extra,
   $priority_l,$priority_n) = split(/,/,$line);
  # process and print
  print "[ ] $head\n";

@defun org-entry-properties &optional pom which
Get all properties of the entry at point-or-marker POM.@*
This includes the TODO keyword, the tags, time strings for deadline,
scheduled, and clocking, and any additional properties defined in the
entry.  The return value is an alist.  Keys may occur multiple times
if the property key was used several times.@*
POM may also be @code{nil}, in which case the current entry is used.
If WHICH is @code{nil} or @code{all}, get all properties.  If WHICH is

@findex org-insert-property-drawer
@defun org-entry-get pom property &optional inherit
Get value of @code{PROPERTY} for entry at point-or-marker @code{POM}@.  By default,
this only looks at properties defined locally in the entry.  If @code{INHERIT}
is non-@code{nil} and the entry does not have the property, then also check
higher levels of the hierarchy.  If @code{INHERIT} is the symbol
@code{selective}, use inheritance if and only if the setting of
@code{org-use-property-inheritance} selects @code{PROPERTY} for inheritance.
@end defun

@defun org-entry-delete pom property
Delete the property @code{PROPERTY} from entry at point-or-marker POM.

@defun org-entry-put pom property value
Set @code{PROPERTY} to @code{VALUE} for entry at point-or-marker POM.
@end defun

@defun org-buffer-property-keys &optional include-specials
Get all property keys in the current buffer.
@end defun

@defun org-insert-property-drawer
Insert a property drawer for the current entry.  Also
@end defun

@defun org-entry-put-multivalued-property pom property &rest values
Set @code{PROPERTY} at point-or-marker @code{POM} to @code{VALUES}@.
@code{VALUES} should be a list of strings.  They will be concatenated, with
spaces as separators.
@end defun

@defun org-entry-get-multivalued-property pom property

@defun org-entry-add-to-multivalued-property pom property value
Treat the value of the property @code{PROPERTY} as a whitespace-separated
list of values and make sure that @code{VALUE} is in this list.
@end defun

@defun org-entry-remove-from-multivalued-property pom property value
Treat the value of the property @code{PROPERTY} as a whitespace-separated
list of values and make sure that @code{VALUE} is @emph{not} in this list.

@defopt org-property-allowed-value-functions
Hook for functions supplying allowed values for a specific property.
The functions must take a single argument, the name of the property, and
return a flat list of allowed values.  If @samp{:ETC} is one of
the values, use the values as completion help, but allow also other values
to be entered.  The functions must return @code{nil} if they are not
responsible for this property.
@end defopt

@node Using the mapping API,  , Using the property API, Hacking
@section Using the mapping API
@cindex API, for mapping
@cindex mapping entries, API

Org has sophisticated mapping capabilities to find all entries satisfying
certain criteria.  Internally, this functionality is used to produce agenda
views, but there is also an API that can be used to execute arbitrary
functions for each or selected entries.  The main entry point for this API
is:

@defun org-map-entries func &optional match scope &rest skip
Call @code{FUNC} at each headline selected by @code{MATCH} in @code{SCOPE}.

@code{FUNC} is a function or a Lisp form.  The function will be called
without arguments, with the cursor positioned at the beginning of the
headline.  The return values of all calls to the function will be collected
and returned as a list.

The call to @code{FUNC} will be wrapped into a save-excursion form, so
@code{FUNC} does not need to preserve point.  After evaluation, the cursor
will be moved to the end of the line (presumably of the headline of the
processed entry) and search continues from there.  Under some circumstances,
this may not produce the wanted results.  For example, if you have removed
(e.g., archived) the current (sub)tree it could mean that the next entry will
be skipped entirely.  In such cases, you can specify the position from where
search should continue by making @code{FUNC} set the variable
@code{org-map-continue-from} to the desired buffer position.

@code{MATCH} is a tags/property/todo match as it is used in the agenda match
view.  Only headlines that are matched by this query will be considered
during the iteration.  When @code{MATCH} is @code{nil} or @code{t}, all
headlines will be visited by the iteration.

@code{SCOPE} determines the scope of this command.  It can be any of:

@example
nil     @r{the current buffer, respecting the restriction if any}
tree    @r{the subtree started with the entry at point}
region  @r{The entries within the active region, if any}
file    @r{the current buffer, without restriction}
file-with-archives
        @r{the current buffer, and any archives associated with it}
agenda  @r{all agenda files}
agenda-with-archives
        @r{all agenda files with any archive files associated with them}
(file1 file2 ...)
        @r{if this is a list, all files in the list will be scanned}
@end example
@noindent
The remaining args are treated as settings for the skipping facilities of
the scanner.  The following items can be given here:

@vindex org-agenda-skip-function
@example
archive   @r{skip trees with the archive tag}
comment   @r{skip trees with the COMMENT keyword}
function or Lisp form
          @r{will be used as value for @code{org-agenda-skip-function},}
          @r{so whenever the function returns t, FUNC}
          @r{will not be called for that entry and search will}
          @r{continue from the point where the function leaves it}
@end example
@end defun

The function given to that mapping routine can really do anything you like.
It can use the property API (@pxref{Using the property API}) to gather more
information about the entry, or in order to change metadata in the entry.
Here are a couple of functions that might be handy:

@defun org-todo &optional arg
Change the TODO state of the entry.  See the docstring of the functions for
the many possible values for the argument @code{ARG}.
@end defun

@defun org-priority &optional action
Change the priority of the entry.  See the docstring of this function for the
possible values for @code{ACTION}.
@end defun

@defun org-toggle-tag tag &optional onoff
Toggle the tag @code{TAG} in the current entry.  Setting @code{ONOFF} to
either @code{on} or @code{off} will not toggle tag, but ensure that it is
either on or off.
@end defun

@defun org-promote
Promote the current entry.
@end defun

@defun org-demote
Demote the current entry.
@end defun

Here is a simple example that will turn all entries in the current file with
a tag @code{TOMORROW} into TODO entries with the keyword @code{UPCOMING}.
Entries in comment trees and in archive trees will be ignored.

@lisp
(org-map-entries
 '(org-todo "UPCOMING")
 "+TOMORROW" 'file 'archive 'comment)
@end lisp

The following example counts the number of entries with TODO keyword
@code{WAITING}, in all agenda files.

@lisp
(length (org-map-entries t "/+WAITING" 'agenda))
@end lisp

@appendix MobileOrg

@cindex MobileOrg

@i{MobileOrg} is the name of the mobile companion app for Org mode, currently
available for iOS and for Android.  @i{MobileOrg} offers offline viewing and
capture support for an Org mode system rooted on a ``real'' computer.  It
does also allow you to record changes to existing entries.  The
@uref{https://github.com/MobileOrg/, iOS implementation} for the
@i{iPhone/iPod Touch/iPad} series of devices, was started by Richard Moreland
and is now in the hands Sean Escriva.  Android users should check out
@uref{http://wiki.github.com/matburt/mobileorg-android/, MobileOrg Android}
by Matt Jones.  The two implementations are not identical but offer similar
features.

This appendix describes the support Org has for creating agenda views in a
format that can be displayed by @i{MobileOrg}, and for integrating notes
captured and changes made by @i{MobileOrg} into the main system.

For changing tags and TODO states in MobileOrg, you should have set up the
customization variables @code{org-todo-keywords} and @code{org-tag-alist} to
cover all important tags and TODO keywords, even if individual files use only
part of these.  MobileOrg will also offer you states and tags set up with
in-buffer settings, but it will understand the logistics of TODO state
@i{sets} (@pxref{Per-file keywords}) and @i{mutually exclusive} tags
(@pxref{Setting tags}) only for those set in these variables.

@section Setting up the staging area

MobileOrg needs to interact with Emacs through a directory on a server.  If you
are using a public server, you should consider to encrypt the files that are
uploaded to the server.  This can be done with Org mode 7.02 and with
@i{MobileOrg 1.5} (iPhone version), and you need an @file{openssl}
installation on your system.  To turn on encryption, set a password in
@i{MobileOrg} and, on the Emacs side, configure the variable
@code{org-mobile-use-encryption}@footnote{If you can safely store the
password in your Emacs setup, you might also want to configure
@code{org-mobile-encryption-password}.  Please read the docstring of that
variable.  Note that encryption will apply only to the contents of the
@file{.org} files.  The file names themselves will remain visible.}.

The easiest way to create that directory is to use a free
@uref{http://dropbox.com,Dropbox.com} account@footnote{If you cannot use
Dropbox, or if your version of MobileOrg does not support it, you can use a
webdav server.  For more information, check out the documentation of MobileOrg and also this
@uref{http://orgmode.org/worg/org-faq.html#mobileorg_webdav, FAQ entry}.}.
When MobileOrg first connects to your Dropbox, it will create a directory
@i{MobileOrg} inside the Dropbox.  After the directory has been created, tell
Emacs about it:

@lisp
(setq org-mobile-directory "~/Dropbox/MobileOrg")
@end lisp

Org mode has commands to put files for @i{MobileOrg} into that directory,
and to read captured notes from there.

@node Pushing to MobileOrg, Pulling from MobileOrg, Setting up the staging area, MobileOrg
@section Pushing to MobileOrg

This operation copies all files currently listed in @code{org-mobile-files}
to the directory @code{org-mobile-directory}.  By default this list contains
all agenda files (as listed in @code{org-agenda-files}), but additional files
can be included by customizing @code{org-mobile-files}.  File names will be
staged with paths relative to @code{org-directory}, so all files should be
inside this directory@footnote{Symbolic links in @code{org-directory} need to
have the same name than their targets.}.

The push operation also creates a special Org file @file{agendas.org} with
all custom agenda view defined by the user@footnote{While creating the
agendas, Org mode will force ID properties on all referenced entries, so that
these entries can be uniquely identified if @i{MobileOrg} flags them for
further action.  If you do not want to get these properties in so many
entries, you can set the variable @code{org-mobile-force-id-on-agenda-items}
to @code{nil}.  Org mode will then rely on outline paths, in the hope that
these will be unique enough.}.

Finally, Org writes the file @file{index.org}, containing links to all other
files.  @i{MobileOrg} first reads this file from the server, and then
downloads all agendas and Org files listed in it.  To speed up the download,
MobileOrg will only read files whose checksums@footnote{Checksums are stored
automatically in the file @file{checksums.dat}} have changed.

@node Pulling from MobileOrg,  , Pushing to MobileOrg, MobileOrg
@section Pulling from MobileOrg

When @i{MobileOrg} synchronizes with the server, it not only pulls the Org
files for viewing.  It also appends captured entries and pointers to flagged
and changed entries to the file @file{mobileorg.org} on the server.  Org has
a @emph{pull} operation that integrates this information into an inbox file
and operates on the pointers to flagged entries.  Here is how it works:

@enumerate
@item
Org moves all entries found in
@file{mobileorg.org}@footnote{@file{mobileorg.org} will be empty after this
operation.} and appends them to the file pointed to by the variable
@code{org-mobile-inbox-for-pull}.  Each captured entry and each editing event
will be a top-level entry in the inbox file.
@item
After moving the entries, Org will attempt to implement the changes made in
@i{MobileOrg}.  Some changes are applied directly and without user
interaction.  Examples are all changes to tags, TODO state, headline and body
text that can be cleanly applied.  Entries that have been flagged for further
action will receive a tag @code{:FLAGGED:}, so that they can be easily found
again.  When there is a problem finding an entry or applying the change, the
pointer entry will remain in the inbox and will be marked with an error
message.  You need to later resolve these issues by hand.
@item
Org will then generate an agenda view with all flagged entries.  The user
should then go through these entries and do whatever actions are necessary.
If a note has been stored while flagging an entry in @i{MobileOrg}, that note
will be displayed in the echo area when the cursor is on the corresponding
agenda line.

@table @kbd
@kindex ?
@item ?
Pressing @kbd{?} in that special agenda will display the full flagging note in
another window and also push it onto the kill ring.  So you could use @kbd{?
z C-y C-c C-c} to store that flagging note as a normal note in the entry.
Pressing @kbd{?} twice in succession will offer to remove the
@code{:FLAGGED:} tag along with the recorded flagging note (which is stored
in a property).  In this way you indicate that the intended processing for
this flagged entry is finished.
@end table
@end enumerate

@kindex C-c a ?
If you are not able to process all flagged entries directly, you can always
return to this agenda view@footnote{Note, however, that there is a subtle
difference.  The view created automatically by @kbd{M-x org-mobile-pull RET}
is guaranteed to search all files that have been addressed by the last pull.
This might include a file that is not currently in your list of agenda files.
If you later use @kbd{C-c a ?} to regenerate the view, only the current
agenda files will be searched.} using @kbd{C-c a ?}.

@section From Carsten

Org was born in 2003, out of frustration over the user interface of the Emacs
Outline mode.  I was trying to organize my notes and projects, and using
Emacs seemed to be the natural way to go.  However, having to remember eleven
different commands with two or three keys per command, only to hide and show
parts of the outline tree, that seemed entirely unacceptable to me.  Also,
when using outlines to take notes, I constantly wanted to restructure the
tree, organizing it parallel to my thoughts and plans.  @emph{Visibility
cycling} and @emph{structure editing} were originally implemented in the
package @file{outline-magic.el}, but quickly moved to the more general
@file{org.el}.  As this environment became comfortable for project planning,
the next step was adding @emph{TODO entries}, basic @emph{timestamps}, and
@emph{table support}.  These areas highlighted the two main goals that Org
still has today: to be a new, outline-based, plain text mode with innovative
and intuitive editing features, and to incorporate project planning
functionality directly into a notes file.

Since the first release, literally thousands of emails to me or to
@email{emacs-orgmode@@gnu.org} have provided a constant stream of bug
reports, feedback, new ideas, and sometimes patches and add-on code.
Many thanks to everyone who has helped to improve this package.  I am
trying to keep here a list of the people who had significant influence
in shaping one or more aspects of Org.  The list may not be
complete, if I have forgotten someone, please accept my apologies and
let me know.

Before I get to this list, a few special mentions are in order:

@table @i
@item Bastien Guerry
Bastien has written a large number of extensions to Org (most of them
integrated into the core by now), including the @LaTeX{} exporter and the plain
list parser.  His support during the early days, when he basically acted as
co-maintainer, was central to the success of this project.  Bastien also
invented Worg, helped establishing the Web presence of Org, and sponsored
hosting costs for the orgmode.org website.
@item Eric Schulte and Dan Davison
Eric and Dan are jointly responsible for the Org-babel system, which turns
Org into a multi-language environment for evaluating code and doing literate
programming and reproducible research.
@item John Wiegley
John has contributed a number of great ideas and patches directly to Org,
including the attachment system (@file{org-attach.el}), integration with
Apple Mail (@file{org-mac-message.el}), hierarchical dependencies of TODO
items, habit tracking (@file{org-habits.el}), and encryption
(@file{org-crypt.el}).  Also, the capture system is really an extended copy
of his great @file{remember.el}.
@item Sebastian Rose
Without Sebastian, the HTML/XHTML publishing of Org would be the pitiful work
of an ignorant amateur.  Sebastian has pushed this part of Org onto a much
higher level.  He also wrote @file{org-info.js}, a Java script for displaying
web pages derived from Org using an Info-like or a folding interface with
single-key navigation.
@end table

@noindent See below for the full list of contributions!  Again, please
let me know what I am missing here!

@section From Bastien

I (Bastien) have been maintaining Org since January 2011.  This appendix
would not be complete without adding a few more acknowledgements and thanks
to Carsten's ones above.

I am first grateful to Carsten for his trust while handing me over the
maintainership of Org.  His unremitting support is what really helped me
getting more confident over time, with both the community and the code.

When I took over maintainership, I knew I would have to make Org more
collaborative than ever, as I would have to rely on people that are more
knowledgeable than I am on many parts of the code.  Here is a list of the
persons I could rely on, they should really be considered co-maintainers,
either of the code or the community:

@table @i
@item Eric Schulte
Eric is maintaining the Babel parts of Org.  His reactivity here kept me away
from worrying about possible bugs here and let me focus on other parts.

@item Nicolas Goaziou
Nicolas is maintaining the consistency of the deepest parts of Org.  His
work on @file{org-element.el} and @file{ox.el} has been outstanding, and
opened the doors for many new ideas and features.  He rewrote many of the
old exporters to use the new export engine, and helped with documenting
this major change.  More importantly (if that's possible), he has been more
than reliable during all the work done for Org 8.0, and always very
reactive on the mailing list.

@item Achim Gratz
Achim rewrote the building process of Org, turning some @emph{ad hoc} tools
into a flexible and conceptually clean process.  He patiently coped with the
many hiccups that such a change can create for users.

@item Nick Dokos
The Org mode mailing list would not be such a nice place without Nick, who
patiently helped users so many times.  It is impossible to overestimate such
a great help, and the list would not be so active without him.
@end table

I received support from so many users that it is clearly impossible to be
fair when shortlisting a few of them, but Org's history would not be
complete if the ones above were not mentioned in this manual.
