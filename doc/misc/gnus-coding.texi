@c Obviously this is only a very rudimentary draft.  We put it in the
@c repository anyway hoping that it might annoy someone enough to fix
@c it.  ;-) Fixing only a paragraph also is appreciated.

@section Dependencies

The Gnus distribution contains a lot of libraries that have been written
for Gnus and used intensively for Gnus.  But many of those libraries are
useful on their own.  E.g., other Emacs Lisp packages might use the
@acronym{MIME} library @xref{Top, ,Top, emacs-mime, The Emacs MIME
Manual}.

@subsection General purpose libraries

@table @file

@item netrc.el
@file{.netrc} parsing functionality.

HZ (rfc1843) decoding.  HZ is a data format for exchanging files of
arbitrarily mixed Chinese and @acronym{ASCII} characters.
@c As of 2005-10-21...
@code{rfc1843-gnus-setup} seem to be useful only for Gnus.  Maybe this
function should be relocated to remove dependencies on Gnus.  Other
minor dependencies: @code{gnus-newsgroup-name} could be eliminated by
using an optional argument to @code{rfc1843-decode-article-body}.

@item rfc2045.el

@c major news providers (e.g., news.individual.org) started to use it.
@c As of 2007-08-25...
There are no Gnus dependencies in these files.

@subsection message

All message composition from Gnus (both mail and news) takes place in
Message mode buffers.  Message mode is intended to be a replacement for
Emacs mail mode.  There should be no Gnus dependencies in
@file{message.el}.  Alas it is not anymore.  Patches and suggestions to
remove the dependencies are welcome.

@c message.el requires nnheader which requires gnus-util.

@subsection Emacs @acronym{MIME}

The files @file{mml*.el} and @file{mm-*.el} provide @acronym{MIME}
functionality for Emacs.

@acronym{MML} (@acronym{MIME} Meta Language) is supposed to be
independent from Gnus.  Alas it is not anymore.  Patches and suggestions
to remove the dependencies are welcome.

@subsection Gnus backends

The files @file{nn*.el} provide functionality for accessing NNTP
(@file{nntp.el}), IMAP (@file{nnimap.el}) and several other Mail back
ends (probably @file{nnml.el}, @file{nnfolder.el} and
@file{nnmaildir.el} are the most widely used mail back ends).

@c mm-uu requires nnheader which requires gnus-util.  message.el also
@c requires nnheader.
