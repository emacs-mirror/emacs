@top The GNU Emacs FAQ

This is the GNU Emacs FAQ.

This FAQ is maintained as a part of GNU Emacs.  If you find any errors,
or have any suggestions, please use @kbd{M-x report-emacs-bug} to report
them.

This is the version of the FAQ distributed with Emacs @value{EMACSVER}, and
mainly describes that version.  Although there is some information on
older versions, details about very old releases (now only of historical
interest) have been removed.  If you are interested in this, consult
either the version of the FAQ distributed with older versions of Emacs,
or the history of this document in the Emacs source repository.

Since Emacs releases are very stable, we recommend always running the
latest release.

This FAQ is not updated very frequently.  When you have a question about
Emacs, the Emacs manual is often the best starting point.

(if your computer doesn't have a @key{Meta} key, @pxref{No Meta key})

@item

deleting invokes Emacs help)

@item
@key{ESC}: Escape; same as @kbd{C-[}

@item
@key{TAB}: Tab; same as @kbd{C-i}

@item
@key{SPC}: Space bar

@end itemize

Key sequences longer than one key (and some single-key sequences) are
written inside quotes or on lines by themselves, like this:

@display
  @kbd{M-x frobnicate-while-foo @key{RET}}
@end display

@noindent
Any real spaces in such a key sequence should be ignored; only @key{SPC}
really means press the space key.

The @acronym{ASCII} code sent by @kbd{C-x} (except for @kbd{C-?}) is the value
that would be sent by pressing just @kbd{x} minus 96 (or 64 for
upper-case @kbd{X}) and will be from 0 to 31.  On Unix and GNU/Linux
terminals, the @acronym{ASCII} code sent by @kbd{M-x} is the sum of 128 and the
@acronym{ASCII} code that would be sent by pressing just @kbd{x}.  Essentially,
@key{Control} turns off bits 5 and 6 and @key{Meta} turns on bit
7@footnote{
DOS and Windows terminals don't set bit 7 when the @key{Meta} key is
pressed.}.

@kbd{C-?} (aka @key{DEL}) is @acronym{ASCII} code 127.  It is a misnomer to call
@kbd{C-?}  a ``control'' key, since 127 has both bits 5 and 6 turned ON@.
Also, on very few keyboards does @kbd{C-?} generate @acronym{ASCII} code 127.
@c FIXME I cannot understand the previous sentence.

@kbd{M-x @var{command}} means type @kbd{M-x}, then type the name of the
command, then type @key{RET}.  (@xref{Basic keys}, if you're not sure
what @kbd{M-x} and @key{RET} mean.)

@kbd{M-x} (by default) invokes the command
@code{execute-extended-command}.  This command allows you to run any
Emacs command if you can remember the command's name.  If you can't
remember the command's name, you can type @key{TAB} and @key{SPC} for
completion, @kbd{?} for a list of possibilities, and @kbd{M-p} and
@kbd{M-n} (or up-arrow and down-arrow) to see previous commands entered.
An Emacs @dfn{command} is an @dfn{interactive} Emacs function.

@cindex @key{Do} key
Your system administrator may have bound other key sequences to invoke
@code{execute-extended-command}.  A function key labeled @kbd{Do} is a
good candidate for this, on keyboards that have such a key.

If you need to run non-interactive Emacs functions, see @ref{Evaluating
Emacs Lisp code}.

@cindex Reading topics in the Emacs manual
@cindex Finding topics in the Emacs manual
@cindex Info, finding topics in

When we refer you to some @var{topic} in the Emacs manual, you can
read this manual node inside Emacs (assuming nothing is broken) by
typing @kbd{C-h i m emacs @key{RET} m @var{topic} @key{RET}}.

This invokes Info, the GNU hypertext documentation browser.  If you don't
already know how to use Info, type @kbd{?} from within Info.

If we refer to @var{topic}:@var{subtopic}, type @kbd{C-h i m emacs
@key{RET} m @var{topic} @key{RET} m @var{subtopic} @key{RET}}.

If these commands don't work as expected, your system administrator may
not have installed the Info files, or may have installed them
improperly.  In this case you should complain.

If you are reading this FAQ in Info, you can simply press @key{RET} on a
reference to follow it.

@node File-name conventions
@section What are @file{src/config.h}, @file{site-lisp/default.el}, etc.?
@cindex File-name conventions
@cindex Conventions for file names
@cindex Directories and files that come with Emacs

These are files that come with Emacs.  The Emacs distribution is divided
into subdirectories; e.g., @file{etc}, @file{lisp}, and @file{src}.
Some of these (e.g., @file{etc} and @file{lisp}) are present both in
an installed Emacs and in the sources, but some (e.g., @file{src}) are
only found in the sources.

If you use Emacs, but don't know where it is kept on your system, start
Emacs, then type @kbd{C-h v data-directory @key{RET}}.  The directory
name displayed by this will be the full pathname of the installed
@file{etc} directory.  (This full path is recorded in the Emacs variable
@code{data-directory}, and @kbd{C-h v} displays the value and the
documentation of a variable.)

The location of your Info directory (i.e., where Info documentation
is stored) is kept in the variable @code{Info-default-directory-list}.  Use
@kbd{C-h v Info-default-directory-list @key{RET}} to see the value of
this variable, which will be a list of directory names.  The last
directory in that list is probably where most Info files are stored.  By
default, Emacs Info documentation is placed in @file{/usr/local/share/info}.

For information on some of the files in the @file{etc} directory,

The word ``free'' in the title of the Free Software Foundation refers to
``freedom,'' not ``zero cost.''  Anyone can charge any price for
GPL-covered software that they want to.  However, in practice, the
freedom enforced by the GPL leads to low prices, because you can always
get the software for less money from someone else, since everyone has
the right to resell or give away GPL-covered software.

@cindex Discussion of the GPL

The real legal meaning of the GNU General Public License (copyleft) will
only be known if and when a judge rules on its validity and scope.
There has never been a copyright infringement case involving the GPL to
set any precedents.  Although legal actions have been brought against
companies for violating the terms of the GPL, so far all have been
settled out of court (in favor of the plaintiffs).  Please take any
discussion regarding this issue to
@uref{https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/gnu-misc-discuss, the
gnu-misc-discuss mailing list}, which was created to hold the
extensive flame wars on the subject.

RMS writes:

@quotation
The legal meaning of the GNU copyleft is less important than the spirit,
which is that Emacs is a free software project and that work pertaining
to Emacs should also be free software.  ``Free'' means that all users
have the freedom to study, share, change and improve Emacs.  To make
sure everyone has this freedom, pass along source code when you
distribute any version of Emacs or a related program, and give the
recipients the same freedom that you enjoyed.

@cindex GNU newsgroups, appropriate messages for
@cindex GNU mailing lists, appropriate messages for

@cindex Posting messages to mailing lists

@cindex GNU mailing lists
The Emacs mailing lists are described at
@uref{https://savannah.gnu.org/mail/?group=emacs, the Emacs Savannah
page}.

Messages advocating ``non-free'' software are considered unacceptable
on any of the GNU mailing lists, except for
@url{https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/gnu-misc-discuss, the
gnu-misc-discuss mailing list} which was created to hold the extensive
flame-wars on the subject.

``Non-free'' software includes any software for which the end user
can't freely modify the source code and exchange enhancements.  Be
careful to remove any GNU mailing lists from @samp{Cc:} when posting a
reply that recommends such software.

@url{https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/bug-gnu-emacs, The
bug-gnu-emacs list} is a place where bug reports appear, but we
recommend using the commands @kbd{M-x report-emacs-bug} or @kbd{M-x
submit-emacs-patch} if at all possible (@pxref{Reporting bugs}).

Some GNU mailing lists are gatewayed to (Usenet) newsgroups.
For example, sending an email to
@url{https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/bug-gnu-emacs, The
bug-gnu-emacs list} has the effect of posting on the newsgroup
@uref{news:gnu.emacs.help}).

Finally, we recommend reading the
@url{https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/kind-communication.html, GNU Kind
Communications Guidelines} before posting to any GNU lists or
newsgroups.

@cindex Archived postings from @code{help-gnu-emacs}
@cindex Old mailing list posts for GNU lists
@cindex Mailing list archives for GNU lists

The FSF has maintained archives of all of the GNU mailing lists for many
years, although there may be some unintentional gaps in coverage.  The
archive can be browsed over the web at
@uref{https://lists.gnu.org/r/, the GNU mail archive}.

Some web-based Usenet search services also archive the @code{gnu.*}
newsgroups.

@node Reporting bugs
@section Where should I report bugs and other problems with Emacs?
@cindex Bug reporting
@cindex Good bug reports
@cindex How to submit a bug report
@cindex Reporting bugs

The correct way to report Emacs bugs is to use the command
@kbd{M-x report-emacs-bug}.  It sets up a mail buffer with the
essential information and the correct e-mail address,
@email{bug-gnu-emacs@@gnu.org}.

Be sure to read the ``Bugs'' section of the Emacs manual before reporting
a bug!  The manual describes in detail how to submit a useful bug
report (@pxref{Bugs, , Reporting Bugs, emacs, The GNU Emacs Manual}).
(@xref{Emacs manual}, if you don't know how to read the manual.)

Sending bug reports to
@url{https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/help-gnu-emacs, the
help-gnu-emacs mailing list} is undesirable because it takes the time
of an unnecessarily large group of people, most of whom are just users
and have no idea how to fix these
problem.  @url{https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/bug-gnu-emacs,
The bug-gnu-emacs list} reaches a much smaller group of people who are
more likely to know what to do and have expressed a wish to receive
more messages about Emacs than the others.

If you have reported a bug and you don't hear about a possible fix,
then after a suitable delay (such as a week) it is okay to post on
@code{help-gnu-emacs@@gnu.org} asking if anyone can help you.

If you are unsure whether you have found a bug, consider the following
non-exhaustive list, courtesy of RMS:

@quotation
If Emacs crashes, that is a bug.  If Emacs gets compilation errors
while building, that is a bug.  If Emacs crashes while building, that
is a bug.  If Lisp code does not do what the documentation says it
does, that is a bug.
@end quotation

Anything sent to @email{bug-gnu-emacs@@gnu.org} also appears in the
newsgroup @uref{news:gnu.emacs.bug}, but please use e-mail instead of
news to submit the bug report.  This ensures a reliable return address
so you can be contacted for further details.

@node Unsubscribing from Emacs lists
@section  How do I unsubscribe from a mailing list?
@cindex Unsubscribing from GNU mailing lists
@cindex Removing yourself from GNU mailing lists

If you are receiving a GNU mailing list named @var{list}, you should be
able to unsubscribe from it by sending a request to the address
@email{@var{list}-request@@gnu.org}.  Mailing lists mails normally
contain information in either the message header
(@samp{List-Unsubscribe:}) or as a footer that tells you how to

foreign languages such as French, German, Japanese, Russian, etc.  Use
@kbd{M-x help-with-tutorial-spec-language @key{RET}} to choose your
language and start the tutorial.

Your system administrator may have changed @kbd{C-h} to act like
@key{DEL} to deal with local keyboards.  You can use @kbd{M-x
help-for-help} instead to invoke help.  To discover what key (if any)
invokes help on your system, type @kbd{M-x where-is @key{RET}
help-for-help @key{RET}}.  This will print a comma-separated list of key
sequences in the echo area.  Ignore the last character in each key
sequence listed.  Each of the resulting key sequences (e.g., @key{F1} is
common) invokes help.

Emacs help works best if it is invoked by a single key whose value
should be stored in the variable @code{help-char}.

topic, the command, or the variable which you are looking for.  If this
does not land you on the right place in the manual, press @kbd{,}
(comma) repeatedly until you find what you need.  (The @kbd{i} and
@kbd{,} keys invoke the index-searching functions, which look for the
@var{topic} you type in all the indices of the Emacs manual.)

@cindex Apropos
@item
You can list all of the commands whose names contain a certain word
(actually which match a regular expression) using @kbd{C-h a} (@kbd{M-x
command-apropos}).

@cindex Command description in the manual
@item
The command @kbd{C-h F} (@code{Info-goto-emacs-command-node}) prompts
for the name of a command, and then attempts to find the section in the
Emacs manual where that command is described.

@cindex Finding commands and variables

@cindex Reference cards, in other languages
@item
You can get a printed reference card listing commands and keys to
invoke them.  You can order one from the FSF for $2 (or 10 for $18),
or you can print your own from the @file{etc/refcards/refcard.tex} or
@file{etc/refcards/refcard.pdf} files in the Emacs distribution.
The Emacs distribution comes with translations of the reference card
into several languages; look for files named
@file{etc/refcards/@var{lang}-refcard.*}, where @var{lang} is a
two-letter code of the language.  For example, the German version of
the reference card is in the files @file{etc/refcards/de-refcard.tex}
and @file{etc/refcards/de-refcard.pdf}.

@cindex Texinfo documentation, installing
@cindex Installing Texinfo documentation
@cindex New Texinfo files, installing
@cindex Documentation, installing new Texinfo files
@cindex Info files, how to install

Emacs releases come with pre-built Info files, and the normal install
process places them in the correct location.  This is true for most
applications that provide Info files.  The following section is only
relevant if you want to install extra Info files by hand.

First, you must turn the Texinfo source files into Info files.  You may
do this using the stand-alone @file{makeinfo} program, available as part
of the Texinfo package at

@uref{https://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo/}

For information about the Texinfo format, read the Texinfo manual which
comes with the Texinfo package.  This manual also comes installed in
Info format, so you can read it from Emacs; type @kbd{C-h i m texinfo
@key{RET}}.

@c FIXME is this a complete alternative?
@c Probably not, given that we require makeinfo to build Emacs.
Alternatively, you could use the Emacs command @kbd{M-x
texinfo-format-buffer}, after visiting the Texinfo source file of the
manual you want to convert.

Neither @code{texinfo-format-buffer} nor @file{makeinfo} installs the
resulting Info files in Emacs's Info tree.  To install Info files,
perform these steps:

@enumerate
@item
Move the files to the @file{info} directory in the installed Emacs
distribution.  @xref{File-name conventions}, if you don't know where that
is.

@item
Run the @code{install-info} command, which is part of the Texinfo
distribution, to update the main Info directory menu, like this:

@example
 install-info --info-dir=@var{dir-path} @var{dir-path}/@var{file}
@end example

@noindent
where @var{dir-path} is the full path to the directory where you copied
the produced Info file(s), and @var{file} is the name of the Info file
you produced and want to install.

If you don't have the @code{install-info} command installed, you can
edit the file @file{info/dir} in the installed Emacs distribution, and
add a line for the top level node in the Info package that you are
installing.  Follow the examples already in this file.  The format is:

@example
* Topic: (relative-pathname).  Short description of topic.
@end example

@end enumerate

If you want to install Info files and you don't have the necessary
privileges, you have several options:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Info files don't actually need to be installed before being used.
You can use a prefix argument for the @code{info} command and specify
the name of the Info file in the minibuffer.  This goes to the node
named @samp{Top} in that file.  For example, to view an Info file named
@file{@var{info-file}} in your home directory, you can type this:

@example
@kbd{C-u C-h i ~/@var{info-file} @key{RET}}
@end example

Alternatively, you can feed a file name to the @code{Info-goto-node}
command (invoked by pressing @kbd{g} in Info mode) by typing the name

@example

@item
You can create your own Info directory.  You can tell Emacs where that
Info directory is by adding its pathname to the value of the variable
@code{Info-default-directory-list}.  For example, to use a private Info
directory which is a subdirectory of your home directory named @file{Info},
you could put this in your @file{.emacs} file:

@lisp
(add-to-list 'Info-default-directory-list "~/Info")
@end lisp

You will need a top-level Info file named @file{dir} in this directory
which has everything the system @file{dir} file has in it, except it
should list only entries for Info files in that directory.  You might
not need it if (fortuitously) all files in this directory were
referenced by other @file{dir} files.  The node lists from all
@file{dir} files in @code{Info-default-directory-list} are merged by the
Info system.

@cindex Printing a Texinfo file
@cindex Texinfo file, printing
@cindex Printing documentation

You can't get nicely printed output from Info files; you must still have
the original Texinfo source file for the manual you want to print.

Assuming you have @TeX{} installed on your system, follow these steps:

@enumerate

@item
Make sure the first line of the Texinfo file looks like this:

@example
\input texinfo
@end example

You may need to change @samp{texinfo} to the full pathname of the
@file{texinfo.tex} file, which comes with Emacs as
@file{doc/misc/texinfo.tex} (or copy or link it into the current directory).

@item
Type @kbd{texi2dvi @var{texinfo-source}}, where @var{texinfo-source} is
the name of the Texinfo source file for which you want to produce a
printed copy.  The @samp{texi2dvi} script is part of the GNU Texinfo
distribution.

Alternatively, @samp{texi2pdf} produces PDF files.

@item
Print the DVI file @file{@var{texinfo-source}.dvi} in the normal way for
printing DVI files at your site.  For example, if you have a PostScript
printer, run the @code{dvips} program to print the DVI file on that
printer.

@node Origin of the term Emacs
@section Where does the name ``Emacs'' come from?
@cindex Origin of the term ``Emacs''
@cindex Emacs name origin
@cindex TECO
@cindex Original version of Emacs

Emacs originally was an acronym for Editor MACroS@.  RMS says he ``picked
the name Emacs because @kbd{E} was not in use as an abbreviation on ITS at
the time.''  The first Emacs was a set of macros written in 1976 at MIT
by RMS for the editor TECO (Text Editor and COrrector, originally Tape
Editor and COrrector) under ITS (the Incompatible Timesharing System) on
a PDP-10.  RMS had already extended TECO with a ``real-time''
full-screen mode with reprogrammable keys.  Emacs was started by
@c gls@@east.sun.com
Guy Steele as a project to unify the many
divergent TECO command sets and key bindings at MIT, and completed by
RMS.

Many people have said that TECO code looks a lot like line noise; you
can read more at @uref{news:alt.lang.teco}.  Someone has written a TECO
implementation in Emacs Lisp (to find it, see @ref{Packages that do not
come with Emacs}); it would be an interesting project to run the
original TECO Emacs inside of Emacs.

@cindex Why Emacs?

@cindex Version, latest
@cindex Latest version of Emacs
@cindex Development, Emacs
@cindex Repository, Emacs
@cindex Bazaar repository, Emacs

Emacs @value{EMACSVER} is the current version as of this writing.  A version
number with two components (e.g., @samp{24.5}) indicates a released
version; three components indicate a development
version (e.g., @samp{28.0.50} is what will eventually become @samp{28.1}).

Emacs is under active development, hosted at
@uref{https://savannah.gnu.org/projects/emacs/, Savannah}.
Follow the instructions given there to clone the project repository.

Because Emacs undergoes many changes before a release, the version
number of a development version is not especially meaningful.  It is
better to refer to the date on which the sources were retrieved from the
development repository.  The development version is usually quite robust
for every-day use, but if stability is more important to you than the
latest features, you may want to stick to the releases.

The following sections list some of the major new features in the last
few Emacs releases.  For full details of the changes in any version of
Emacs, type @kbd{C-h C-n} (@kbd{M-x view-emacs-news}).  You can give
this command a prefix argument to read about which features were new
in older versions.

@node New in Emacs 27
@section What is different about Emacs 27?
@cindex Differences between Emacs 26 and Emacs 27
@cindex Emacs 27, new features in

@itemize
@cindex bignum support
@item
Emacs now uses the GNU Multiple Precision (@acronym{GMP}) library to
support integers whose size is too large to support natively.  The
integers supported natively are known as ``fixnums'', while the larger
ones are ``bignums''.  All the arithmetic, comparison, and logical
(also known as ``bitwise'') operations where bignums make sense now
support both fixnums and bignums.

@cindex HarfBuzz
@item
Emacs now uses HarfBuzz as its default shaping engine.

@cindex JSON, native parsing
@item
Native support for @acronym{JSON} parsing that is much faster than
@file{json.el}.

@item
Cairo drawing is no longer experimental.

@cindex portable dumper
@item
Emacs now uses a ``portable dumper'' instead of unexec.  This improves
compatibility with memory allocation on modern systems, and in
particular better supports the Address Space Layout Randomization
(@acronym{ASLR}) feature, a security technique used by most modern
operating systems.

@cindex XDG convention
@item
Emacs can now use the @acronym{XDG} convention for init files.

@cindex early init file
@item
Emacs can now be configured using an early init file.  The primary
purpose is to allow customizing how the package system is initialized
given that initialization now happens before loading the regular init
file.

@cindex tabs
@item
Built-in support for tabs (tab bar and tab line).

@item
Support for resizing and rotating of images without ImageMagick.
@end itemize

@node New in Emacs 26
@section What is different about Emacs 26?
@cindex Differences between Emacs 25 and Emacs 26
@cindex Emacs 26, new features in

@itemize
@cindex threads
@item
Emacs now provides a limited form of concurrency with Lisp threads.

@cindex systemd support
@item
Emacs now supports @code{systemd}.  The new command-line option
@option{--fg-daemon} is part of this support, it causes Emacs to run
in the foreground instead of forking, as under @option{--daemon}.

@item
Emacs now supports 24-bit true color on text terminals which provide
that feature.  @xref{Colors on a TTY}.

@cindex double-buffering
@item
Emacs on X now supports double-buffering, which eliminates display
flickering in most situations.

@item
You can now scroll the Emacs display horizontally using the mouse or
touchpad.

@cindex line number display
@item
Emacs display now includes an optional feature for display of line
numbers via the @code{display-line-numbers-mode} command.  This
feature is much faster than the equivalent display offered by packages
such as @code{linum}, and also provides many optional features like
relative line numbers.

@cindex horizontal scrolling of current line
@item
The automatic horizontal scrolling of the window display when lines
are truncated can now optionally be enabled only for the current line,
the line where Emacs shows the cursor.  Under this mode, all the other
window lines are not scrolled to show characters outside of the
viewport.

@item
Letter-case conversions now honor special cases in Turkish and Greek
scripts.

@cindex Enchant support
@item
Support for Enchant is now part of the Emacs spell-checking commands.

@item
Tramp now supports Google Drive filesystems.

@item
Emacs can now be built while omitting the details of the machine on
which it was built, thus making it easier to produce reproducible
builds.

@item
Security vulnerability related to Enriched Text mode is removed.
Enriched mode previously allowed saving @code{display} properties as
part of text; those properties support evaluating arbitrary Lisp code,
which opens a vulnerability for Emacs users receiving Enriched Text
from external sources.  Execution of arbitrary Lisp forms in
@code{display} properties decoded by Enriched Text mode is now
disabled by default.

@cindex Unicode 11.0.0
@item
Emacs 26.2 comes with data files imported from the latest Unicode
Standard version 11.0.0.

@itemize
@cindex xwidgets
@item
Emacs can now embed native widgets inside Emacs buffers, if you have
gtk3 and webkitgtk3 installed.  E.g., to access the embedded webkit
browser widget, type @kbd{M-x xwidget-webkit-browse-url}.

@cindex loadable modules
@item
Emacs can now dynamically load external modules compiled as shared
libraries.

@cindex Unicode characters, typing easily
@item
@kbd{C-x 8} has new shorthands for several popular characters, type
@kbd{C-x 8 C-h} to list shorthands.

@cindex automatic display of Lisp APIs
@item
A new minor mode @code{global-eldoc-mode} is enabled by default, and
shows in the echo area or in the mode line the argument list of the
Emacs Lisp form at point.

@cindex pasting text on text terminals
@cindex bracketed paste mode
@item
On text terminals that support the ``bracketed paste mode'' EMacs now
uses that mode by default.  This mode allows Emacs to distinguish
between pasted text and text typed by the user.

@cindex Unicode 9.0.0
@item
Emacs 25 comes with data files imported from the latest Unicode
Standard version 9.0.0.

@cindex bidirectional editing
@item
The support for bidirectional editing was updated to include all the
features mandated by the latest Unicode Standard version 9.0.0.

@cindex character folding in searches
@item
Search command can now perform character folding in matches.  This is
analogous to case folding, but instead of disregarding case variants,
it disregards wider classes of distinctions between similar
characters, such as matching different variants of double quote
characters, ignoring diacritics, etc.

@cindex eww
@item
The Emacs Web Browser EWW was extended to render text using
variable-pitch fonts, and got other new features.

@cindex rmail, and HTML mails
@item
Rmail can now render HTML mail messages, if Emacs is built with
libxml2 or if you have the Lynx browser installed.

@cindex support for push commands in VC
@item
VC now has basic support for @code{push} commands, implemented for
Bzr, Git, and Hg.

@cindex hide-ifdef, C/C@t{++} expressions in macros
@item
Hide-IfDef mode now support full C/C@t{++} expressions in macros,
macro argument expansion, interactive macro evaluation and automatic
scanning of @code{#define}d symbols.

@cindex xref
@item
New package Xref replaces Etags's front-end and UI@.  Xref provides a
generic framework and new commands to find and move to definitions of
functions, macros, data structures etc., as well as go back to the
location where you were before moving to a definition.  It supersedes
and obsoletes many Etags commands, while still using the etags.el code
that reads the TAGS tables as one of its back-ends.  As result, the
popular key bindings @kbd{M-.} and @kbd{M-,} have been changed to
invoke Xref commands.

@cindex project
@item
The new package Project provides generic infrastructure for dealing
with projects.

@cindex horizontal scroll bars
@item
Emacs can now draw horizontal scroll bars on some platforms that
provide toolkit scroll bars, namely Gtk+, Lucid, Motif and Windows.

@itemize
@cindex packages, installing more
@item
Emacs now includes a package manager.  Type @kbd{M-x list-packages} to
get started.  You can use this to download and automatically install
many more Lisp packages.

@cindex lexical binding
@item
Emacs Lisp now supports lexical binding on a per-file basis.  In
@emph{lexical binding}, variable references must be located textually
within the binding construct.  This contrasts with @emph{dynamic
binding}, where programs can refer to variables defined outside their
local textual scope.  A Lisp file can use a local variable setting of
@code{lexical-binding: t} to indicate that the contents should be
interpreted using lexical binding.  See the Emacs Lisp Reference
Manual for more details.

@cindex bidirectional display
@cindex right-to-left languages
@item
Some human languages, such as English, are written from left to right.
Others, such as Arabic, are written from right to left.  Emacs now has
support for any mixture of these forms---this is ``bidirectional text''.

@item
Handling of text selections has been improved, and now integrates
better with external clipboards.

@cindex themes
@item
A new command @kbd{customize-themes} allows you to easily change the
appearance of your Emacs.

@item
Emacs can be compiled with the GTK+ 3 toolkit.

@item
Support for several new external libraries can be included at compile
time:

@itemize

@item
``Security-Enhanced Linux'' (SELinux) is a Linux kernel feature that
provides more sophisticated file access controls than ordinary
``Unix-style'' file permissions.

@item
The ImageMagick display library.  This allows you to display many more
image format in Emacs, as well as carry out transformations such as
rotations.

@item
The GnuTLS library for secure network communications.  Emacs uses this
transparently for email if your mail server supports it.

@item
The libxml2 library for parsing XML structures.

@item
Much more flexibility in the handling of windows and buffer display.

@cindex Anti-aliased fonts
@cindex Freetype fonts
@item
Emacs has a new font code that can use multiple font backends,
including freetype and fontconfig.  Emacs can use the Xft library for
anti-aliasing, and the otf and m17n libraries for complex text layout and
text shaping.

@cindex Unicode
@cindex Character sets
@item
The Emacs character set is now a superset of Unicode.  Several new
language environments have been added.

@cindex Multi-tty support
@cindex X and tty displays

Emacs now supports using both X displays and ttys in the same session
(@samp{multi-tty}).

@cindex Daemon mode
@item
Emacs can be started as a daemon in the background.

@cindex NeXTstep port
@cindex GNUstep port
@cindex macOS Cocoa
@item
There is a new NeXTstep port of Emacs.  This supports GNUstep and Mac OS
X (via the Cocoa libraries).  The Carbon port of Emacs, which supported
Mac OS X in Emacs 22, has been removed.

@cindex Directory-local variables
@item
Directory-local variables can now be defined, in a similar manner to
file-local variables.

@item
Transient Mark mode is on by default.

@end itemize

@noindent
Other changes include: support for serial port access; D-Bus bindings; a
new Visual Line mode for line-motion; improved completion; a new mode
(@samp{DocView}) for viewing of PDF, PostScript, and DVI documents; nXML
mode (for editing XML documents) is included; VC has been updated for

@item
The minibuffer prompt is displayed in a distinct face.

@item
Abbrev definitions are read automatically at startup.

@item
Grep mode is separate from Compilation mode and has many new options and
commands specific to grep.

@item
The original Emacs macro system has been replaced by the new Kmacro
package, which provides many new commands and features and a simple
interface that uses the function keys F3 and F4.  Macros are stored in a
macro ring, and can be debugged and edited interactively.

@item
The Grand Unified Debugger (GUD) can be used with a full graphical user
interface to GDB; this provides many features found in traditional
development environments, making it easy to manipulate breakpoints, add
watch points, display the call stack, etc.  Breakpoints are visually
indicated in the source buffer.

@item
@cindex New modes
Many new modes and packages have been included in Emacs, such as Calc,
TRAMP, URL, IDO, CUA, ERC, rcirc, Table, Image-Dired, SES, Ruler, Org,
PGG, Flymake, Password, Printing, Reveal, wdired, t-mouse, longlines,
savehist, Conf mode, Python mode, DNS mode, etc.

@cindex Multilingual Environment

@cindex Emacs 21, new features in

@cindex Variable-size fonts
@cindex Toolbar support
Emacs 21 features a thorough rewrite of the display engine.  The new
display engine supports variable-size fonts, images, and can play sounds
on platforms which support that.  As a result, the visual appearance of
Emacs, when it runs on a windowed display, is much more reminiscent of
modern GUI programs, and includes 3D widgets (used for the mode line and
the scroll bars), a configurable and extensible toolbar, tooltips
(a.k.a.@: balloon help), and other niceties.

@cindex Colors on text-only terminals
@cindex TTY colors
In addition, Emacs 21 supports faces on text-only terminals.  This means
that you can now have colors when you run Emacs on a GNU/Linux console
and on @code{xterm} with @kbd{emacs -nw}.

@cindex Emacs 20, new features in

The differences between Emacs versions 18 and 19 were rather dramatic;
the introduction of frames, faces, and colors on windowing systems was
obvious to even the most casual user.

There are differences between Emacs versions 19 and 20 as well, but many
are more subtle or harder to find.  Among the changes are the inclusion
of MULE code for languages that use non-Latin characters and for mixing
several languages in the same document; the ``Customize'' facility for
modifying variables without having to use Lisp; and automatic conversion
of files from Macintosh, Microsoft, and Unix platforms.

@xref{Init File,,, emacs, The GNU Emacs Manual}.

In general, new Emacs users should not be provided with @file{.emacs}
files, because this can cause confusing non-standard behavior.  Then
they send questions to
@url{https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/help-gnu-emacs,
the help-gnu-emacs mailing list} asking why Emacs
isn't behaving as documented.

Emacs includes the Customize facility (@pxref{Using Customize}).  This
allows users who are unfamiliar with Emacs Lisp to modify their
@file{.emacs} files in a relatively straightforward way, using menus
rather than Lisp code.

While Customize might indeed make it easier to configure Emacs,
consider taking a bit of time to learn Emacs Lisp and modifying your
@file{.emacs} directly.  Simple configuration options are described
rather completely in @ref{Init File,,, emacs, The GNU Emacs Manual},
for users interested in performing frequently requested, basic tasks.

Sometimes users are unsure as to where their @file{.emacs} file should
be found.  Visiting the file as @file{~/.emacs} from Emacs will find
the correct file.

@xref{Easy Customization,,, emacs, The GNU Emacs Manual}.

If you know the name of the group in advance (e.g., ``shell''), use
@kbd{M-x customize-group @key{RET}}.

@node Colors on a TTY
@section How do I get colors and syntax highlighting on a TTY?
@cindex Colors on a TTY
@cindex Syntax highlighting on a TTY
@cindex Console, colors

Colors and faces are supported in non-windowed mode, i.e., on Unix and
GNU/Linux text-only terminals and consoles, and when invoked as
@samp{emacs -nw} on X, MS-DOS and MS-Windows.  Emacs automatically
detects color support at startup and uses it if available.  If you
think that your terminal supports colors, but Emacs won't use them,
check the @code{termcap} entry for your display type for color-related
capabilities.

The command @kbd{M-x list-colors-display} pops up a window which
exhibits all the colors Emacs knows about on the current display.

Syntax highlighting is on by default since version 22.1.

@cindex direct color in terminals
Emacs 26.1 and later support direct color mode in terminals.  If Emacs
finds Terminfo capabilities @samp{setb24} and @samp{setf24}, 24-bit
direct color mode is used.  The capability strings are expected to
take one 24-bit pixel value as argument and transform the pixel to a
string that can be used to send 24-bit colors to the terminal.

Standard terminal definitions don't support these capabilities and
therefore custom definition is needed.

@example
$ cat terminfo-custom.src

xterm-emacs|xterm with 24-bit direct color mode for Emacs,
  use=xterm-256color,
  setb24=\E[48\:2\:\:%p1%@{65536@}%/%d\:%p1%@{256@}%/%@{255@}%&\
     %d\:%p1%@{255@}%&%dm,
  setf24=\E[38\:2\:\:%p1%@{65536@}%/%d\:%p1%@{256@}%/%@{255@}%&\
     %d\:%p1%@{255@}%&%dm,

$ tic -x -o ~/.terminfo terminfo-custom.src

$ TERM=xterm-emacs emacs -nw
@end example

@cindex 24-bit direct color mode
Emacs 27.1 and later support Terminfo capability @samp{RGB} for
detecting 24-bit direct color mode.  Multiple standard terminal
definitions support this capability.

@example
$ TERM=xterm-direct infocmp | grep seta[bf]

  setab=\E[%?%p1%@{8@}%<%t4%p1%d%e48\:2\:\:%p1%@{65536@}%/\
     %d\:%p1%@{256@}%/%@{255@}%&%d\:%p1%@{255@}%&%d%;m,
  setaf=\E[%?%p1%@{8@}%<%t3%p1%d%e38\:2\:\:%p1%@{65536@}%/\
     %d\:%p1%@{256@}%/%@{255@}%&%d\:%p1%@{255@}%&%d%;m,

$ TERM=xterm-direct emacs -nw
@end example

If your terminal is incompatible with XTerm, you may have to use
another @env{TERM} definition.  Any terminal whose name includes
@samp{direct} should be a candidate.  The @command{toe} command can be
used to find out which of these are installed on your system:

@example
$ toe | grep '\-direct'

konsole-direct  konsole with direct-color indexing
vte-direct      vte with direct-color indexing
st-direct       st with direct-color indexing
xterm-direct2   xterm with direct-color indexing (old)
xterm-direct    xterm with direct-color indexing
@end example

If Terminfo database is not available, but 24-bit direct color mode is
supported, it can still be enabled by defining the environment
variable @env{COLORTERM} to @samp{truecolor}.

Terminals with @samp{RGB} capability treat pixels #000001 - #000007 as
indexed colors to maintain backward compatibility with applications
that are unaware of direct color mode.  Therefore the seven darkest
blue shades may not be available.  If this is a problem, you can
always use custom terminal definition with @samp{setb24} and
@samp{setf24}.

@cindex Debugging @file{.emacs} file
@cindex @file{.emacs} debugging
@cindex Init file debugging
@cindex @samp{-debug-init} option

Start Emacs with the @samp{-debug-init} command-line option.  This
enables the Emacs Lisp debugger before evaluating your @file{.emacs}
file, and places you in the debugger if something goes wrong.  The top
line in the @file{trace-back} buffer will be the error message, and the
second or third line of that buffer will display the Lisp code from your
@file{.emacs} file that caused the problem.

You can also evaluate an individual function or argument to a function
in your @file{.emacs} file by moving the cursor to the end of the
function or argument and typing @kbd{C-x C-e} (@kbd{M-x
eval-last-sexp}).

Use @kbd{C-h v} (@kbd{M-x describe-variable}) to check the value of
variables which you are trying to set or use.

@cindex Line number, displaying the current
@cindex Column, displaying the current
@cindex @code{mode-line-format}

By default, Emacs displays the current line number of the point in the
mode line.  You can toggle this feature off or on with the command
@kbd{M-x line-number-mode}, or by setting the variable
@code{line-number-mode}.  Note that Emacs will not display the line
number if the buffer's size in bytes is larger than the value of the
variable @code{line-number-display-limit}.

You can similarly display the current column with
@kbd{M-x column-number-mode}, or by putting the form

@lisp
(setq column-number-mode t)
@end lisp

@noindent
in your @file{.emacs} file.  This feature is off by default.

The @code{"%c"} format specifier in the variable @code{mode-line-format}
will insert the current column's value into the mode line.  See the
documentation for @code{mode-line-format} (using @kbd{C-h v
mode-line-format @key{RET}}) for more information on how to set and use
this variable.

@cindex Set number capability in @code{vi} emulators
The @samp{display-line-numbers} package (added to Emacs in version
26.1) displays line numbers in the text area, before each line, like
the ``set number'' capability of @samp{vi}.  Customize the
buffer-local variable @code{display-line-numbers} to activate this
optional display.  Alternatively, you can use the
@code{display-line-numbers-mode} minor mode or the global
@code{global-display-line-numbers-mode}.  When using these modes,
customize @code{display-line-numbers-type} with the same value as you
would use with @code{display-line-numbers}.

There is also the @samp{linum} package (distributed with Emacs since
version 23.1) which will henceforth become obsolete.  Users and
developers are encouraged to use @samp{display-line-numbers} instead.

@cindex @code{frame-title-format}

The contents of an Emacs frame's titlebar is controlled by the variable
@code{frame-title-format}, which has the same structure as the variable
@code{mode-line-format}.  (Use @kbd{C-h v} or @kbd{M-x
describe-variable} to get information about one or both of these
variables.)

By default, the titlebar for a frame does contain the name of the buffer
currently being visited, except if there is a single frame.  In such a
case, the titlebar contains Emacs invocation name and the name of the
machine at which Emacs was invoked.  This is done by setting
@code{frame-title-format} to the default value of

@lisp
(multiple-frames "%b" ("" "%b - GNU Emacs at " system-name))
@end lisp

To modify the behavior such that frame titlebars contain the buffer's
name regardless of the number of existing frames, include the following
in your @file{.emacs}:

@lisp
(setq frame-title-format "%b")
@end lisp

@lisp
(add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.@var{bar}\\'" . @var{foo}-mode))
@end lisp

Alternatively, put this somewhere in the first line of any file you want to
edit in the mode @var{foo} (in the second line, if the first line begins
with @samp{#!}):

@example
-*- @var{foo} -*-
@end example

@cindex Major mode for shell scripts
The variable @code{interpreter-mode-alist} specifies which mode to use
when loading an interpreted script (e.g., shell, python, etc.).  Emacs
determines which interpreter you're using by examining the first line of
the script.  Use @kbd{C-h v} (or @kbd{M-x describe-variable}) on
@code{interpreter-mode-alist} to learn more.

@end lisp

According to the documentation string for @code{delete-selection-mode}
(which you can read using @kbd{M-x describe-function @key{RET}
delete-selection-mode @key{RET}}):

@quotation
When Delete Selection mode is enabled, typed text replaces the selection
if the selection is active.  Otherwise, typed text is just inserted at
point regardless of any selection.
@end quotation

This mode also allows you to delete (not kill) the highlighted region by

(setq case-fold-search t)   ; make searches case insensitive
@end lisp

@cindex Case sensitivity in replacements

Similarly, for replacing, the variable @code{case-replace} determines
whether replacements preserve case.

You can also toggle case sensitivity at will in isearch with @kbd{M-c}.

To change the case sensitivity just for one major mode, use the major
mode's hook.  For example:

@lisp

@cindex Regexps and unprintable characters

To search for a single character that appears in the buffer as, for
example, @samp{\237}, you can type @kbd{C-s C-q 2 3 7}.
Searching for @strong{all} unprintable characters is best done with a
regular expression (@dfn{regexp}) search.  The easiest regexp to use for
the unprintable chars is the complement of the regexp for the printable
chars.

@itemize @bullet

@item
Regexp for the printable chars: @samp{[\t\n\r\f -~]}

@item
Regexp for the unprintable chars: @samp{[^\t\n\r\f -~]}

@end itemize

To type these special characters in an interactive argument to
@code{isearch-forward-regexp} or @code{re-search-forward}, you need to
use @kbd{C-q}.  (@samp{\t}, @samp{\n}, @samp{\r}, and @samp{\f} stand
respectively for @key{TAB}, @key{LFD}, @key{RET}, and @kbd{C-l}.)  So,
to search for unprintable characters using @code{re-search-forward}:

@kbd{M-x re-search-forward @key{RET} [^ @key{TAB} C-q @key{LFD} C-q @key{RET} C-q C-l @key{SPC} -~] @key{RET}}

Using @code{isearch-forward-regexp}:

@kbd{C-M-s [^ @key{TAB} @key{LFD} C-q @key{RET} C-q C-l @key{SPC} -~]}

To delete all unprintable characters, simply use replace-regexp:

@kbd{M-x replace-regexp @key{RET} [^ @key{TAB} C-q @key{LFD} C-q @key{RET} C-q C-l @key{SPC} -~] @key{RET} @key{RET}}

Replacing is similar to the above.  To replace all unprintable
characters with a colon, use:

M-x replace-regexp @key{RET} [^ @key{TAB} C-q @key{LFD} C-q @key{RET} C-q C-l @key{SPC} -~] @key{RET} : @key{RET}

@code{emacsclient}, which comes with Emacs, is for editing a file using
an already running Emacs rather than starting up a new Emacs.  It does
this by sending a request to the already running Emacs, which must be
expecting the request.

@itemize @bullet

@item
Setup:

Emacs must have executed the @code{server-start} function for
@samp{emacsclient} to work.  This can be done either by a command line
option:

@example
emacs -f server-start
@end example

or by invoking @code{server-start} from @file{.emacs}:

@lisp
(if (@var{some conditions are met}) (server-start))
@end lisp

To get your news reader, mail reader, etc., to invoke
@samp{emacsclient}, try setting the environment variable @code{EDITOR}
(or sometimes @code{VISUAL}) to the value @samp{emacsclient}.  You may
have to specify the full pathname of the @samp{emacsclient} program
instead.  Examples:

@example
# csh commands:
setenv EDITOR emacsclient

# using full pathname
setenv EDITOR /usr/local/emacs/etc/emacsclient

# sh command:
EDITOR=emacsclient ; export EDITOR
@end example

@item
Normal use:

When @samp{emacsclient} is run, it connects to the socket and passes its
command line options to Emacs, which at the next opportunity will visit
the files specified.  (Line numbers can be specified just like with
Emacs.)  The user will have to switch to the Emacs window by hand.  When
the user is done editing a file, the user can type @kbd{C-x #} (or
@kbd{M-x server-edit}) to indicate this.  If there is another buffer
requested by @code{emacsclient}, Emacs will switch to it; otherwise
@code{emacsclient} will exit, signaling the calling program to continue.

@cindex Indentation, how to customize
@cindex Customize indentation

The Emacs @code{cc-mode} features an interactive procedure for
customizing the indentation style, which is fully explained in the
@cite{CC Mode} manual that is part of the Emacs distribution, see
@ref{Customizing Indentation, , Customization Indentation, ccmode,
The CC Mode Manual}.  Here's a short summary of the procedure:

@enumerate
@item
Go to the beginning of the first line where you don't like the
indentation and type @kbd{C-c C-o}.  Emacs will prompt you for the
syntactic symbol; type @key{RET} to accept the default it suggests.

@item
Emacs now prompts for the offset of this syntactic symbol, showing the
default (the current definition) inside parentheses.  You can choose
one of these:

@table @code
@item 0
No extra indentation.
@item +
Indent one basic offset.
@item -
Outdent one basic offset.
@item ++
Indent two basic offsets
@item --
Outdent two basic offsets.
@item *
Indent half basic offset.
@item /
Outdent half basic offset.
@end table

@item
After choosing one of these symbols, type @kbd{C-c C-q} to reindent
the line or the block according to what you just specified.

@item
If you don't like the result, go back to step 1.  Otherwise, add the
following line to your @file{.emacs}:

@lisp
(c-set-offset '@var{syntactic-symbol} @var{offset})
@end lisp

@noindent
where @var{syntactic-symbol} is the name Emacs shows in the minibuffer
when you type @kbd{C-c C-o} at the beginning of the line, and
@var{offset} is one of the indentation symbols listed above (@code{+},
@code{/}, @code{0}, etc.)@: that you've chosen during the interactive
procedure.

@item
Go to the next line whose indentation is not to your liking and repeat
the process there.
@end enumerate

It is recommended to put all the resulting @code{(c-set-offset ...)}
customizations inside a C mode hook, like this:

@lisp
(defun my-c-mode-hook ()
  (c-set-offset ...)
  (c-set-offset ...))
(add-hook 'c-mode-hook 'my-c-mode-hook)
@end lisp

@noindent
Using @code{c-mode-hook} avoids the need to put a @w{@code{(require
'cc-mode)}} into your @file{.emacs} file, because @code{c-set-offset}
might be unavailable when @code{cc-mode} is not loaded.

Note that @code{c-mode-hook} runs for C source files only; use
@code{c++-mode-hook} for C@t{++} sources, @code{java-mode-hook} for
Java sources, etc.  If you want the same customizations to be in
effect in @emph{all} languages supported by @code{cc-mode}, use

Such behavior is automatic (in Text mode) in Emacs 20 and later.  From the

@example
** In Text mode, now only blank lines separate paragraphs.  This makes
it possible to get the full benefit of Adaptive Fill mode in Text mode,
and other modes derived from it (such as Mail mode).  @key{TAB} in Text
mode now runs the command @code{indent-relative}; this makes a practical
difference only when you use indented paragraphs.

If you want spaces at the beginning of a line to start a paragraph, use
the new mode, Paragraph Indent Text mode.
@end example

@cindex Prefixing lines
@cindex Fill prefix
If you have @code{auto-fill-mode} turned on (@pxref{Turning on auto-fill

character sequence, the @dfn{fill prefix}.  Type the prefix at the
beginning of a line, position point after it, and then type @kbd{C-x .}
(@code{set-fill-prefix}) to set the fill prefix.  Thereafter,
auto-filling will automatically put the fill prefix at the beginning of
new lines, and @kbd{M-q} (@code{fill-paragraph}) will maintain any fill
prefix when refilling the paragraph.

If you have paragraphs with different levels of indentation, you will
have to set the fill prefix to the correct value each time you move to a
new paragraph.  There are many packages available to deal with this
(@pxref{Packages that do not come with Emacs}).  Look for ``fill'' and
``indent'' keywords for guidance.

Use the @code{repeat} command (@kbd{C-x z}) to repeat the last

applied to the command.

You can also type @kbd{C-x @key{ESC} @key{ESC}}
(@code{repeat-complex-command}) to reinvoke commands that used the
minibuffer to get arguments.  In @code{repeat-complex-command} you can
type @kbd{M-p} and @kbd{M-n} (and also up-arrow and down-arrow, if your
keyboard has these keys) to scan through all the different complex
commands you've typed.

To repeat a set of commands, use keyboard macros.  Use @kbd{C-x (} and
@kbd{C-x )} to make a keyboard macro that invokes the command and then
type @kbd{C-x e}.  @xref{Keyboard Macros,,, emacs, The GNU Emacs Manual}.

@node Evaluating Emacs Lisp code
@section How do I execute (``evaluate'') a piece of Emacs Lisp code?
@cindex Evaluating Lisp code
@cindex Lisp forms, evaluating

There are a number of ways to execute (@dfn{evaluate}, in Lisp lingo) an
Emacs Lisp @dfn{form}:

@itemize @bullet

@item
If you want it evaluated every time you run Emacs, put it in a file
named @file{.emacs} in your home directory.  This is known as ``your
@file{.emacs} file,'' and contains all of your personal customizations.

@item
You can type the form in the @file{*scratch*} buffer, and then type
@key{LFD} (or @kbd{C-j}) after it.  The result of evaluating the form
will be inserted in the buffer.

@item
In @code{emacs-lisp-mode}, typing @kbd{C-M-x} evaluates a top-level form
before or around point.

@item
Typing @kbd{C-x C-e} in any buffer evaluates the Lisp form immediately
before point and prints its value in the echo area.

@item
Typing @kbd{M-:} or @kbd{M-x eval-expression} allows you to type a Lisp
form in the minibuffer which will be evaluated once you press @key{RET}.

@item
You can use @kbd{M-x load-file} to have Emacs evaluate all the Lisp
forms in a file.  (To do this from Lisp use the function @code{load}
instead.)

The functions @code{load-library}, @code{eval-region},
@code{eval-buffer}, @code{require}, and @code{autoload} are also
useful; see @ref{Emacs Lisp documentation}, if you want to learn more
about them.

@node Changing the length of a Tab
@section How do I change Emacs's idea of the @key{TAB} character's length?
@cindex Tab length
@cindex Length of tab character

Set the default value of the variable @code{tab-width}.  For example, to set
@key{TAB} stops every 10 characters, insert the following in your
@file{.emacs} file:

@lisp
(setq-default tab-width 10)
@end lisp

Do not confuse variable @code{tab-width} with variable
@code{tab-stop-list}.  The former is used for the display of literal
@key{TAB} characters.  The latter controls what characters are inserted
when you press the @key{TAB} character in certain modes.

@node Inserting text at the beginning of each line
@section How do I insert <some text> at the beginning of every line?
@cindex Prefixing a region with some text

@cindex News replies, inserting a prefix character

To do this to an entire buffer, type @kbd{M-< M-x replace-regexp
@key{RET} ^ @key{RET} your text @key{RET}}.

To do this to a region, use @code{string-insert-rectangle}.
Set the mark (@kbd{C-@key{SPC}}) at the beginning of the first line you
want to prefix, move the cursor to last line to be prefixed, and type
@kbd{M-x string-insert-rectangle @key{RET}}.  To do this for the whole
buffer, type @kbd{C-x h M-x string-insert-rectangle @key{RET}}.

If you are trying to prefix a yanked mail message with @samp{>}, you
might want to set the variable @code{mail-yank-prefix}.  In Message
buffers, you can even use @kbd{M-;} to cite yanked messages (@kbd{M-;}
runs the function @code{comment-region}, it is a general-purpose
mechanism to comment regions) (@pxref{Changing the included text prefix}).

are @samp{\(} and @samp{\)}.  Also, the string syntax for a backslash is
@samp{\\}.  To specify a regular expression like @samp{xxx\(foo\|bar\)}
in a Lisp string, use @samp{xxx\\(foo\\|bar\\)}.

Note the doubled backslashes!

@itemize @bullet

@item
Unlike in Unix @file{grep}, @file{sed}, etc., a complement character set
(@samp{[^...]})  can match a newline character (@key{LFD} a.k.a.@:
@kbd{C-j} a.k.a.@: @samp{\n}), unless newline is mentioned as one of the
characters not to match.

Dired mode (@kbd{M-x dired @key{RET}}, or @kbd{C-x d}) supports the
command @code{dired-do-find-regexp-and-replace} (@kbd{Q}), which allows
users to replace regular expressions in multiple files.

You can use this command to perform search/replace operations on
multiple files by following the following steps:

@itemize @bullet
@item
Assemble a list of files you want to operate on with either
@code{find-dired}, @code{find-name-dired} or @code{find-grep-dired}.

@item
Use @kbd{Q} to start a @code{query-replace-regexp} session on the marked

@end itemize

Another way to do the same thing is to use the ``tags'' feature of
Emacs: it includes the command @code{tags-query-replace} which performs
a query-replace across all the files mentioned in the @file{TAGS} file.

@node Disabling backups
@section How do I disable backup files?
@cindex Backups, disabling
@cindex Disabling backups

You probably don't want to do this, since backups are useful, especially
when something goes wrong.

To avoid seeing backup files (and other ``uninteresting'' files) in Dired,
load @code{dired-x} by adding the following to your @file{.emacs} file:

@lisp
(with-eval-after-load 'dired
  (require 'dired-x))
@end lisp

With @code{dired-x} loaded, @kbd{M-o} toggles omitting in each dired buffer.
You can make omitting the default for new dired buffers by putting the
following in your @file{.emacs}:

@lisp
(add-hook 'dired-mode-hook 'dired-omit-toggle)
@end lisp

If you're tired of seeing backup files whenever you do an @samp{ls} at
the Unix shell, try GNU @code{ls} with the @samp{-B} option.  GNU
@code{ls} is part of the GNU Fileutils package, available from
@url{https://ftp.gnu.org} and its mirrors (@pxref{Current GNU distributions}).

To disable or change the way backups are made,
@pxref{Backup Names,,, emacs, The GNU Emacs Manual}.

@cindex Backup files in a single directory
You can control where Emacs puts backup files by customizing the
variable @code{backup-directory-alist}.  This variable's value
specifies that files whose names match specific patters should have
their backups put in certain directories.  A typical use is to add the
element @code{("." . @var{dir})} to force Emacs to put @strong{all}
backup files in the directory @file{dir}.

@node Disabling auto-save-mode
@section How do I disable @code{auto-save-mode}?

@cindex Auto-saving
@cindex Saving at frequent intervals

You probably don't want to do this, since auto-saving is useful,
especially when Emacs or your computer crashes while you are editing a
document.

Instead, you might want to change the variable
@code{auto-save-interval}, which specifies how many keystrokes Emacs
waits before auto-saving.  Increasing this value forces Emacs to wait
longer between auto-saves, which might annoy you less.

You might also want to look into Sebastian Kremer's @code{auto-save}
package (@pxref{Packages that do not come with Emacs}).  This
package also allows you to place all auto-save files in one directory,
such as @file{/tmp}.

@node Going to a line by number
@section How can I go to a certain line given its number?
@cindex Going to a line by number
@cindex Compilation error messages
@cindex Recompilation

Are you sure you indeed need to go to a line by its number?  Perhaps all
you want is to display a line in your source file for which a compiler
printed an error message?  If so, compiling from within Emacs using the
@kbd{M-x compile} and @kbd{M-x recompile} commands is a much more
effective way of doing that.  Emacs automatically intercepts the compile
error messages, inserts them into a special buffer called
@file{*compilation*}, and lets you visit the locus of each message in
the source.  Type @kbd{C-x `} to step through the offending lines one by
one (you can also use @kbd{M-g M-p} and @kbd{M-g M-n} to go to the
previous and next matches directly).  Click @kbd{mouse-2} or press
@key{RET} on a message text in the @file{*compilation*} buffer to go
to the line whose number is mentioned in that message.

But if you indeed need to go to a certain text line, type @kbd{M-g M-g}
(which is the default binding of the @code{goto-line} function).
Emacs will prompt you for the number of the line and go to that line.

You can do this faster by invoking @code{goto-line} with a numeric
argument that is the line's number.  For example, @kbd{C-u 286 M-g M-g}
will jump to line number 286 in the current buffer.

@node Modifying pull-down menus
@section How can I create or modify new pull-down menu options?
@cindex Pull-down menus, creating or modifying
@cindex Menus, creating or modifying
@cindex Creating new menu options
@cindex Modifying pull-down menus
@cindex Menus and keymaps
@cindex Keymaps and menus

Each menu title (e.g., @samp{File}, @samp{Edit}, @samp{Buffers})
represents a local or global keymap.  Selecting a menu title with the
mouse displays that keymap's non-@code{nil} contents in the form of a menu.

So to add a menu option to an existing menu, all you have to do is add a
new definition to the appropriate keymap.  Adding a @samp{Forward Word}
item to the @samp{Edit} menu thus requires the following Lisp code:

@lisp
(define-key global-map
  [menu-bar edit forward]
  '("Forward word" . forward-word))
@end lisp

@noindent
The first line adds the entry to the global keymap, which includes
global menu bar entries.  Replacing the reference to @code{global-map}
with a local keymap would add this menu option only within a particular
mode.

The second line describes the path from the menu-bar to the new entry.
Placing this menu entry underneath the @samp{File} menu would mean
changing the word @code{edit} in the second line to @code{file}.

The third line is a cons cell whose first element is the title that will
be displayed, and whose second element is the function that will be
called when that menu option is invoked.

To add a new menu, rather than a new option to an existing menu, we must
define an entirely new keymap:

@lisp
(define-key global-map [menu-bar words]
  (cons "Words" (make-sparse-keymap "Words")))
@end lisp

The above code creates a new sparse keymap, gives it the name
@samp{Words}, and attaches it to the global menu bar.  Adding the
@samp{Forward Word} item to this new menu would thus require the
following code:

@lisp
(define-key global-map
  [menu-bar words forward]
  '("Forward word" . forward-word))
@end lisp

@noindent
Note that because of the way keymaps work, menu options are displayed
with the more recently defined items at the top.  Thus if you were to
define menu options @samp{foo}, @samp{bar}, and @samp{baz} (in that
order), the menu option @samp{baz} would appear at the top, and
@samp{foo} would be at the bottom.

One way to avoid this problem is to use the function @code{define-key-after},
which works the same as @code{define-key}, but lets you modify where items
appear.  The following Lisp code would insert the @samp{Forward Word}
item in the @samp{Edit} menu immediately following the @samp{Undo} item:

@lisp
(define-key-after
  (lookup-key global-map [menu-bar edit])
  [forward]
  '("Forward word" . forward-word)
  'undo)
@end lisp

Note how the second and third arguments to @code{define-key-after} are
different from those of @code{define-key}, and that we have added a new
(final) argument, the function after which our new key should be
defined.

To move a menu option from one position to another, simply evaluate
@code{define-key-after} with the appropriate final argument.

More detailed information---and more examples of how to create and
modify menu options---are in the @cite{Emacs Lisp Reference Manual}, under
``Menu Keymaps.''  (@xref{Emacs Lisp documentation}, for information on
this manual.)

@node Deleting menus and menu options
@section How do I delete menus and menu options?
@cindex Deleting menus and menu options
@cindex Menus, deleting

The simplest way to remove a menu is to set its keymap to @samp{nil}.
For example, to delete the @samp{Words} menu (@pxref{Modifying pull-down
menus}), use:

@lisp
(define-key global-map [menu-bar words] nil)
@end lisp

Similarly, removing a menu option requires redefining a keymap entry to
@code{nil}.  For example, to delete the @samp{Forward word} menu option
from the @samp{Edit} menu (we added it in @ref{Modifying pull-down
menus}), use:

@lisp
(define-key global-map [menu-bar edit forward] nil)

@node Turning on syntax highlighting
@section How do I turn on syntax highlighting?
@cindex Syntax highlighting
@cindex @code{font-lock-mode}
@cindex Highlighting based on syntax
@cindex Colorizing text
@cindex FAQ, @code{font-lock-mode}

@code{font-lock-mode} is the standard way to have Emacs perform syntax
highlighting in the current buffer.  It is enabled by default.

With @code{font-lock-mode} turned on, different types of text will
appear in different colors.  For instance, in a programming mode,
variables will appear in one face, keywords in a second, and comments in
a third.

To turn @code{font-lock-mode} off within an existing buffer, use
@kbd{M-x font-lock-mode @key{RET}}.

Highlighting a buffer with @code{font-lock-mode} can take quite a while,
and cause an annoying delay in display, so several features exist to
work around this.

@cindex Just-In-Time syntax highlighting
In Emacs 21 and later, turning on @code{font-lock-mode} automatically
activates the new @dfn{Just-In-Time fontification} provided by
@code{jit-lock-mode}.  @code{jit-lock-mode} defers the fontification of
portions of buffer until you actually need to see them, and can also
fontify while Emacs is idle.  This makes display of the visible portion
of a buffer almost instantaneous.  For details about customizing
@code{jit-lock-mode}, type @kbd{C-h f jit-lock-mode @key{RET}}.

@cindex Levels of syntax highlighting
@cindex Decoration level, in @code{font-lock-mode}
In versions of Emacs before 21, different levels of decoration are
available, from slight to gaudy.  More decoration means you need to wait
more time for a buffer to be fontified (or a faster machine).  To
control how decorated your buffers should become, set the value of
@code{font-lock-maximum-decoration} in your @file{.emacs} file, with a
@code{nil} value indicating default (usually minimum) decoration, and a
@code{t} value indicating the maximum decoration.  For the gaudiest
possible look, then, include the line

@lisp
(setq font-lock-maximum-decoration t)
@end lisp

@noindent
in your @file{.emacs} file.  You can also set this variable such that
different modes are highlighted in a different ways; for more
information, see the documentation for
@code{font-lock-maximum-decoration} with @kbd{C-h v} (or @kbd{M-x
describe-variable @key{RET}}).

Also see the documentation for the function @code{font-lock-mode},
available by typing @kbd{C-h f font-lock-mode} (@kbd{M-x
describe-function @key{RET} font-lock-mode @key{RET}}).

To print buffers with the faces (i.e., colors and fonts) intact, use
@kbd{M-x ps-print-buffer-with-faces} or @kbd{M-x
ps-print-region-with-faces}.  You will need a way to send text to a
PostScript printer, or a PostScript interpreter such as Ghostscript;
consult the documentation of the variables @code{ps-printer-name},
@code{ps-lpr-command}, and @code{ps-lpr-switches} for more details.

escape sequences.  In Emacs 23.2 and later, the package is enabled by
default; in earlier versions you can enable it by typing @kbd{M-x

@code{(add-hook 'shell-mode-hook 'ansi-color-for-comint-mode-on)} to

@end lisp

With older versions use the function @code{w32-send-sys-command}.  For

@lisp
(add-hook 'emacs-startup-hook
          (lambda () (w32-send-sys-command ?\xF030)))
@end lisp

To avoid the slightly distracting visual effect of Emacs starting with
its default frame size and then growing to fullscreen, you can add an
@samp{Emacs.Geometry} entry to the Windows registry settings.

@section Does Emacs have problems with large files?
@cindex Very large files, opening
@cindex Large files, opening
@cindex Opening very large files
@cindex Maximum file size
@cindex Files, maximum size

Emacs has an inherent fixed limitation on the size of buffers.  This
limit is stricter than the maximum size of objects supported by other
programs on the same architecture.

The maximum buffer size on 32-bit machines is 512 MBytes beginning
with version 23.2.  If Emacs was built using the
@code{--with-wide-int} flag, the maximum buffer size on 32-bit
machines is 2 GB.

Emacs compiled on a 64-bit machine can handle much larger buffers; up
to @code{most-positive-fixnum} (2.3 exabytes).

Due to things like decoding of multibyte characters, you can only
visit files with a size that is roughly half the buffer size limit.
When visiting compressed archives, the file size limit will be
smaller than that due to decompression.

@node ^M in the shell buffer
@section How do I get rid of @samp{^M} or echoed commands in my shell buffer?
@cindex Shell buffer, echoed commands and @samp{^M} in
@cindex Echoed commands in @code{shell-mode}

Try typing @kbd{M-x comint-strip-ctrl-m @key{RET}} while in @code{shell-mode} to
make them go away.  If that doesn't work, you have several options:

For @code{tcsh}, put this in your @file{.cshrc} (or @file{.tcshrc})
file:

@example
if ($?INSIDE_EMACS && $?tcsh)
    unset edit
    stty -icrnl -onlcr -echo susp ^Z
endif
@end example

Or put this in your @file{.emacs_tcsh} or @file{~/.emacs.d/init_tcsh.sh} file:

@example
unset edit
stty -icrnl -onlcr -echo susp ^Z
@end example

Alternatively, use @code{csh} in your shell buffers instead of
@code{tcsh}.  One way is:

@lisp
(setq explicit-shell-file-name "/bin/csh")
@end lisp

@noindent
and another is to do this in your @file{.cshrc} (or @file{.tcshrc})
file:

@example
setenv ESHELL /bin/csh
@end example

@noindent
(You must start Emacs over again with the environment variable properly
set for this to take effect.)

You can also set the @code{ESHELL} environment variable in Emacs Lisp
with the following Lisp form,

@lisp
(setenv "ESHELL" "/bin/csh")
@end lisp

The above solutions try to prevent the shell from producing the
@samp{^M} characters in the first place.  If this is not possible
(e.g., if you use a Windows shell), you can get Emacs to remove these
characters from the buffer by adding this to your @file{.emacs} init

On a related note: if your shell is echoing your input line in the shell
buffer, you might want to customize the @code{comint-process-echoes}
variable in your shell buffers, or try the following command in your
shell start-up file:

@example
stty -icrnl -onlcr -echo susp ^Z

@node Problems with Shell Mode
@section Why do I get an error message when I try to run @kbd{M-x shell}?

@cindex Shell Mode, problems
@cindex @code{explicit-shell-file-name}
This might happen because Emacs tries to look for the shell in a wrong
place.  If you know where your shell executable is, set the variable
@code{explicit-shell-file-name} in your @file{.emacs} file to point to
its full file name.

@cindex Antivirus programs, and Shell Mode
Some people have trouble with Shell Mode on MS-Windows because of
intrusive antivirus software; disabling the resident antivirus program
solves the problems in those cases.

@node Termcap/Terminfo entries for Emacs
@section Where is the termcap/terminfo entry for terminal type @samp{emacs}?
@cindex Termcap
@cindex Terminfo
@cindex Emacs entries for termcap/terminfo

The termcap entry for terminal type @samp{emacs} is ordinarily put in
the @samp{TERMCAP} environment variable of subshells.  It may help in
certain situations (e.g., using rlogin from shell buffer) to add an
entry for @samp{emacs} to the system-wide termcap file.  Here is a
correct termcap entry for @samp{emacs}:

@example
emacs:tc=unknown:
@end example

To make a terminfo entry for @samp{emacs}, use @code{tic} or
@code{captoinfo}.  You need to generate
@file{/usr/lib/terminfo/e/emacs}.  It may work to simply copy
@file{/usr/lib/terminfo/d/dumb} to @file{/usr/lib/terminfo/e/emacs}.

Having a termcap/terminfo entry will not enable the use of full screen
programs in shell buffers.  Use @kbd{M-x term} for that instead.

A workaround to the problem of missing termcap/terminfo entries is to
change terminal type @samp{emacs} to type @samp{dumb} or @samp{unknown}
in your shell start up file.  @code{csh} users could put this in their
@file{.cshrc} files:

@example
if ("$term" == emacs) set term=dumb
@end example

@node Errors with init files
@section Why does Emacs say @samp{Error in init file}?
@cindex Error in @file{.emacs}
@cindex Error in init file
@cindex Init file, errors in

@cindex Debugging @file{.emacs} file

An error occurred while loading either your @file{.emacs} file or the
system-wide file @file{site-lisp/default.el}.  Emacs pops the
@file{*Messages*} buffer, and puts there some additional information
about the error, to provide some hints for debugging.

For information on how to debug your @file{.emacs} file, see
@ref{Debugging a customization file}.

It may be the case that you need to load some package first, or use a
hook that will be evaluated after the package is loaded.  A common case
of this is explained in @ref{Terminal setup code works after Emacs has
begun}.

@node Emacs ignores X resources
@section Why does Emacs ignore my X resources (my .Xdefaults file)?
@cindex X resources being ignored
@cindex Ignored X resources
@cindex @file{.Xdefaults}

Emacs searches for X resources in the files specified by the following
environment variables:

@itemize @bullet

@item @code{XFILESEARCHPATH}
@item @code{XUSERFILESEARCHPATH}
@item @code{XAPPLRESDIR}

@end itemize

This emulates the functionality provided by programs written using the
Xt toolkit.

@code{XFILESEARCHPATH} and @code{XUSERFILESEARCHPATH} should be a list
of file names separated by colons.  @code{XAPPLRESDIR} should be a list
of directories separated by colons.

Emacs searches for X resources:

@enumerate

@item
specified on the command line, with the @samp{-xrm RESOURCESTRING} option,

@item
then in the value of the @samp{XENVIRONMENT} environment variable,

@itemize @minus

@item
or if that is unset, in the file named
@file{~/.Xdefaults-@var{hostname}} if it exists (where @var{hostname} is
the name of the machine Emacs is running on),

@end itemize

@item
then in the screen-specific and server-wide resource properties provided
by the server,

@itemize @minus

@item
or if those properties are unset, in the file named @file{~/.Xdefaults}
if it exists,

@end itemize

@item
then in the files listed in @samp{XUSERFILESEARCHPATH},

@itemize @minus

@item
or in files named @file{@var{lang}/Emacs} in directories listed in
@samp{XAPPLRESDIR} (where @var{lang} is the value of the @code{LANG}
environment variable), if the @samp{LANG} environment variable is set,
@item
or in files named Emacs in the directories listed in @samp{XAPPLRESDIR}
@item
or in @file{~/@var{lang}/Emacs} (if the @code{LANG} environment variable
is set),
@item
or in @file{~/Emacs},

@end itemize

@item
then in the files listed in  @code{XFILESEARCHPATH}.

@end enumerate

@node Emacs ignores frame parameters
@section Why don't my customizations of the frame parameters work?
@cindex Frame parameters

This probably happens because you have set the frame parameters in the
variable @code{initial-frame-alist}.  That variable holds parameters
used only for the first frame created when Emacs starts.  To customize
the parameters of all frames, change the variable
@code{default-frame-alist} instead.

These two variables exist because many users customize the initial frame
in a special way.  For example, you could determine the position and
size of the initial frame, but would like to control the geometry of the
other frames by individually positioning each one of them.


@node Editing files with $ in the name
@section How do I edit a file with a @samp{$} in its name?
@cindex Editing files with @samp{$} in the name
@cindex @samp{$} in file names
@cindex File names containing @samp{$}, editing

When entering a file name in the minibuffer, Emacs will attempt to expand
a @samp{$} followed by a word as an environment variable.  To suppress
this behavior, type @kbd{$$} instead.

@node Shell mode loses the current directory
@section Why does shell mode lose track of the shell's current directory?
@cindex Current directory and @code{shell-mode}
@cindex @code{shell-mode} and current directory
@cindex Directory, current in @code{shell-mode}

Emacs has no way of knowing when the shell actually changes its
directory.  This is an intrinsic limitation of Unix.  So it tries to
guess by recognizing @samp{cd} commands.  If you type @kbd{cd} followed
by directory with a variable reference (@kbd{cd $HOME/bin}) or
with a shell metacharacter (@kbd{cd ../lib*}), Emacs will fail to
correctly guess the shell's new current directory.  A huge variety of
fixes and enhancements to shell mode for this problem have been written
to handle this problem (@pxref{Finding a package with particular
functionality}).

You can tell Emacs the shell's current directory with the command
@kbd{M-x dirs}.

@cindex X events and security

@itemize @bullet

@item
Third party packages.

Any package you install into Emacs can run arbitrary code with the
same privileges as the Emacs process itself.  Be aware of this when
you use the package system (e.g. @code{M-x list-packages}) with third
party archives.  Use only third parties that you can trust!

@item
The @code{file-local-variable} feature.  (Yes, a risk, but easy to
change.)

There is an Emacs feature that allows the setting of local values for
variables when editing a file by including specially formatted text near
the end of the file.  This feature also includes the ability to have
arbitrary Emacs Lisp code evaluated when the file is visited.
Obviously, there is a potential for Trojan horses to exploit this
feature.

Emacs has a list of local variables that are known to be safe to set.
If a file tries to set any variable outside this list, it asks the
user to confirm whether the variables should be set. You can also tell
Emacs whether to allow the evaluation of Emacs Lisp code found at the
bottom of files by setting the variable @code{enable-local-eval}.

@xref{File Variables,,, emacs, The GNU Emacs Manual}.

@item
Synthetic X events.  (Yes, a risk; use @samp{MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1} or
better.)

Emacs accepts synthetic X events generated by the @code{SendEvent}
request as though they were regular events.  As a result, if you are
using the trivial host-based authentication, other users who can open X
connections to your X workstation can make your Emacs process do
anything, including run other processes with your privileges.

The only fix for this is to prevent other users from being able to open
X connections.  The standard way to prevent this is to use a real
authentication mechanism, such as @samp{MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1}.  If using
the @code{xauth} program has any effect, then you are probably using
@samp{MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1}.  Your site may be using a superior
authentication method; ask your system administrator.

If real authentication is not a possibility, you may be satisfied by
just allowing hosts access for brief intervals while you start your X
programs, then removing the access.  This reduces the risk somewhat by
narrowing the time window when hostile users would have access, but
@emph{does not eliminate the risk}.

On most computers running Unix and X, you enable and disable
access using the @code{xhost} command.  To allow all hosts access to
your X server, use

@example
xhost +
@end example

@noindent
at the shell prompt, which (on an HP machine, at least) produces the
following message:

@example
access control disabled, clients can connect from any host
@end example

To deny all hosts access to your X server (except those explicitly
allowed by name), use

@example
xhost -
@end example

On the test HP computer, this command generated the following message:

@example
access control enabled, only authorized clients can connect
@end example

@end itemize

@node Dired claims that no file is on this line
@section Dired says, @samp{no file on this line} when I try to do something.
@cindex Dired does not see a file

Dired uses a regular expression to find the beginning of a file name.
In a long Unix-style directory listing (@samp{ls -l}), the file name
starts after the date.  The regexp has thus been written to look for the
date.  By default, it should understand dates and times regardless of
the language, but if your directory listing has an unusual format, Dired
may get confused.

There are two approaches to solving this.  The first one involves
setting things up so that @samp{ls -l} outputs a more standard format.
See your OS manual for more information.

The second approach involves changing the regular expression used by
dired, @code{directory-listing-before-filename-regexp}.

@node Installing Emacs
@section How do I install Emacs?
@cindex Installing Emacs
@cindex Unix systems, installing Emacs on
@cindex Downloading and installing Emacs
@cindex Building Emacs from source
@cindex Source code, building Emacs from

This answer is meant for users of Unix and Unix-like systems.  Users of
other operating systems should see the series of questions beginning
with @ref{Emacs for MS-DOS}, which describe where to get non-Unix source
and binaries, and how to install Emacs on those systems.

Most GNU/Linux distributions provide pre-built Emacs packages.
If Emacs is not installed already, you can install it by running (as
root) a command such as @samp{dnf install emacs} (Red Hat and
derivatives; use @samp{yum} in older distributions) or
@samp{apt-get install emacs} (Debian and derivatives).

If you want to compile Emacs yourself, read the file @file{INSTALL} in
the source distribution.  In brief:

@itemize @bullet

@item
First download the Emacs sources.  @xref{Current GNU distributions}, for
a list of sites that make them available.  On @url{https://ftp.gnu.org},
the main GNU distribution site, sources are available as

@c Don't include VER in the file name, because pretests are not there.
@uref{https://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/emacs/emacs-VERSION.tar.gz}

(Replace @samp{VERSION} with the relevant version number, e.g., @samp{28.1}.)

@item
Next uncompress and extract the source files.  This requires
the @code{gzip} and @code{tar} programs, which are standard utilities.
If your system does not have them, these can also be downloaded from
@url{https://ftp.gnu.org}.

GNU @code{tar} can uncompress and extract in a single-step:

@example
tar -zxvf emacs-VERSION.tar.gz
@end example

@item
At this point, the Emacs sources should be sitting in a directory called
@file{emacs-VERSION}.  On most common Unix and Unix-like systems,
you should be able to compile Emacs with the following commands:

@example
cd emacs-VERSION
./configure         # configure Emacs for your particular system
make                # use Makefile to build components, then Emacs
@end example

If the @code{make} completes successfully, the odds are fairly good that
the build has gone well.  (@xref{Problems building Emacs}, if you weren't
successful.)

@item
By default, Emacs is installed in @file{/usr/local}.  To actually
install files, become the superuser and type

@example
make install
@end example

Note that @samp{make install} will overwrite @file{/usr/local/bin/emacs}
and any Emacs Info files that might be in @file{/usr/local/share/info/}.

@end itemize

@node Problems building Emacs

@cindex Package, finding
@cindex Finding an Emacs Lisp package
@cindex Functionality, finding a particular package

First of all, you should check to make sure that the package isn't
already available.  For example, typing @kbd{M-x apropos @key{RET}
python @key{RET}} lists all functions and variables containing the
string @samp{python}.

It is also possible that the package is on your system, but has not been
loaded.  To see which packages are available for loading, look through
your computer's lisp directory (@pxref{File-name conventions}).  The Lisp
source to most packages contains a short description of how they
should be loaded, invoked, and configured---so before you use or
modify a Lisp package, see if the author has provided any hints in the
source code.

The command @kbd{C-h p} (@code{finder-by-keyword}) allows you to browse
the constituent Emacs packages.

For advice on how to find extra packages that are not part of Emacs,
see @ref{Packages that do not come with Emacs}.

@cindex Finding other packages
@cindex Lisp packages that do not come with Emacs
@cindex Packages, those that do not come with Emacs
@cindex Emacs Lisp Archive

The easiest way to add more features to your Emacs is to use the
command @kbd{M-x list-packages}.  This contacts the
@uref{https://elpa.gnu.org, GNU ELPA} (``Emacs Lisp Package Archive'')
server and fetches the list of additional packages that it offers.
These are GNU packages that are available for use with Emacs, but are
distributed separately from Emacs itself, for reasons of space, etc.
You can browse the resulting @file{*Packages*} buffer to see what is
available, and then Emacs can automatically download and install the
packages that you select.  @xref{Packages,,, emacs, The GNU Emacs Manual}.

There are other Emacs Lisp package archives.  To use additional
archives, you can customize the @code{package-archives} variable.
Those archives have no affiliation with GNU Emacs, and we do not
monitor how they are maintained.  They may pay close attention to
correctness and safety of the code, or they may give only cursory
attention.

Also, packages hosted on these other archives may encourage or require
you to install and use other nonfree programs.  Unless you can verify
that a package is free software, and that it functions without
installing any nonfree software, we recommend for your freedom's sake
that you stay away from it.

The @uref{https://lists.gnu.org/mailman/listinfo/gnu-emacs-sources,
GNU Emacs sources mailing list} is an official place where people can
post or announce their extensions to Emacs.

The @uref{https://emacswiki.org, Emacs Wiki} contains pointers to some
additional extensions.  @uref{https://wikemacs.org, WikEmacs} is an
alternative wiki for Emacs.

It is impossible for us to list here all the sites that offer Emacs
Lisp packages.  If you are interested in a specific feature, then
after checking Emacs itself and GNU ELPA, a web search is often the
best way to find results.

@node What was XEmacs?
@section What was XEmacs?
@cindex XEmacs

XEmacs was a branch version of Emacs that is no longer actively
developed.  XEmacs last released a new version on January 30, 2009,
and it lacks many important features that exist in Emacs.  Since its
development has stopped, we do not expect to see any new releases.

In the past, it was not uncommon for Emacs packages to include code
for compatibility with XEmacs.  Nowadays, most built-in and third party
packages have either stopped supporting XEmacs or were developed
exclusively for Emacs.

XEmacs was initially derived from a prerelease version of Emacs 19.
If you want to talk about these two versions and distinguish them,
please call them ``Emacs'' and ``XEmacs.''  To contrast ``XEmacs''
with ``GNU Emacs'' would be misleading, since XEmacs too has its
origin in the work of the GNU Project.  Terms such as ``Emacsen'' and
``(X)Emacs'' are not wrong, but they are not very clear, so it
is better to write ``Emacs and XEmacs.''

@node Binding keys to commands
@section How do I bind keys (including function keys) to commands?
@cindex Binding keys to commands
@cindex Keys, binding to commands
@cindex Commands, binding keys to

Keys can be bound to commands either interactively or in your
@file{.emacs} file.  To interactively bind keys for all modes, type
@kbd{M-x global-set-key @key{RET} @var{key} @var{cmd} @key{RET}}.

To bind a key just in the current major mode, type @kbd{M-x
local-set-key @key{RET} @var{key} @var{cmd} @key{RET}}.

@xref{Key Bindings,,, emacs, The GNU Emacs Manual}.

To make the process of binding keys interactively easier, use the
following ``trick'': First bind the key interactively, then immediately
type @kbd{C-x @key{ESC} @key{ESC} C-a C-k C-g}.  Now, the command needed
to bind the key is in the kill ring, and can be yanked into your
@file{.emacs} file.  If the key binding is global, no changes to the
command are required.  For example,

@lisp
(global-set-key [f1] 'help-for-help)
@end lisp

@noindent
can be placed directly into the @file{.emacs} file.  If the key binding is
local, the command is used in conjunction with the @samp{add-hook} function.
For example, in TeX mode, a local binding might be

@lisp
(add-hook 'tex-mode-hook
  (lambda ()
   (local-set-key [f1] 'help-for-help)))
@end lisp


@itemize @bullet

@item
Control characters in key sequences, in the form yanked from the kill
ring are given in their graphic form---i.e., @key{CTRL} is shown as
@samp{^}, @key{TAB} as a set of spaces (usually 8), etc.  You may want
to convert these into their vector or string forms.

@item
If a prefix key of the character sequence to be bound is already
bound as a complete key, then you must unbind it before the new
binding.  For example, if @kbd{ESC @{} is previously bound:

@lisp
(global-unset-key [?\e ?@{])   ;;   or
(local-unset-key [?\e ?@{])
@end lisp

@item
Aside from commands and ``lambda lists,'' a vector or string also
can be bound to a key and thus treated as a macro.  For example:

@lisp
(global-set-key [f10] [?\C-x?\e?\e?\C-a?\C-k?\C-g])  ;;  or
(global-set-key [f10] "\C-x\e\e\C-a\C-k\C-g")
@end lisp

@end itemize

@node Invalid prefix characters
@section Why does Emacs say @samp{Key sequence XXX uses invalid prefix characters}?
@cindex Prefix characters, invalid
@cindex Invalid prefix characters
@cindex Misspecified key sequences

Usually, one of two things has happened.  In one case, the control
character in the key sequence has been misspecified (e.g., @samp{C-f}
used instead of @samp{\C-f} within a Lisp expression).  In the other
case, a @dfn{prefix key} in the keystroke sequence you were trying to bind
was already bound as a @dfn{complete key}.  Historically, the @samp{ESC [}
prefix was usually the problem, in which case you should evaluate either
of these forms before attempting to bind the key sequence:

@lisp
(global-unset-key [?\e ?[])  ;;  or
(global-unset-key "\e[")
@end lisp

@node Terminal setup code works after Emacs has begun
@section Why doesn't this [terminal or window-system setup] code work in my @file{.emacs} file, but it works just fine after Emacs starts up?
@cindex Terminal setup code in @file{.emacs}

During startup, Emacs initializes itself according to a given code/file
order.  If some of the code executed in your @file{.emacs} file needs to
be postponed until the initial terminal or window-system setup code has
been executed but is not, then you will experience this problem (this
code/file execution order is not enforced after startup).

To postpone the execution of Emacs Lisp code until after terminal or
window-system setup, treat the code as a @dfn{lambda list} and add it to
@code{emacs-startup-hook} (or @code{tty-setup-hook} in Emacs 24.4 and
newer).  For example,

@lisp
(add-hook 'emacs-startup-hook
          (lambda ()
           (when (string-match "\\`vt220" (or (getenv "TERM") ""))
             ;; Make vt220's "Do" key behave like M-x:
             (global-set-key [do] 'execute-extended-command))))

@node X key translations for Emacs
@section How do I set the X key ``translations'' for Emacs?
@cindex X key translations
@cindex Key translations under X
@cindex Translations for keys under X

Emacs is not written using the Xt library by default, so there are no
``translations'' to be set.  (We aren't sure how to set such translations
if you do build Emacs with Xt; please let us know if you've done this!)

The only way to affect the behavior of keys within Emacs is through
@code{xmodmap} (outside Emacs) or @code{define-key} (inside Emacs).  The
@code{define-key} command should be used in conjunction with the
@code{local-function-key-map} map.  For instance,

@lisp
(define-key function-key-map [M-@key{TAB}] [?\M-\t])
@end lisp

@noindent
defines the @kbd{M-@key{TAB}} key sequence.

@node Backspace invokes help
@section Why does the @key{Backspace} key invoke help?
@cindex @key{Backspace} key invokes help
@cindex Help invoked by @key{Backspace}
@cindex @key{DEL} key does not delete

The @key{Backspace} key (on most keyboards) generates @acronym{ASCII} code 8.
@kbd{C-h} sends the same code.  In Emacs by default @kbd{C-h} invokes
help-command.  This is intended to be easy to remember since the first
letter of @samp{help} is @samp{h}.  The easiest solution to this problem
is to use @kbd{C-h} (and @key{Backspace}) for help and @key{DEL} (the
@key{Delete} key) for deleting the previous character.

For many people this solution may be problematic:

@itemize @bullet

@item
They normally use @key{Backspace} outside of Emacs for deleting the
previous character.  This can be solved by making @key{DEL} the command
for deleting the previous character outside of Emacs.  On many Unix
systems, this command will remap @key{DEL}:

@example
stty erase '^?'
@end example

@item
The user may prefer the @key{Backspace} key for deleting the
previous character because it is more conveniently located on their
keyboard or because they don't even have a separate @key{Delete} key.
In this case, the @key{Backspace} key should be made to behave like
@key{Delete}.  There are several methods.

@itemize @minus
@item
Some terminals (e.g., VT3## terminals) and terminal emulators (e.g.,
TeraTerm) allow the character generated by the @key{Backspace} key to be
changed from a setup menu.

@item
You may be able to get a keyboard that is completely programmable, or a
terminal emulator that supports remapping of any key to any other key.

@item
You can control the effect of the @key{Backspace} and @key{Delete}
keys, on both dumb terminals and a windowed displays, by customizing
the option @code{normal-erase-is-backspace-mode}, or by invoking
@kbd{M-x normal-erase-is-backspace}.  See the documentation of these
symbols (@pxref{Emacs Lisp documentation}) for more info.

@item
It is possible to swap the @key{Backspace} and @key{DEL} keys inside
Emacs:

@lisp
(keyboard-translate ?\C-h ?\C-?)
@end lisp

@noindent
This is the recommended method of forcing @key{Backspace} to act as
@key{DEL}, because it works even in modes which bind @key{DEL} to
something other than @code{delete-backward-char}.

Similarly, you could remap @key{DEL} to act as @kbd{C-d}, which by
default deletes forward:

@lisp
(keyboard-translate ?\C-? ?\C-d)
@end lisp

@xref{Swapping keys}, for further details about @code{keyboard-translate}.

@item
Another approach is to switch key bindings and put help on @kbd{C-x h}
instead:

@lisp
(global-set-key "\C-h" 'delete-backward-char)

;; overrides mark-whole-buffer
(global-set-key "\C-xh" 'help-command)
@end lisp

@noindent
This method is not recommended, though: it only solves the problem for
those modes which bind @key{DEL} to @code{delete-backward-char}.  Modes
which bind @key{DEL} to something else, such as @code{view-mode}, will
not work as you expect when you press the @key{Backspace} key.  For this
reason, we recommend the @code{keyboard-translate} method, shown
above.

Other popular key bindings for help are @kbd{M-?} and @kbd{C-x ?}.
@end itemize

Don't try to bind @key{DEL} to @code{help-command}, because there are
many modes that have local bindings of @key{DEL} that will interfere.

@end itemize

When Emacs runs on a windowed display, it binds the @key{Delete} key
to a command which deletes the character at point, to make Emacs more
consistent with keyboard operation on these systems.

For more information about troubleshooting this problem, see @ref{DEL
Does Not Delete, , If @key{DEL} Fails to Delete, emacs, The GNU Emacs
Manual}.

@node Swapping keys
@section How do I swap two keys?
@cindex Swapping keys
@cindex Keys, swapping
@cindex @code{keyboard-translate}

You can swap two keys (or key sequences) by using the
@code{keyboard-translate} function.  For example, to turn @kbd{C-h}
into @key{DEL} and @key{DEL} to @kbd{C-h}, use

@lisp
(keyboard-translate ?\C-h ?\C-?)  ; translate 'C-h' to DEL
(keyboard-translate ?\C-? ?\C-h)  ; translate DEL to 'C-h'.
@end lisp

@noindent
The first key sequence of the pair after the function identifies what is
produced by the keyboard; the second, what is matched for in the
keymaps.

However, in the specific case of @kbd{C-h} and @key{DEL}, you should
toggle @code{normal-erase-is-backspace-mode} instead of calling
@code{keyboard-translate}.
@xref{DEL Does Not Delete,,, emacs, The GNU Emacs Manual}.

Keyboard translations are not the same as key bindings in keymaps.
Emacs contains numerous keymaps that apply in different situations, but
there is only one set of keyboard translations, and it applies to every
character that Emacs reads from the terminal.  Keyboard translations
take place at the lowest level of input processing; the keys that are
looked up in keymaps contain the characters that result from keyboard
translation.

@node Producing C-XXX with the keyboard
@section How do I produce C-XXX with my keyboard?
@cindex Producing control characters
@cindex Generating control characters
@cindex Control characters, generating

On terminals (but not under X), some common ``aliases'' are:

@table @asis

@item @kbd{C-2}  or  @kbd{C-@key{SPC}}
@kbd{C-@@}

@item @kbd{C-6}
@kbd{C-^}

@item @kbd{C-7}  or  @kbd{C-S--}
@kbd{C-_}

@item @kbd{C-4}
@kbd{C-\}

@item @kbd{C-5}
@kbd{C-]}

@item @kbd{C-/}
@kbd{C-?}

@end table

Often other aliases exist; use the @kbd{C-h c} command and try
@key{CTRL} with all of the digits on your keyboard to see what gets
generated.  You can also try the @kbd{C-h w} command if you know the
name of the command.

@node No Meta key
@section What if I don't have a @key{Meta} key?
@cindex No @key{Meta} key
@cindex @key{Meta} key, what to do if you lack it

On many keyboards, the @key{Alt} key acts as @key{Meta}, so try it.

Instead of typing @kbd{M-a}, you can type @kbd{@key{ESC} a}.  In fact,
Emacs converts @kbd{M-a} internally into @kbd{@key{ESC} a} anyway
(depending on the value of @code{meta-prefix-char}).  Note that you
press @key{Meta} and @kbd{a} together, but with @key{ESC}, you press
@key{ESC}, release it, and then press @kbd{a}.

@node No Escape key
@section What if I don't have an @key{Escape} key?
@cindex No Escape key
@cindex Lacking an Escape key
@cindex Escape key, lacking

Type @kbd{C-[} instead.  This should send @acronym{ASCII} code 27 just like an
Escape key would.  @kbd{C-3} may also work on some terminal (but not
under X).  For many terminals (notably DEC terminals) @key{F11}
generates @key{ESC}.  If not, the following form can be used to bind it:

@lisp
;; F11 is the documented ESC replacement on DEC terminals.
(define-key function-key-map [f11] [?\e])
@end lisp

On a dumb terminal such as a VT220, no.  It is rumored that certain
VT220 clones could have their @key{Compose} key configured this way.  If
you're using X, you might be able to do this with the @code{xmodmap}
command.

@node Binding combinations of modifiers and function keys
@section How do I bind a combination of modifier key and function key?
@cindex Modifiers and function keys
@cindex Function keys and modifiers
@cindex Binding modifiers and function keys

You can represent modified function keys in vector format by adding
prefixes to the function key symbol.  For example (from the Emacs
documentation):

@lisp
(global-set-key [?\C-x right] 'forward-page)
@end lisp

@noindent
where @samp{?\C-x} is the Lisp character constant for the character @kbd{C-x}.

You can use the modifier keys @key{Control}, @key{Meta}, @key{Hyper},
@key{Super}, @key{Alt}, and @key{Shift} with function keys.  To
represent these modifiers, prepend the strings @samp{C-}, @samp{M-},
@samp{H-}, @samp{s-}, @samp{A-}, and @samp{S-} to the symbol name.  Here
is how to make @kbd{H-M-RIGHT} move forward a word:

@lisp
(global-set-key [H-M-right] 'forward-word)
@end lisp

@itemize @bullet

@item
Not all modifiers are permitted in all situations.  @key{Hyper},
@key{Super}, and @key{Alt} are not available on Unix character
terminals.  Non-@acronym{ASCII} keys and mouse events (e.g., @kbd{C-=} and
@kbd{mouse-1}) also fall under this category.

If the advice in the Emacs manual fails, try all of these methods before
asking for further help:

@itemize @bullet

@item
You may have big problems using @code{mwm} as your window manager.
(Does anyone know a good generic solution to allow the use of the
@key{Meta} key in Emacs with @file{mwm}?)

@item
For X11: Make sure it really is a @key{Meta} key.  Use @code{xev} to
find out what keysym your @key{Meta} key generates.  It should be either
@code{Meta_L} or @code{Meta_R}.  If it isn't, use @file{xmodmap} to fix
the situation.  If @key{Meta} does generate @code{Meta_L} or
@code{Meta_R}, but @kbd{M-x} produces a non-@acronym{ASCII} character, put this in
your @file{~/.Xdefaults} file:

@example
 XTerm*eightBitInput:   false
 XTerm*eightBitOutput:  true
@end example

@item
Make sure the @code{pty} the @code{xterm} is using is passing 8 bit
characters.  @samp{stty -a} (or @samp{stty everything}) should show
@samp{cs8} somewhere.  If it shows @samp{cs7} instead, use @samp{stty
cs8 -istrip} (or @samp{stty pass8}) to fix it.

@item
If there is an @code{rlogin} connection between @code{xterm} and Emacs, the
@samp{-8} argument may need to be given to rlogin to make it pass all 8 bits
of every character.

@item
If Emacs is running on Ultrix, it is reported that evaluating
@code{(set-input-mode t nil)} helps.

@item
If all else fails, you can make @code{xterm} generate @kbd{@key{ESC} W} when
you type @kbd{M-W}, which is the same conversion Emacs would make if it
got the @kbd{M-W} anyway.  In X11R4, the following resource
specification will do this:

@example
XTerm.VT100.EightBitInput: false
@end example

@noindent
(This changes the behavior of the @code{insert-eight-bit} action.)

With older @code{xterm}s, you can specify this behavior with a translation:

@example
XTerm.VT100.Translations: #override \
  Meta<KeyPress>: string(0x1b) insert()
@end example

@noindent
You might have to replace @samp{Meta} with @samp{Alt}.

@node SPC no longer completes file names
@section Why doesn't @key{SPC} complete file names anymore?
@cindex @kbd{SPC} file name completion

Starting with Emacs 22.1, @kbd{SPC} no longer completes file names in
the minibuffer, so that file names with embedded spaces could be typed
without the need to quote the spaces.

You can get the old behavior by binding @kbd{SPC} to
@code{minibuffer-complete-word} in the minibuffer, as follows:

@lisp
(define-key minibuffer-local-filename-completion-map (kbd "SPC")
  'minibuffer-complete-word)

(define-key minibuffer-local-filename-must-match-map (kbd "SPC")

@node How to add fonts
@section How do I add fonts for use with Emacs?
@cindex add fonts for use with Emacs
@cindex intlfonts

First, download and install the BDF font files and any auxiliary
packages they need.  The GNU Intlfonts distribution can be found on
@uref{https://directory.fsf.org/localization/intlfonts.html, the GNU
Software Directory Web site}.

Next, if you are on X Window system, issue the following two commands
from the shell's prompt:

@example
  xset +fp /usr/local/share/emacs/fonts
  xset fp rehash
@end example

@noindent
(Modify the first command if you installed the fonts in a directory
that is not @file{/usr/local/share/emacs/fonts}.)  You also need to
arrange for these two commands to run whenever you log in, e.g., by
adding them to your window-system startup file, such as
@file{~/.xsessionrc} or @file{~/.gnomerc}.

Now, add the following line to your @file{~/.emacs} init file:

@lisp
  (add-to-list 'bdf-directory-list "/usr/share/emacs/fonts/bdf")
@end lisp

@noindent
(Again, modify the file name if you installed the fonts elsewhere.)

Finally, if you wish to use the installed fonts with @code{ps-print},
add the following line to your @file{~/.emacs}:

@lisp
  (setq ps-multibyte-buffer 'bdf-font-except-latin)
@end lisp

A few additional steps are necessary for MS-Windows; they are listed
below.

First, make sure @emph{all} the directories with BDF font files are
mentioned in @code{bdf-directory-list}.  On Unix and GNU/Linux
systems, one normally runs @kbd{make install} to install the BDF fonts
in the same directory.  By contrast, Windows users typically don't run
the Intlfonts installation command, but unpack the distribution in
some directory, which leaves the BDF fonts in its subdirectories.  For
example, assume that you unpacked Intlfonts in @file{C:/Intlfonts};
then you should set @code{bdf-directory-list} as follows:

@lisp
  (setq bdf-directory-list
    '("C:/Intlfonts/Asian"
      "C:/Intlfonts/Chinese" "C:/Intlfonts/Chinese.X"
      "C:/Intlfonts/Chinese.BIG" "C:/Intlfonts/Ethiopic"
      "C:/Intlfonts/European" "C:/Intlfonts/European.BIG"
      "C:/Intlfonts/Japanese" "C:/Intlfonts/Japanese.X"
      "C:/Intlfonts/Japanese.BIG" "C:/Intlfonts/Korean.X"
      "C:/Intlfonts/Misc"))
@end lisp

@cindex @code{w32-bdf-filename-alist}
@cindex @code{w32-find-bdf-fonts}
Next, you need to set up the variable @code{w32-bdf-filename-alist} to
an alist of the BDF fonts and their corresponding file names.
Assuming you have set @code{bdf-directory-list} to name all the
directories with the BDF font files, the following Lisp snippet will
set up @code{w32-bdf-filename-alist}:

@lisp
  (setq w32-bdf-filename-alist
     (w32-find-bdf-fonts bdf-directory-list))
@end lisp

Now, create fontsets for the BDF fonts:

@smallexample
  (create-fontset-from-fontset-spec
   "-*-fixed-medium-r-normal-*-16-*-*-*-c-*-fontset-bdf,
   japanese-jisx0208:-*-*-medium-r-normal-*-16-*-*-*-c-*-jisx0208.1983-*,
   katakana-jisx0201:-*-*-medium-r-normal-*-16-*-*-*-c-*-jisx0201*-*,
   latin-jisx0201:-*-*-medium-r-normal-*-16-*-*-*-c-*-jisx0201*-*,

   tibetan:-TibMdXA-fixed-medium-r-normal--16-160-72-72-m-160-MuleTibetan-0")
@end smallexample

Many of the international bdf fonts from Intlfonts are type 0, and
therefore need to be added to font-encoding-alist:

@lisp
  (setq font-encoding-alist
        (append '(("MuleTibetan-0" (tibetan . 0))
                  ("GB2312"        (chinese-gb2312 . 0))
                  ("JISX0208"      (japanese-jisx0208 . 0))
                  ("JISX0212"      (japanese-jisx0212 . 0))
                  ("VISCII"        (vietnamese-viscii-lower . 0))
                  ("KSC5601"       (korean-ksc5601 . 0))
                  ("MuleArabic-0"  (arabic-digit . 0))
                  ("MuleArabic-1"  (arabic-1-column . 0))
                  ("MuleArabic-2"  (arabic-2-column . 0)))
                font-encoding-alist))
@end lisp

You can now use the Emacs font menu to select the @samp{bdf: 16-dot medium}
fontset, or you can select it by setting the default font in your
@file{~/.emacs}:

@lisp
  (set-frame-font "fontset-bdf")

lists). With a prefix argument (i.e., typing @kbd{C-u} before @kbd{r}),
it replies only to the sender.  However, going through the whole
@kbd{C-u} business every time you want to reply is a pain.  This is the
best fix I've been able to come up with:

@lisp
(defun rmail-reply-t ()
  "Reply only to the sender of the current message. (See rmail-reply.)"
  (interactive)
  (rmail-reply t))

(add-hook 'rmail-mode-hook
  (lambda ()
    (define-key rmail-mode-map "r" 'rmail-reply-t)
    (define-key rmail-mode-map "R" 'rmail-reply)))
@end lisp

@node Automatically starting a mail or news reader

@cindex Starting mail/news reader automatically

To start Emacs in Gnus:

@example
emacs -f gnus
@end example

@noindent
in Rmail:

@example
emacs -f rmail
@end example

A more convenient way to start with Gnus:

@example
alias gnus 'emacs -f gnus'
gnus
@end example

It is probably unwise to automatically start your mail or news reader
from your @file{.emacs} file.  This would cause problems if you needed to run
two copies of Emacs at the same time.  Also, this would make it difficult for
you to start Emacs quickly when you needed to.

From the Gnus FAQ (@pxref{Reading news with Emacs}):

@quotation
If you have a slow machine, or are just really impatient, there are a
few things you can do to make Gnus run faster.

Set @code{gnus-check-new-newsgroups} and
@code{gnus-check-bogus-newsgroups} to @code{nil} to make startup faster.

Set @code{gnus-show-threads}, @code{gnus-use-cross-reference} and
@code{gnus-nov-is-evil} to @code{nil} to make entering and exiting the
summary buffer faster.

In the @file{*Newsgroup*} buffer, type @kbd{M-< C-x ( c y C-x ) M-0 C-x e}

Leave off the initial @kbd{M-<} if you only want to catch up from point
to the end of the @file{*Newsgroup*} buffer.
