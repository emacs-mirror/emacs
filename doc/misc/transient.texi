Taking inspiration from prefix keys and prefix arguments, Transient
implements a similar abstraction involving a prefix command, infix
arguments and suffix commands.  We could call this abstraction a
``transient command'', but because it always involves at least two
commands (a prefix and a suffix) we prefer to call it just a
``transient''.

When the user calls a transient prefix command, a transient
(temporary) keymap is activated, which binds the transient's infix
and suffix commands, and functions that control the transient state
are added to @code{pre-command-hook} and @code{post-command-hook}.  The available
suffix and infix commands and their state are shown in a popup buffer
until the transient is exited by invoking a suffix command.

Calling an infix command causes its value to be changed, possibly by
reading a new value in the minibuffer.

Calling a suffix command usually causes the transient to be exited
but suffix commands can also be configured to not exit the transient.

@node Introduction
@chapter Introduction

Taking inspiration from prefix keys and prefix arguments, Transient
implements a similar abstraction involving a prefix command, infix
arguments and suffix commands.  We could call this abstraction a
``transient command'', but because it always involves at least two
commands (a prefix and a suffix) we prefer to call it just a
``transient''.

@quotation
Transient keymaps are a feature provided by Emacs.  Transients as
implemented by this package involve the use of transient keymaps.

@cindex transient prefix command
Emacs provides a feature that it calls @dfn{prefix commands}.  When we
talk about ``prefix commands'' in this manual, then we mean our own kind
of ``prefix commands'', unless specified otherwise.  To avoid ambiguity
we sometimes use the terms @dfn{transient prefix command} for our kind and
``regular prefix command'' for the Emacs' kind.

@end quotation

When the user calls a transient prefix command, a transient
(temporary) keymap is activated, which binds the transient's infix and
suffix commands, and functions that control the transient state are
added to @code{pre-command-hook} and @code{post-command-hook}.  The available suffix
and infix commands and their state are shown in a popup buffer until
the transient state is exited by invoking a suffix command.

Calling an infix command causes its value to be changed.  How that is
done depends on the type of the infix command.  The simplest case is
an infix command that represents a command-line argument that does not
take a value.  Invoking such an infix command causes the switch to be
toggled on or off.  More complex infix commands may read a value from
the user, using the minibuffer.

Calling a suffix command usually causes the transient to be exited;
the transient keymaps and hook functions are removed, the popup buffer
no longer shows information about the (no longer bound) suffix
commands, the values of some public global variables are set, while
some internal global variables are unset, and finally the command is
actually called.  Suffix commands can also be configured to not exit
the transient.

A suffix command can, but does not have to, use the infix arguments in
much the same way any command can choose to use or ignore the prefix
arguments.  For a suffix command that was invoked from a transient, the
variable @code{transient-current-suffixes} and the function @code{transient-args}
serve about the same purpose as the variables @code{prefix-arg} and
@code{current-prefix-arg} do for any command that was called after the prefix
arguments have been set using a command such as @code{universal-argument}.

The information shown in the popup buffer while a transient is active
looks a bit like this:

@example
,-----------------------------------------
|Arguments
| -f Force (--force)
| -a Annotate (--annotate)
|
|Create
| t tag
| r release
`-----------------------------------------
@end example

@quotation
This is a simplified version of @code{magit-tag}.  Info manuals do not
support images or colored text, so the above ``screenshot'' lacks some
information; in practice you would be able to tell whether the
arguments @code{--force} and @code{--annotate} are enabled or not based on their
color.

@end quotation

@cindex command dispatchers
Transient can be used to implement simple ``command dispatchers''.  The
main benefit then is that the user can see all the available commands
in a popup buffer.  That is useful by itself because it frees the user
from having to remember all the keys that are valid after a certain
prefix key or command.  Magit's @code{magit-dispatch} (on @code{C-x M-g}) command is
an example of using Transient to merely implement a command
dispatcher.

In addition to that, Transient also allows users to interactively pass
arguments to commands.  These arguments can be much more complex than
what is reasonable when using prefix arguments.  There is a limit to
how many aspects of a command can be controlled using prefix
arguments.  Furthermore, what a certain prefix argument means for
different commands can be completely different, and users have to read
documentation to learn and then commit to memory what a certain prefix
argument means to a certain command.

Transient suffix commands, on the other hand, can accept dozens of
different arguments without the user having to remember anything.
When using Transient, one can call a command with arguments that
are just as complex as when calling the same function non-interactively
from Lisp.

Invoking a transient command with arguments is similar to invoking a
command in a shell with command-line completion and history enabled.
One benefit of the Transient interface is that it remembers history
not only on a global level (``this command was invoked using these
arguments, and previously it was invoked using those other arguments''),
but also remembers the values of individual arguments independently.
@xref{Using History}.

After a transient prefix command is invoked, @kbd{C-h @var{key}} can be used to
show the documentation for the infix or suffix command that @kbd{@var{key}} is
bound to (@pxref{Getting Help for Suffix Commands}), and infixes and
suffixes can be removed from the transient using @kbd{C-x l @var{key}}.  Infixes
and suffixes that are disabled by default can be enabled the same way.
@xref{Enabling and Disabling Suffixes}.

Transient ships with support for a few different types of specialized
infix commands.  A command that sets a command line option, for example,
has different needs than a command that merely toggles a boolean flag.
Additionally, Transient provides abstractions for defining new types,
which the author of Transient did not anticipate (or didn't get around
to implementing yet).

@node Invoking Transients
@section Invoking Transients
@cindex invoking transients

A transient prefix command is invoked like any other command by
pressing the key that is bound to that command.  The main difference
to other commands is that a transient prefix command activates a
transient keymap, which temporarily binds the transient's infix and
suffix commands.  Bindings from other keymaps may, or may not, be
disabled while the transient state is in effect.

There are two kinds of commands that are available after invoking a
transient prefix command; infix and suffix commands.  Infix commands
set some value (which is then shown in a popup buffer), without
leaving the transient.  Suffix commands, on the other hand, usually quit
the transient and they may use the values set by the infix commands,
i.e.@: the infix @strong{arguments}.

Instead of setting arguments to be used by a suffix command, infix
commands may also set some value by side-effect, e.g., by setting the
value of some variable.

@node Aborting and Resuming Transients
@section Aborting and Resuming Transients
@cindex aborting transients
@cindex resuming transients

@cindex quit transient
To quit the transient without invoking a suffix command press @code{C-g}.

Key bindings in transient keymaps may be longer than a single event.
After pressing a valid prefix key, all commands whose bindings do not
begin with that prefix key are temporarily unavailable and grayed out.
To abort the prefix key press @kbd{C-g} (which in this case only quits the
prefix key, but not the complete transient).

A transient prefix command can be bound as a suffix of another
transient.  Invoking such a suffix replaces the current transient
state with a new transient state, i.e.@: the available bindings change
and the information displayed in the popup buffer is updated
accordingly.  Pressing @kbd{C-g} while a nested transient is active only
quits the innermost transient, causing a return to the previous
transient.

@kbd{C-q} or @kbd{C-z} on the other hand always exits all transients.  If you use
the latter, then you can later resume the stack of transients using
@kbd{M-x transient-resume}.

@table @asis
@kindex C-g
@findex transient-quit-seq
@item @kbd{C-g} @tie{}@tie{}@tie{}@tie{}(@code{transient-quit-seq})
@kindex C-g
@findex transient-quit-one
@item @kbd{C-g} @tie{}@tie{}@tie{}@tie{}(@code{transient-quit-one})

This key quits the currently active incomplete key sequence, if any,
or else the current transient.  When quitting the current transient,
it returns to the previous transient, if any.
@end table

Transient's predecessor bound @kbd{q} instead of @kbd{C-g} to the quit command.
To learn how to get that binding back see @code{transient-bind-q-to-quit}'s
doc string.

@table @asis
@kindex C-q
@findex transient-quit-all
@item @kbd{C-q} @tie{}@tie{}@tie{}@tie{}(@code{transient-quit-all})

This command quits the currently active incomplete key sequence, if
any, and all transients, including the active transient and all
suspended transients, if any.

@kindex C-z
@findex transient-suspend
@item @kbd{C-z} @tie{}@tie{}@tie{}@tie{}(@code{transient-suspend})

Like @code{transient-quit-all}, this command quits an incomplete key
sequence, if any, and all transients.  Additionally, it saves the
stack of transients so that it can easily be resumed (which is
particularly useful if you quickly need to do ``something else'', and
the stack is deeper than a single transient, and/or you have already
changed the values of some infix arguments).

Note that only a single stack of transients can be saved at a time.
If another stack is already saved, then saving a new stack discards
the previous stack.

@kindex M-x transient-resume
@findex transient-resume
@item @kbd{M-x transient-resume} @tie{}@tie{}@tie{}@tie{}(@code{transient-resume})

This command resumes the previously suspended stack of transients,
if any.
@end table

@node Common Suffix Commands
@section Common Suffix Commands
@cindex common suffix commands

A few shared suffix commands are available in all transients.  These
suffix commands are not shown in the popup buffer by default.

This includes the aborting commands mentioned in the previous section, as
well as some other commands that are all bound to @kbd{C-x @var{key}}.  After
@kbd{C-x} is pressed, a section featuring all these common commands is
temporarily shown in the popup buffer.  After invoking one of them,
the section disappears again.  Note, however, that one of these commands
is described as ``Show common permanently''; invoke that if you want the
common commands to always be shown for all transients.

@table @asis
@kindex C-x t
@findex transient-toggle-common
@item @kbd{C-x t} @tie{}@tie{}@tie{}@tie{}(@code{transient-toggle-common})

This command toggles whether the generic commands that are common to
all transients are always displayed or only after typing the
incomplete prefix key sequence @kbd{C-x}.  This only affects the current
Emacs session.

@end table

@defopt transient-show-common-commands

This option controls whether shared suffix commands are shown
alongside the transient-specific infix and suffix commands.  By
default, the shared commands are not shown to avoid overwhelming
the user with too many options.

While a transient is active, pressing @kbd{C-x} always shows the common
commands.  The value of this option can be changed for the current
Emacs session by typing @kbd{C-x t} while a transient is active.
@end defopt

The other common commands are described in either the previous or
in one of the following sections.

Some of Transient's key bindings differ from the respective bindings
of Magit-Popup; see @ref{FAQ} for more information.

@node Saving Values
@section Saving Values
@cindex saving values of arguments

After setting the infix arguments in a transient, the user can save
those arguments for future invocations.

Most transients will start out with the saved arguments when they are
invoked.  There are a few exceptions, though.  Some transients are
designed so that the value that they use is stored externally as the
buffer-local value of some variable.  Invoking such a transient again
uses the buffer-local value.@footnote{
@code{magit-diff} and @code{magit-log} are two prominent examples, and their
handling of buffer-local values is actually a bit more complicated
than outlined above and even customizable.}

If the user does not save the value and just exits using a regular
suffix command, then the value is merely saved to the transient's
history.  That value won't be used when the transient is next invoked,
but it is easily accessible (@pxref{Using History}).

@table @asis
@kindex C-x s
@findex transient-set
@item @kbd{C-x s} @tie{}@tie{}@tie{}@tie{}(@code{transient-set})

This command saves the value of the active transient for this Emacs
session.

@kindex C-x C-s
@findex transient-save
@item @kbd{C-x C-s} @tie{}@tie{}@tie{}@tie{}(@code{transient-save})

Save the value of the active transient persistently across Emacs
sessions.

@end table

@defopt transient-values-file

This option names the file that is used to persist the values of
transients between Emacs sessions.
@end defopt

@node Using History
@section Using History
@cindex value history

Every time the user invokes a suffix command the transient's current
value is saved to its history.  These values can be cycled through the
same way one can cycle through the history of commands that read
user-input in the minibuffer.

@table @asis
@kindex C-M-p
@findex transient-history-prev
@item @kbd{C-M-p} @tie{}@tie{}@tie{}@tie{}(@code{transient-history-prev})
@kindex C-x p
@findex transient-history-prev
@item @kbd{C-x p} @tie{}@tie{}@tie{}@tie{}(@code{transient-history-prev})

This command switches to the previous value used for the active
transient.

@kindex C-M-n
@findex transient-history-next
@item @kbd{C-M-n} @tie{}@tie{}@tie{}@tie{}(@code{transient-history-next})
@kindex C-x n
@findex transient-history-next
@item @kbd{C-x n} @tie{}@tie{}@tie{}@tie{}(@code{transient-history-next})

This command switches to the next value used for the active
transient.
@end table

In addition to the transient-wide history, Transient of course
supports per-infix history.  When an infix reads user-input using the
minibuffer, the user can use the regular minibuffer history
commands to cycle through previously used values.  Usually the same
keys as those mentioned above are bound to those commands.

Authors of transients should arrange for different infix commands that
read the same kind of value to also use the same history key
(@pxref{Suffix Slots}).

Both kinds of history are saved to a file when Emacs is exited.

@defopt transient-history-file

This option names the file that is used to persist the history of
transients and their infixes between Emacs sessions.
@end defopt

@defopt transient-history-limit

This option controls how many history elements are kept at the time
the history is saved in @code{transient-history-file}.
@end defopt

@node Getting Help for Suffix Commands
@section Getting Help for Suffix Commands
@cindex getting help

Transients can have many suffixes and infixes that the user might not
be familiar with.  To make it trivial to get help for these, Transient
provides access to the documentation directly from the active
transient.

@table @asis
@kindex C-h
@findex transient-help
@item @kbd{C-h} @tie{}@tie{}@tie{}@tie{}(@code{transient-help})

This command enters help mode.  When help mode is active,
typing a key shows information about the suffix command that the key
is normally bound to (instead of invoking it).  Pressing @kbd{C-h} a
second time shows information about the @emph{prefix} command.

After typing a key, the stack of transient states is suspended and
information about the suffix command is shown instead.  Typing @kbd{q} in
the help buffer buries that buffer and resumes the transient state.
@end table

What sort of documentation is shown depends on how the transient was
defined.  For infix commands that represent command-line arguments
this ideally shows the appropriate manpage.  @code{transient-help} then tries
to jump to the correct location within that.  Info manuals are also
supported.  The fallback is to show the command's doc string, for
non-infix suffixes this is usually appropriate.

@node Enabling and Disabling Suffixes
@section Enabling and Disabling Suffixes
@cindex enabling suffixes
@cindex disabling suffixes

The user base of a package that uses transients can be very diverse.
This is certainly the case for Magit; some users have been using it and
Git for a decade, while others are just getting started now.

@cindex levels
For that reason a mechanism is needed that authors can use to classify a
transient's infixes and suffixes along the essentials@dots{}everything
spectrum.  We use the term @dfn{levels} to describe that mechanism.

@cindex transient-level
Each suffix command is placed on a level and each transient has a
level (called @dfn{transient-level}), which controls which suffix commands
are available.  Integers between 1 and 7 (inclusive) are valid levels.
For suffixes, 0 is also valid; it means that the suffix is not
displayed at any level.

The levels of individual transients and/or their individual suffixes
can be changed interactively, by invoking the transient and then
pressing @kbd{C-x l} to enter the ``edit'' mode, see below.

The default level for both transients and their suffixes is 4.  The
@code{transient-default-level} option only controls the default for
transients.  The default suffix level is always 4.  The authors of
transients should place certain suffixes on a higher level, if they
expect that it won't be of use to most users, and they should place
very important suffixes on a lower level, so that they remain
available even if the user lowers the transient level.

@defopt transient-default-level

This option controls which suffix levels are made available by
default.  It sets the transient-level for transients for which the
user has not set that individually.
@end defopt

@defopt transient-levels-file

This option names the file that is used to persist the levels of
transients and their suffixes between Emacs sessions.
@end defopt

@table @asis
@kindex C-x l
@findex transient-set-level
@item @kbd{C-x l} @tie{}@tie{}@tie{}@tie{}(@code{transient-set-level})

This command enters edit mode.  When edit mode is active, then all
infixes and suffixes that are currently usable are displayed along
with their levels.  The colors of the levels indicate whether they
are enabled or not.  The level of the transient is also displayed
along with some usage information.

In edit mode, pressing the key that would usually invoke a certain
suffix instead prompts the user for the level that suffix should be
placed on.

Help mode is available in edit mode.

To change the transient level press @kbd{C-x l} again.

To exit edit mode press @kbd{C-g}.

Note that edit mode does not display any suffixes that are not
currently usable.  @code{magit-rebase}, for example, shows different suffixes
depending on whether a rebase is already in progress or not.  The
predicates also apply in edit mode.

Therefore, to control which suffixes are available given a certain
state, you have to make sure that that state is currently active.
@end table

@node Other Commands
@section Other Commands

When invoking a transient in a small frame, the transient window may
not show the complete buffer, making it necessary to scroll, using the
following commands.  These commands are never shown in the transient
window, and the key bindings are the same as for @code{scroll-up-command} and
@code{scroll-down-command} in other buffers.

@findex transient-scroll-up arg
@deffn Command transient-scroll-up arg

This command scrolls text of transient popup window upward @var{arg}
lines.  If @var{arg} is @code{nil}, then it scrolls near full screen.  This
is a wrapper around @code{scroll-up-command} (which see).
@end deffn

@findex transient-scroll-down arg
@deffn Command transient-scroll-down arg

This command scrolls text of transient popup window down @var{arg}
lines.  If @var{arg} is @code{nil}, then it scrolls near full screen.  This
is a wrapper around @code{scroll-down-command} (which see).
@end deffn

@node Other Options
@section Other Options

@defopt transient-show-popup

This option controls whether the current transient's infix and
suffix commands are shown in the popup buffer.

@itemize
@item
If @code{t} (the default) then the popup buffer is shown as soon as a
transient prefix command is invoked.


@item
If @code{nil}, then the popup buffer is not shown unless the user
explicitly requests it, by pressing an incomplete prefix key
sequence.


@item
If a number, then the a brief one-line summary is shown instead of
the popup buffer.  If zero or negative, then not even that summary
is shown; only the pressed key itself is shown.

The popup is shown when the user explicitly requests it by
pressing an incomplete prefix key sequence.  Unless this is zero,
the popup is shown after that many seconds of inactivity
(using the absolute value).
@end itemize
@end defopt

@defopt transient-enable-popup-navigation

This option controls whether navigation commands are enabled in the
transient popup buffer.

While a transient is active the transient popup buffer is not the
current buffer, making it necessary to use dedicated commands to act
on that buffer itself.  This is disabled by default.  If this option
is non-nil, then the following features are available:

@itemize
@item
@key{UP} moves the cursor to the previous suffix.
@key{DOWN} moves the cursor to the next suffix.
@key{RET} invokes the suffix the cursor is on.

@item
@key{mouse-1} invokes the clicked on suffix.

@item
@kbd{C-s} and @kbd{C-r} start isearch in the popup buffer.
@end itemize
@end defopt

@defopt transient-display-buffer-action

This option specifies the action used to display the transient popup
buffer.  The transient popup buffer is displayed in a window using
@code{(display-buffer @var{buffer} transient-display-buffer-action)}.

The value of this option has the form @code{(@var{function} . @var{alist})},
where @var{function} is a function or a list of functions.  Each such
function should accept two arguments: a buffer to display and an
alist of the same form as @var{alist}.  @xref{Choosing Window,,,elisp,},
for details.

The default is:

@lisp
(display-buffer-in-side-window
  (side . bottom)
  (inhibit-same-window . t)
  (window-parameters (no-other-window . t)))
@end lisp

This displays the window at the bottom of the selected frame.
Another useful @var{function} is @code{display-buffer-below-selected}, which
is what @code{magit-popup} used by default.  For more alternatives see
@ref{Buffer Display Action Functions,,,elisp,}, and see @ref{Buffer Display
Action Alists,,,elisp,}.

Note that the buffer that was current before the transient buffer
is shown should remain the current buffer.  Many suffix commands
act on the thing at point, if appropriate, and if the transient
buffer became the current buffer, then that would change what is
at point.  To that effect @code{inhibit-same-window} ensures that the
selected window is not used to show the transient buffer.

It may be possible to display the window in another frame, but
whether that works in practice depends on the window-manager.
If the window manager selects the new window (Emacs frame),
then that unfortunately changes which buffer is current.

If you change the value of this option, then you might also
want to change the value of @code{transient-mode-line-format}.
@end defopt

@defopt transient-mode-line-format

This option controls whether the transient popup buffer has a
mode-line, separator line, or neither.

If @code{nil}, then the buffer has no mode-line.  If the buffer is not
displayed right above the echo area, then this probably is not a
good value.

If @code{line} (the default), then the buffer also has no mode-line, but a
thin line is drawn instead, using the background color of the face
@code{transient-separator}.  Text-mode frames cannot display thin lines, and
therefore fall back to treating @code{line} like @code{nil}.

Otherwise this can be any mode-line format.  @xref{Mode Line
Format,,,elisp,}, for details.
@end defopt

@defopt transient-read-with-initial-input

This option controls whether the last history element is used as the
initial minibuffer input when reading the value of an infix argument
from the user.  If @code{nil}, there is no initial input and the first
element has to be accessed the same way as the older elements.
@end defopt

@defopt transient-highlight-mismatched-keys

This option controls whether key bindings of infix commands that do
not match the respective command-line argument should be highlighted.
For other infix commands this option has no effect.

When this option is non-@code{nil}, the key binding for an infix argument
is highlighted when only a long argument (e.g., @code{--verbose}) is
specified but no shorthand (e.g., @code{-v}).  In the rare case that a
shorthand is specified but the key binding does not match, then it
is highlighted differently.

Highlighting mismatched key bindings is useful when learning the
arguments of the underlying command-line tool; you wouldn't want to
learn any short-hands that do not actually exist.

The highlighting is done using one of the faces
@code{transient-mismatched-key} and @code{transient-nonstandard-key}.
@end defopt

@defopt transient-substitute-key-function

This function is used to modify key bindings.  If the value of this
option is @code{nil} (the default), then no substitution is performed.

This function is called with one argument, the prefix object, and
must return a key binding description, either the existing key
description it finds in the @code{key} slot, or the key description that
replaces the prefix key.  It could be used to make other
substitutions, but that is discouraged.

For example, @kbd{=} is hard to reach using my custom keyboard layout,
so I substitute @kbd{(} for that, which is easy to reach using a layout
optimized for lisp.

@lisp
(setq transient-substitute-key-function
      (lambda (obj)
        (let ((key (oref obj key)))
          (if (string-match "\\`\\(=\\)[a-zA-Z]" key)
              (replace-match "(" t t key 1)
            key))))
@end lisp
@end defopt

@defopt transient-detect-key-conflicts

This option controls whether key binding conflicts should be
detected at the time the transient is invoked.  If so, this
results in an error, which prevents the transient from being used.
Because of that, conflicts are ignored by default.

Conflicts cannot be determined earlier, i.e.@: when the transient is
being defined and when new suffixes are being added, because at that
time there can be false-positives.  It is actually valid for
multiple suffixes to share a common key binding, provided the
predicates of those suffixes prevent that more than one of them is
enabled at a time.
@end defopt

@defopt transient-force-fixed-pitch

This option controls whether to force the use of a monospaced font
in popup buffer.  Even if you use a proportional font for the
@code{default} face, you might still want to use a monospaced font in
transient's popup buffer.  Setting this option to @code{t} causes @code{default}
to be remapped to @code{fixed-pitch} in that buffer.

@node Modifying Existing Transients
@chapter Modifying Existing Transients
@cindex modifying existing transients

To an extent, transients can be customized interactively, see @ref{Enabling and Disabling Suffixes}.  This section explains how existing transients
can be further modified non-interactively.

The following functions share a few arguments:

@itemize
@item
@var{prefix} is a transient prefix command, a symbol.


@item
@var{suffix} is a transient infix or suffix specification in the same form
as expected by @code{transient-define-prefix}.  Note that an infix is a
special kind of suffix.  Depending on context ``suffixes'' means
``suffixes (including infixes)'' or ``non-infix suffixes''.  Here it
means the former.  @xref{Suffix Specifications}.

@var{suffix} may also be a group in the same form as expected by
@code{transient-define-prefix}.  @xref{Group Specifications}.


@item
@var{loc} is a command, a key vector, a key description (a string as
returned by @code{key-description}), or a list specifying coordinates (the
last element may also be a command or key).  For example @code{(1 0 -1)}
identifies the last suffix (@code{-1}) of the first subgroup (@code{0}) of the
second group (@code{1}).

If @var{loc} is a list of coordinates, then it can be used to identify a
group, not just an individual suffix command.

The function @code{transient-get-suffix} can be useful to determine whether
a certain coordination list identifies the suffix or group that you
expect it to identify.  In hairy cases it may be necessary to look
at the definition of the transient prefix command.
@end itemize

These functions operate on the information stored in the
@code{transient--layout} property of the @var{prefix} symbol.  Suffix entries in
that tree are not objects but have the form @code{(@var{level}
@var{class} @var{plist})}, where
@var{plist} should set at least @code{:key}, @code{:description} and
@code{:command}.

@defun transient-insert-suffix prefix loc suffix

This function inserts suffix or group @var{suffix} into @var{prefix}
before @var{loc}.
@end defun

@defun transient-append-suffix prefix loc suffix

This function inserts suffix or group @var{suffix} into @var{prefix}
after @var{loc}.
@end defun

@defun transient-replace-suffix prefix loc suffix

This function replaces the suffix or group at @var{loc} in @var{prefix} with
suffix or group @var{suffix}.
@end defun

@defun transient-remove-suffix prefix loc

This function removes the suffix or group at @var{loc} in @var{prefix}.
@end defun

@defun transient-get-suffix prefix loc

This function returns the suffix or group at @var{loc} in @var{prefix}.  The
returned value has the form mentioned above.
@end defun

@defun transient-suffix-put prefix loc prop value

This function edits the suffix or group at @var{loc} in @var{prefix},
by setting the @var{prop} of its plist to @var{value}.
@end defun

Most of these functions do not signal an error if they cannot perform
the requested modification.  The functions that insert new suffixes
show a warning if @var{loc} cannot be found in @var{prefix}, without
signaling an error.  The reason for doing it like this is that
establishing a key binding (and that is what we essentially are trying
to do here) should not prevent the rest of the configuration from
loading.  Among these functions only @code{transient-get-suffix} and
@code{transient-suffix-put} may signal an error.

@node Defining Transients
@section Defining Transients

A transient consists of a prefix command and at least one suffix
command, though usually a transient has several infix and suffix
commands.  The below macro defines the transient prefix command @strong{and}
binds the transient's infix and suffix commands.  In other words, it
defines the complete transient, not just the transient prefix command
that is used to invoke that transient.

@defmac transient-define-prefix name arglist [docstring] [keyword value]@dots{} group@dots{} [body@dots{}]

This macro defines @var{name} as a transient prefix command and binds the
transient's infix and suffix commands.

@var{arglist} are the arguments that the prefix command takes.
@var{docstring} is the documentation string and is optional.

These arguments can optionally be followed by keyword-value pairs.
Each key has to be a keyword symbol, either @code{:class} or a keyword
argument supported by the constructor of that class.  The
@code{transient-prefix} class is used if the class is not specified
explicitly.

@var{group}s add key bindings for infix and suffix commands and specify
how these bindings are presented in the popup buffer.  At least one
@var{group} has to be specified.  @xref{Binding Suffix and Infix Commands}.

The @var{body} is optional.  If it is omitted, then @var{arglist} is ignored and
the function definition becomes:

@lisp
(lambda ()
  (interactive)
  (transient-setup 'NAME))
@end lisp

If @var{body} is specified, then it must begin with an @code{interactive} form
that matches @var{arglist}, and it must call @code{transient-setup}.  It may,
however, call that function only when some condition is satisfied.

@cindex scope of a transient
All transients have a (possibly @code{nil}) value, which is exported when
suffix commands are called, so that they can consume that value.
For some transients it might be necessary to have a sort of
secondary value, called a ``scope''.  Such a scope would usually be
set in the command's @code{interactive} form and has to be passed to the
setup function:

@lisp
(transient-setup 'NAME nil nil :scope SCOPE)
@end lisp

For example, the scope of the @code{magit-branch-configure} transient is
the branch whose variables are being configured.
@end defmac

@node Binding Suffix and Infix Commands
@section Binding Suffix and Infix Commands

The macro @code{transient-define-prefix} is used to define a transient.
This defines the actual transient prefix command (@pxref{Defining
Transients}) and adds the transient's infix and suffix bindings, as
described below.

Users and third-party packages can add additional bindings using
functions such as @code{transient-insert-suffix} (@pxref{Modifying
Existing Transients}).  These functions take a ``suffix
specification'' as one of their arguments, which has the same form as
the specifications used in @code{transient-define-prefix}.

@menu
* Group Specifications::
* Suffix Specifications::
@end menu

@node Group Specifications
@subsection Group Specifications
@cindex group specifications

The suffix and infix commands of a transient are organized in groups.
The grouping controls how the descriptions of the suffixes are
outlined visually but also makes it possible to set certain properties
for a set of suffixes.

Several group classes exist, some of which organize suffixes in
subgroups.  In most cases the class does not have to be specified
explicitly, but see @ref{Group Classes}.

Groups are specified in the call to @code{transient-define-prefix}, using
vectors.  Because groups are represented using vectors, we cannot use
square brackets to indicate an optional element and instead use curly
brackets to do the latter.

Group specifications then have this form:

@lisp
[@{@var{level}@} @{@var{description}@}
 @{@var{keyword} @var{value}@}...
 @var{element}...]
@end lisp

The @var{level} is optional and defaults to 4.  @xref{Enabling and
Disabling Suffixes}.

The @var{description} is optional.  If present, it is used as the heading of
the group.

The @var{keyword}-@var{value} pairs are optional.  Each keyword has to be a
keyword symbol, either @code{:class} or a keyword argument supported by the
constructor of that class.

@itemize
@item
One of these keywords, @code{:description}, is equivalent to specifying
@var{description} at the very beginning of the vector.  The recommendation
is to use @code{:description} if some other keyword is also used, for
consistency, or @var{description} otherwise, because it looks better.

@item
Likewise @code{:level} is equivalent to @var{level}.

@item
Other important keywords include the @code{:if...} keywords.  These
keywords control whether the group is available in a certain
situation.

For example, one group of the @code{magit-rebase} transient uses
@code{:if magit-rebase-in-progress-p}, which contains the suffixes
that are useful while rebase is already in progress; and another that uses
@code{:if-not magit-rebase-in-progress-p}, which contains the suffixes that
initiate a rebase.

These predicates can also be used on individual suffixes and are
only documented once, see @ref{Predicate Slots}.

@item
The value of @code{:hide}, if non-@code{nil}, is a predicate that controls
whether the group is hidden by default.  The key bindings for
suffixes of a hidden group should all use the same prefix key.
Pressing that prefix key should temporarily show the group and its
suffixes, which assumes that a predicate like this is used:

@lisp
(lambda ()
  (eq (car transient--redisplay-key)
      ?\C-c)) ; the prefix key shared by all bindings
@end lisp

@item
The value of @code{:setup-children}, if non-@code{nil}, is a function
that takes two arguments the group object itself and a list of children.
The children are given as a, potentially empty, list consisting
of either group or suffix specifications.  It can make arbitrary
changes to the children including constructing new children from
scratch.  Also see @code{transient-setup-children}.

@item
The boolean @code{:pad-keys} argument controls whether keys of all suffixes
contained in a group are right padded, effectively aligning the
descriptions.
@end itemize

The @var{element}s are either all subgroups (vectors), or all suffixes
(lists) and strings.  (At least currently no group type exists that
would allow mixing subgroups with commands at the same level, though
in principle there is nothing that prevents that.)

If the @var{element}s are not subgroups, then they can be a mixture of lists
that specify commands and strings.  Strings are inserted verbatim.
The empty string can be used to insert gaps between suffixes, which is
particularly useful if the suffixes are outlined as a table.

Variables are supported inside group specifications.  For example in
place of a direct subgroup specification, a variable can be used whose
value is a vector that qualifies as a group specification.  Likewise, a
variable can be used where a suffix specification is expected.  Lists
of group or suffix specifications are also supported.  Indirect
specifications are resolved when the transient prefix is being
defined.

The form of suffix specifications is documented in the next node.

@node Suffix Specifications
@subsection Suffix Specifications
@cindex suffix specifications

A transient's suffix and infix commands are bound when the transient
prefix command is defined using @code{transient-define-prefix}, see
@ref{Defining Transients}.  The commands are organized into groups, see
@ref{Group Specifications}.  Here we describe the form used to bind an
individual suffix command.

The same form is also used when later binding additional commands
using functions such as @code{transient-insert-suffix},
see @ref{Modifying Existing Transients}.

Note that an infix is a special kind of suffix.  Depending on context
``suffixes'' means ``suffixes (including infixes)'' or ``non-infix
suffixes''.  Here it means the former.

Suffix specifications have this form:

@lisp
([@var{level}]
 [@var{key}] [@var{description}]
 @var{command}|@var{argument} [@var{keyword} @var{value}]...)
@end lisp

@var{level}, @var{key} and @var{description} can also be specified using the @var{keyword}s
@code{:level}, @code{:key} and @code{:description}.  If the object that is associated with
@var{command} sets these properties, then they do not have to be specified
here.  You can however specify them here anyway, possibly overriding
the object's values just for the binding inside this transient.

@itemize
@item
@var{level} is the suffix level, an integer between 1 and 7.
@xref{Enabling and Disabling Suffixes}.

@item
@var{key} is the key binding, either a vector or key description string.

@item
@var{description} is the description, either a string or a function that
returns a string.  The function should be a lambda expression to
avoid ambiguity.  In some cases a symbol that is bound as a function
would also work but to be safe you should use @code{:description} in that
case.
@end itemize

The next element is either a command or an argument.  This is the only
argument that is mandatory in all cases.

@itemize
@item
Usually @var{command} is a symbol that is bound as a function, which has
to be defined or at least autoloaded as a command by the time the
containing prefix command is invoked.

Any command will do; it does not need to have an object associated
with it (as would be the case if @code{transient-define-suffix} or
@code{transient-define-infix} were used to define it).

The command can also be a closure or lambda expression, but that
should only be used for dynamic transients whose suffixes are
defined when the prefix command is invoked.  See information about
the @code{:setup-children} function in @ref{Group Specifications}.

As mentioned above, the object that is associated with a command can
be used to set the default for certain values that otherwise have to
be set in the suffix specification.  Therefore if there is no object,
then you have to make sure to specify the @var{key} and the @var{description}.

As a special case, if you want to add a command that might be neither
defined nor autoloaded, you can use a workaround like:

@lisp
(transient-insert-suffix 'some-prefix "k"
  '("!" "Ceci n'est pas une commande" no-command
    :if (lambda () (featurep 'no-library))))
@end lisp

Instead of @code{featurep} you could also use @code{require} with a
non-nil value for @var{noerror}.

@item
The mandatory argument can also be a command-line argument, a
string.  In that case an anonymous command is defined and bound.

Instead of a string, this can also be a list of two strings, in
which case the first string is used as the short argument (which can
also be specified using @code{:shortarg}) and the second as the long argument
(which can also be specified using @code{:argument}).

Only the long argument is displayed in the popup buffer.  See
@code{transient-detect-key-conflicts} for how the short argument may be
used.

Unless the class is specified explicitly, the appropriate class is
guessed based on the long argument.  If the argument ends with @samp{=}
(e.g. @samp{--format=}) then @code{transient-option} is used, otherwise
@code{transient-switch}.
@end itemize

Finally, details can be specified using optional
@var{keyword}-@var{value} pairs.
Each keyword has to be a keyword symbol, either @code{:class} or a keyword
argument supported by the constructor of that class.  See @ref{Suffix Slots}.

@node Defining Suffix and Infix Commands
@section Defining Suffix and Infix Commands
@cindex defining suffix commands
@cindex defining infix commands

Note that an infix is a special kind of suffix.  Depending on context
``suffixes'' means ``suffixes (including infixes)'' or ``non-infix
suffixes''.

@defmac transient-define-suffix name arglist [docstring] [keyword value]@dots{} body@dots{}

This macro defines @var{name} as a transient suffix command.

@var{arglist} are the arguments that the command takes.
@var{docstring} is the documentation string and is optional.

These arguments can optionally be followed by keyword-value pairs.
Each keyword has to be a keyword symbol, either @code{:class} or a keyword
argument supported by the constructor of that class.  The
@code{transient-suffix} class is used if the class is not specified
explicitly.

The @var{body} must begin with an @code{interactive} form that matches @var{arglist}.
The infix arguments are usually accessed by using @code{transient-args}
inside @code{interactive}.
@end defmac

@defmac transient-define-infix name arglist [docstring] [keyword value]@dots{}

This macro defines @var{name} as a transient infix command.

@var{arglist} is always ignored (but mandatory never-the-less) and
reserved for future use.  @var{docstring} is the documentation string and
is optional.

The keyword-value pairs are mandatory.  All transient infix commands
are @code{equal} to each other (but not @code{eq}), so it is meaningless to define
an infix command without also setting at least @code{:class} and one other
keyword (which it is depends on the used class, usually @code{:argument} or
@code{:variable}).

Each keyword has to be a keyword symbol, either @code{:class} or a keyword
argument supported by the constructor of that class.  The
@code{transient-switch} class is used if the class is not specified
explicitly.

The function definition is always:

@lisp
(lambda ()
  (interactive)
  (let ((obj (transient-suffix-object)))
    (transient-infix-set obj (transient-infix-read obj)))
  (transient--show))
@end lisp

@code{transient-infix-read} and @code{transient-infix-set} are generic functions.
Different infix commands behave differently because the concrete
methods are different for different infix command classes.  In rare
cases the above command function might not be suitable, even if you
define your own infix command class.  In that case you have to use
@code{transient-suffix-command} to define the infix command and use @code{t} as
the value of the @code{:transient} keyword.
@end defmac

@defmac transient-define-argument name arglist [docstring] [keyword value]@dots{}

This macro defines @var{name} as a transient infix command.

This is an alias for @code{transient-define-infix}.  Only use this alias
to define an infix command that actually sets an infix argument.
To define an infix command that, for example, sets a variable, use
@code{transient-define-infix} instead.
@end defmac

@node Using Infix Arguments
@section Using Infix Arguments
@cindex using infix arguments

The functions and the variables described below allow suffix commands
to access the value of the transient from which they were invoked;
which is the value of its infix arguments.  These variables are set
when the user invokes a suffix command that exits the transient, but
before actually calling the command.

When returning to the command-loop after calling the suffix command,
the arguments are reset to @code{nil} (which causes the function to return
@code{nil} too).

Like for Emacs' prefix arguments, it is advisable, but not mandatory,
to access the infix arguments inside the command's @code{interactive} form.
The preferred way of doing that is to call the @code{transient-args}
function, which for infix arguments serves about the same purpose as
@code{prefix-arg} serves for prefix arguments.

@defun transient-args prefix

This function returns the value of the transient prefix command
@var{prefix}.

If the current command was invoked from the transient prefix command
@var{prefix}, then it returns the active infix arguments.  If the current
command was not invoked from @var{prefix}, then it returns the set, saved
or default value for @var{prefix}.
@end defun

@defun transient-arg-value arg args

This function return the value of @var{arg} as it appears in @var{args}.

For a switch a boolean is returned.  For an option the value is
returned as a string, using the empty string for the empty value,
or @code{nil} if the option does not appear in @var{args}.
@end defun

@defun transient-suffixes prefix

This function returns the suffixes of the transient prefix command
@var{prefix}.  This is a list of objects.  This function should only be
used if you need the objects (as opposed to just their values) and
if the current command is not being invoked from @var{prefix}.
@end defun

@defvar transient-current-suffixes

The suffixes of the transient from which this suffix command was
invoked.  This is a list of objects.  Usually it is sufficient to
instead use the function @code{transient-args}, which returns a list of
values.  In complex cases it might be necessary to use this variable
instead, i.e.@: if you need access to information beside the value.
@end defvar

@defvar transient-current-prefix

The transient from which this suffix command was invoked.  The
returned value is a @code{transient-prefix} object, which holds information
associated with the transient prefix command.
@end defvar

@defvar transient-current-command

The transient from which this suffix command was invoked.  The
returned value is a symbol, the transient prefix command.
@end defvar

@node Transient State
@section Transient State
@cindex transient state

Invoking a transient prefix command ``activates'' the respective
transient, i.e.@: it puts a transient keymap into effect, which binds
the transient's infix and suffix commands.

The default behavior while a transient is active is as follows:

@itemize
@item
Invoking an infix command does not affect the transient state; the
transient remains active.

@item
Invoking a (non-infix) suffix command ``deactivates'' the transient
state by removing the transient keymap and performing some
additional cleanup.

@item
Invoking a command that is bound in a keymap other than the
transient keymap is disallowed and trying to do so results in a
warning.  This does not ``deactivate'' the transient.
@end itemize

But these are just the defaults.  Whether a certain command
deactivates or ``exits'' the transient is configurable.  There is more
than one way in which a command can be ``transient'' or ``non-transient'';
the exact behavior is implemented by calling a so-called ``pre-command''
function.  Whether non-suffix commands are allowed to be called is
configurable per transient.

@itemize
@item
The transient-ness of suffix commands (including infix commands) is
controlled by the value of their @code{transient} slot, which can be set
either when defining the command or when adding a binding to a
transient while defining the respective transient prefix command.

Valid values are booleans and the pre-commands described below.

@itemize
@item
@code{t} is equivalent to @code{transient--do-stay}.

@item
@code{nil} is equivalent to @code{transient--do-exit}.

@item
If @code{transient} is unbound (and that is actually the default for
non-infix suffixes) then the value of the prefix's
@code{transient-suffix} slot is used instead.  The default value of that
slot is @code{nil}, so the suffix's @code{transient} slot being unbound is
essentially equivalent to it being @code{nil}.
@end itemize

@item
A suffix command can be a prefix command itself, i.e. a
``sub-prefix''.  While a sub-prefix is active we nearly always want
@kbd{C-g} to take the user back to the ``super-prefix''.  However in rare
cases this may not be desirable, and that makes the following
complication necessary:

For @code{transient-suffix} objects the @code{transient} slot is unbound.  We can
ignore that for the most part because, as stated above, @code{nil} and the
slot being unbound are equivalent, and mean ``do exit''.  That isn't
actually true for suffixes that are sub-prefixes though.  For such
suffixes unbound means ``do exit but allow going back'', which is the
default, while @code{nil} means ``do exit permanently'', which requires that
slot to be explicitly set to that value.

@item
The transient-ness of certain built-in suffix commands is specified
using @code{transient-predicate-map}.  This is a special keymap, which
binds commands to pre-commands (as opposed to keys to commands) and
takes precedence over the @code{transient} slot.
@end itemize

The available pre-command functions are documented below.  They are
called by @code{transient--pre-command}, a function on @code{pre-command-hook} and
the value that they return determines whether the transient is exited.
To do so the value of one of the constants @code{transient--exit} or
@code{transient--stay} is used (that way we don't have to remember if @code{t} means
``exit'' or ``stay'').

Additionally, these functions may change the value of @code{this-command}
(which explains why they have to be called using @code{pre-command-hook}),
call @code{transient-export}, @code{transient--stack-zap} or @code{transient--stack-push};
and set the values of @code{transient--exitp}, @code{transient--helpp} or
@code{transient--editp}.

@anchor{Pre-commands for Infixes}
@subheading Pre-commands for Infixes

The default for infixes is @code{transient--do-stay}.  This is also the only
function that makes sense for infixes.

@defun transient--do-stay

Call the command without exporting variables and stay transient.
@end defun

@anchor{Pre-commands for Suffixes}
@subheading Pre-commands for Suffixes

The default for suffixes is @code{transient--do-exit}.

@defun transient--do-exit

Call the command after exporting variables and exit the transient.
@end defun

@defun transient--do-call

Call the command after exporting variables and stay transient.
@end defun

@defun transient--do-replace

Call the transient prefix command, replacing the active transient.

This is used for suffixes that are prefixes themselves, i.e.@: for
sub-prefixes.
@end defun

@anchor{Pre-commands for Non-Suffixes}
@subheading Pre-commands for Non-Suffixes

The default for non-suffixes, i.e@: commands that are bound in other
keymaps beside the transient keymap, is @code{transient--do-warn}.  Silently
ignoring the user-error is also an option, though probably not a good
one.

If you want to let the user invoke non-suffix commands, then use
@code{transient--do-stay} as the value of the prefix's @code{transient-non-suffix}
slot.

@defun transient--do-warn

Call @code{transient-undefined} and stay transient.
@end defun

@defun transient--do-noop

Call @code{transient-noop} and stay transient.
@end defun

@anchor{Special Pre-Commands}
@subheading Special Pre-Commands

@defun transient--do-quit-one

If active, quit help or edit mode, else exit the active transient.

This is used when the user pressed @kbd{C-g}.
@end defun

@defun transient--do-quit-all

Exit all transients without saving the transient stack.

This is used when the user pressed @kbd{C-q}.
@end defun

@defun transient--do-suspend

Suspend the active transient, saving the transient stack.

This is used when the user pressed @kbd{C-z}.
@end defun

@node Classes and Methods
@chapter Classes and Methods
@cindex classes and methods

Transient uses classes and generic functions to make it possible to
define new types of suffix commands that are similar to existing
types, but behave differently in some aspects.  It does the same for
groups and prefix commands, though at least for prefix commands that
@strong{currently} appears to be less important.

Every prefix, infix and suffix command is associated with an object,
which holds information that controls certain aspects of its behavior.
This happens in two ways.

@itemize
@item
Associating a command with a certain class gives the command a type.
This makes it possible to use generic functions to do certain things
that have to be done differently depending on what type of command
it acts on.

That in turn makes it possible for third-parties to add new types
without having to convince the maintainer of Transient that that new
type is important enough to justify adding a special case to a dozen
or so functions.

@item
Associating a command with an object makes it possible to easily
store information that is specific to that particular command.

Two commands may have the same type, but obviously their key
bindings and descriptions still have to be different, for example.

The values of some slots are functions.  The @code{reader} slot for example
holds a function that is used to read a new value for an infix
command.  The values of such slots are regular functions.

Generic functions are used when a function should do something
different based on the type of the command, i.e. when all commands
of a certain type should behave the same way but different from the
behavior for other types.  Object slots that hold a regular function
as value are used when the task that they perform is likely to
differ even between different commands of the same type.

@node Group Classes
@section Group Classes

The type of a group can be specified using the @code{:class} property at the
beginning of the class specification, e.g. @code{[:class transient-columns

@itemize
@item
The abstract @code{transient-child} class is the base class of both
@code{transient-group} (and therefore all groups) as well as of
@code{transient-suffix} (and therefore all suffix and infix commands).

This class exists because the elements (a.k.a.@: ``children'') of certain
groups can be other groups instead of suffix and infix commands.

@item
The abstract @code{transient-group} class is the superclass of all other
group classes.

@item
The @code{transient-column} class is the simplest group.

This is the default ``flat'' group.  If the class is not specified
explicitly and the first element is not a vector (i.e. not a group),
then this class is used.

This class displays each element on a separate line.

@item
The @code{transient-row} class displays all elements on a single line.

@item
The @code{transient-columns} class displays commands organized in columns.

Direct elements have to be groups whose elements have to be commands
or strings.  Each subgroup represents a column.  This class takes
care of inserting the subgroups' elements.

This is the default ``nested'' group.  If the class is not specified
explicitly and the first element is a vector (i.e.@: a group), then
this class is used.

@item
The @code{transient-subgroups} class wraps other groups.

Direct elements have to be groups whose elements have to be commands
or strings.  This group inserts an empty line between subgroups.
The subgroups themselves are responsible for displaying their
elements.
@end itemize

@node Group Methods
@section Group Methods

@defun transient-setup-children group children

This generic function can be used to setup the children or a group.

The default implementation usually just returns the children
unchanged, but if the @code{setup-children} slot of @var{group} is non-nil, then
it calls that function with @var{children} as the only argument and
returns the value.

The children are given as a (potentially empty) list consisting of
either group or suffix specifications.  These functions can make
arbitrary changes to the children including constructing new
children from scratch.
@end defun

@defun transient--insert-group group

This generic function formats the group and its elements and inserts
the result into the current buffer, which is a temporary buffer.
The contents of that buffer are later inserted into the popup buffer.

Functions that are called by this function may need to operate in
the buffer from which the transient was called.  To do so they can
temporarily make the @code{transient--source-buffer} the current buffer.
@end defun

@node Prefix Classes
@section Prefix Classes

Currently the @code{transient-prefix} class is being used for all prefix
commands and there is only a single generic function that can be
specialized based on the class of a prefix command.

@defun transient--history-init obj

This generic function is called while setting up the transient and
is responsible for initializing the @code{history} slot.  This is the
transient-wide history; many individual infixes also have a history
of their own.

The default (and currently only) method extracts the value from the
global variable @code{transient-history}.
@end defun

A transient prefix command's object is stored in the @code{transient--prefix}
property of the command symbol.  While a transient is active, a clone
of that object is stored in the variable @code{transient--prefix}.  A clone
is used because some changes that are made to the active transient's
object should not affect later invocations.

@node Suffix Classes
@section Suffix Classes

@itemize
@item
All suffix and infix classes derive from @code{transient-suffix}, which in
turn derives from @code{transient-child}, from which @code{transient-group} also
derives (@pxref{Group Classes}).

@item
All infix classes derive from the abstract @code{transient-infix} class,
which in turn derives from the @code{transient-suffix} class.

Infixes are a special type of suffixes.  The primary difference is
that infixes always use the @code{transient--do-stay} pre-command, while
non-infix suffixes use a variety of pre-commands (see @ref{Transient State}).  Doing that is most easily achieved by using this class,
though theoretically it would be possible to define an infix class
that does not do so.  If you do that then you get to implement many
methods.

Also, infixes and non-infix suffixes are usually defined using
different macros (@pxref{Defining Suffix and Infix Commands}).

@item
Classes used for infix commands that represent arguments should
be derived from the abstract @code{transient-argument} class.

@item
The @code{transient-switch} class (or a derived class) is used for infix
arguments that represent command-line switches (arguments that do
not take a value).

@item
The @code{transient-option} class (or a derived class) is used for infix
arguments that represent command-line options (arguments that do
take a value).

@item
The @code{transient-switches} class can be used for a set of mutually
exclusive command-line switches.

@item
The @code{transient-files} class can be used for a @samp{--} argument that
indicates that all remaining arguments are files.

@item
Classes used for infix commands that represent variables should
derived from the abstract @code{transient-variables} class.
@end itemize

Magit defines additional classes, which can serve as examples for the
fancy things you can do without modifying Transient.  Some of these
classes will likely get generalized and added to Transient.  For now
they are very much subject to change and not documented.

@node Suffix Methods
@section Suffix Methods

To get information about the methods implementing these generic
functions use @code{describe-function}.

@menu
* Suffix Value Methods::
* Suffix Format Methods::
@end menu

@node Suffix Value Methods
@subsection Suffix Value Methods

@defun transient-init-value obj

This generic function sets the initial value of the object @var{obj}.

This function is called for all suffix commands, but unless a
concrete method is implemented this falls through to the default
implementation, which is a noop.  In other words this usually
only does something for infix commands, but note that this is
not implemented for the abstract class @code{transient-infix}, so if
your class derives from that directly, then you must implement
a method.
@end defun

@defun transient-infix-read obj

This generic function determines the new value of the infix object
@var{obj}.

This function merely determines the value; @code{transient-infix-set} is
used to actually store the new value in the object.

For most infix classes this is done by reading a value from the
user using the reader specified by the @code{reader} slot (using the
@code{transient-infix-value} method described below).

For some infix classes the value is changed without reading
anything in the minibuffer, i.e.@: the mere act of invoking the
infix command determines what the new value should be, based
on the previous value.
@end defun

@defun transient-prompt obj

This generic function returns the prompt to be used to read infix
object @var{obj}'s value.
@end defun

@defun transient-infix-set obj value

This generic function sets the value of infix object @var{obj} to @var{value}.
@end defun

@defun transient-infix-value obj

This generic function returns the value of the suffix object @var{obj}.

This function is called by @code{transient-args} (which see), meaning this
function is how the value of a transient is determined so that the
invoked suffix command can use it.

Currently most values are strings, but that is not set in stone.
@code{nil} is not a value, it means ``no value''.

Usually only infixes have a value, but see the method for
@code{transient-suffix}.
@end defun

@defun transient-init-scope obj

This generic function sets the scope of the suffix object @var{obj}.

The scope is actually a property of the transient prefix, not of
individual suffixes.  However it is possible to invoke a suffix
command directly instead of from a transient.  In that case, if
the suffix expects a scope, then it has to determine that itself
and store it in its @code{scope} slot.

This function is called for all suffix commands, but unless a
concrete method is implemented this falls through to the default
implementation, which is a noop.
@end defun

@node Suffix Format Methods
@subsection Suffix Format Methods

@defun transient-format obj

This generic function formats and returns @var{obj} for display.

When this function is called, then the current buffer is some
temporary buffer.  If you need the buffer from which the prefix
command was invoked to be current, then do so by temporarily
making @code{transient--source-buffer} current.
@end defun

@defun transient-format-key obj

This generic function formats @var{obj}'s @code{key} for display and returns the
result.
@end defun

@defun transient-format-description obj

This generic function formats @var{obj}'s @code{description} for display and
returns the result.
@end defun

@defun transient-format-value obj

This generic function formats @var{obj}'s value for display and returns
the result.
@end defun

@defun transient-show-help obj

Show help for the prefix, infix or suffix command represented by
@var{obj}.

For prefixes, show the info manual, if that is specified using the
@code{info-manual} slot.  Otherwise, show the manpage if that is specified
using the @code{man-page} slot.  Otherwise, show the command's doc string.

For suffixes, show the command's doc string.

For infixes, show the manpage if that is specified.  Otherwise show
the command's doc string.
@end defun

@node Prefix Slots
@section Prefix Slots

@itemize
@item
@code{man-page} or @code{info-manual} can be used to specify the documentation for
the prefix and its suffixes.  The command @code{transient-help} uses the
method @code{transient-show-help} (which see) to lookup and use these
values.

@item
@code{history-key} If multiple prefix commands should share a single value,
then this slot has to be set to the same value for all of them.  You
probably don't want that.

@item
@code{transient-suffix} and @code{transient-non-suffix} play a part when
determining whether the currently active transient prefix command
remains active/transient when a suffix or abitrary non-suffix
command is invoked.  @xref{Transient State}.

@item
@code{incompatible} A list of lists.  Each sub-list specifies a set of
mutually exclusive arguments.  Enabling one of these arguments
causes the others to be disabled.  An argument may appear in
multiple sub-lists.

@item
@code{scope} For some transients it might be necessary to have a sort of
secondary value, called a ``scope''.  See @code{transient-define-prefix}.
@end itemize

@anchor{Internal Prefix Slots}
@subheading Internal Prefix Slots

These slots are mostly intended for internal use.  They should not be
set in calls to @code{transient-define-prefix}.

@itemize
@item
@code{prototype} When a transient prefix command is invoked, then a clone
of that object is stored in the global variable @code{transient--prefix}
and the prototype is stored in the clone's @code{prototype} slot.

@item
@code{command} The command, a symbol.  Each transient prefix command
consists of a command, which is stored in a symbol's function slot
and an object, which is stored in the @code{transient--prefix} property
of the same symbol.

@item
@code{level} The level of the prefix commands.  The suffix commands whose
layer is equal or lower are displayed.  @pxref{Enabling and Disabling Suffixes}.

@item
@code{value} The likely outdated value of the prefix.  Instead of accessing
this slot directly you should use the function @code{transient-get-value},
which is guaranteed to return the up-to-date value.

@item
@code{history} and @code{history-pos} are used to keep track of historic values.
Unless you implement your own @code{transient-infix-read} method you should
not have to deal with these slots.
@end itemize

@node Suffix Slots
@section Suffix Slots

Here we document most of the slots that are only available for suffix
objects.  Some slots are shared by suffix and group objects, they are
documented in @ref{Predicate Slots}.

Also see @ref{Suffix Classes}.

@anchor{Slots of @code{transient-suffix}}
@subheading Slots of @code{transient-suffix}

@itemize
@item
@code{key} The key, a key vector or a key description string.

@item
@code{command} The command, a symbol.

@item
@code{transient} Whether to stay transient.  @xref{Transient State}.

@item
@code{format} The format used to display the suffix in the popup buffer.
It must contain the following %-placeholders:

@itemize
@item
@code{%k} For the key.

@item
@code{%d} For the description.

@item
@code{%v} For the infix value.  Non-infix suffixes don't have a value.
@end itemize

@item
@code{description} The description, either a string or a function that is
called with no argument and returns a string.
@end itemize

@anchor{Slots of @code{transient-infix}}
@subheading Slots of @code{transient-infix}

Some of these slots are only meaningful for some of the subclasses.
They are defined here anyway to allow sharing certain methods.

@itemize
@item
@code{argument} The long argument, e.g. @code{--verbose}.

@item
@code{shortarg} The short argument, e.g. @code{-v}.

@item
@code{value} The value.  Should not be accessed directly.

@item
@code{init-value} Function that is responsible for setting the object's
value.  If bound, then this is called with the object as the only
argument.  Usually this is not bound, in which case the object's
primary @code{transient-init-value} method is called instead.

@item
@code{unsavable} Whether the value of the suffix is not saved as part of
the prefixes.

@item
@code{multi-value} For options, whether the option can have multiple
values.  If non-nil, then default to use @code{completing-read-multiple}.

@item
@code{always-read} For options, whether to read a value on every invocation.
If this is nil, then options that have a value are simply unset and
have to be invoked a second time to set a new value.

@item
@code{allow-empty} For options, whether the empty string is a valid value.

@item
@code{history-key} The key used to store the history.  This defaults to the
command name.  This is useful when multiple infixes should share the
same history because their values are of the same kind.

@item
@code{reader} The function used to read the value of an infix.  Not used
for switches.  The function takes three arguments, @var{prompt},
@var{initial-input} and @var{history}, and must return a string.

@item
@code{prompt} The prompt used when reading the value, either a string or a
function that takes the object as the only argument and which
returns a prompt string.

@item
@code{choices} A list of valid values.  How exactly that is used depends on
the class of the object.
@end itemize

@anchor{Slots of @code{transient-variable}}
@subheading Slots of @code{transient-variable}

@itemize
@item
@code{variable} The variable.
@end itemize

@anchor{Slots of @code{transient-switches}}
@subheading Slots of @code{transient-switches}

@itemize
@item
@code{argument-format} The display format.  Must contain @code{%s}, one of the
@code{choices} is substituted for that.  E.g., @code{--%s-order}.

@item
@code{argument-regexp} The regexp used to match any one of the switches.
E.g., @code{\\(--\\(topo\\|author-date\\|date\\)-order\\)}.
@end itemize

@node Predicate Slots
@section Predicate Slots

Suffix and group objects share some predicate slots that control
whether a group or suffix should be available depending on some state.
Only one of these slots can be used at the same time.  It is undefined
what happens if you use more than one.

@itemize
@item
@code{if} Enable if predicate returns non-@code{nil}.

@item
@code{if-not} Enable if predicate returns @code{nil}.

@item
@code{if-non-nil} Enable if variable's value is non-@code{nil}.

@item
@code{if-nil} Enable if variable's value is @code{nil}.

@item
@code{if-mode} Enable if major-mode matches value.

@item
@code{if-not-mode} Enable if major-mode does not match value.

@item
@code{if-derived} Enable if major-mode derives from value.

@item
@code{if-not-derived} Enable if major-mode does not derive from value.
@end itemize

One more slot is shared between group and suffix classes, @code{level}.  Like
the slots documented above, it is a predicate, but it is used for a
different purpose.  The value has to be an integer between 1
and 7.  @code{level} controls whether a suffix or a group should be
available depending on user preference.

@end example

@itemize
@item
@code{@{1@}} Transients can be configured to be exited when a suffix command
is invoked.  The default is to do so for all suffixes except for
those that are common to all transients and which are used to
perform tasks such as providing help and saving the value of the
infix arguments for future invocations.  The behavior can also be
specified for individual suffix commands and may even depend on
state.

@item
@code{@{2@}} Transients can be configured to allow the user to invoke
non-suffix commands.  The default is to not allow that and instead
warn the user.
@end itemize

Despite already being rather complex, even the last diagram leaves out
many details.  Most importantly it implies that the decision whether
to remain transient is made later than it actually is made (for the
most part a function on @code{pre-command-hook} is responsible).  But such
implementation details are of little relevance to users and are
covered elsewhere.

@node Comparison With Other Packages
@section Comparison With Other Packages

@anchor{Magit-Popup}
@subheading Magit-Popup

Transient is the successor to Magit-Popup (@pxref{Top,,,magit-popup,}).

One major difference between these two implementations of the same
ideas is that while Transient uses transient keymaps and embraces the
command-loop, Magit-Popup implemented an inferior mechanism that does
not use transient keymaps and that instead of using the command-loop
implements a naive alternative based on @code{read-char}.

Magit-Popup does not use classes and generic functions and defining a
new command type is near impossible as it involves adding hard-coded
special-cases to many functions.  Because of that only a single new
type was added, which was not already part of Magit-Popup's initial
release.

A lot of things are hard-coded in Magit-Popup.  One random example is
that the key bindings for switches must begin with @code{-} and those for
options must begin with @code{=}.

@anchor{Hydra}
@subheading Hydra

Hydra (see @uref{https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra}) is another package that
provides features similar to those of Transient.

Both packages use transient keymaps to make a set of commands
temporarily available and show the available commands in a popup
buffer.

A Hydra ``body'' is equivalent to a Transient ``prefix'' and a Hydra
``head'' is equivalent to a Transient ``suffix''.  Hydra has no equivalent
of a Transient ``infix''.

Both hydras and transients can be used as simple command dispatchers.
Used like this they are similar to regular prefix commands and prefix
keys, except that the available commands are shown in the popup buffer.

(Another package that does this is @code{which-key}. It does so automatically
for any incomplete key sequence.  The advantage of that approach is
that no additional work is necessary; the disadvantage is that the
available commands are not organized semantically.)

Both Hydra and Transient provide features that go beyond simple
command dispatchers:

@itemize
@item
Invoking a command from a hydra does not necessarily exit the hydra.
That makes it possible to invoke the same command again, but using a
shorter key sequence (i.e. the key that was used to enter the hydra
does not have to be pressed again).

Transient supports that too, but for now this feature is not a focus
and the interface is a bit more complicated.  A very basic example
using the current interface:

@lisp
(transient-define-prefix outline-navigate ()
  :transient-suffix     'transient--do-stay
  :transient-non-suffix 'transient--do-warn
  [("p" "previous visible heading" outline-previous-visible-heading)
   ("n" "next visible heading" outline-next-visible-heading)])
@end lisp


@item
Transient supports infix arguments; values that are set by infix
commands and then consumed by the invoked suffix command(s).

To my knowledge, Hydra does not support that.
@end itemize

Both packages make it possible to specify how exactly the available
commands are outlined:

@itemize
@item
With Hydra this is often done using an explicit format string, which
gives authors a lot of flexibility and makes it possible to do fancy
things.

The downside of this is that it becomes harder for a user to add
additional commands to an existing hydra and to change key bindings.

@item
Transient allows the author of a transient to organize the commands
into groups and the use of generic functions allows authors of
transients to control exactly how a certain command type is
displayed.

However while Transient supports giving sections a heading it does
not currently support giving the displayed information more
structure by, for example, using box-drawing characters.

That could be implemented by defining a new group class, which lets
the author specify a format string.  It should be possible to
implement that without modifying any existing code, but it does not
currently exist.

@node FAQ
@appendix FAQ



@anchor{Can I control how the popup buffer is displayed?}
@appendixsec Can I control how the popup buffer is displayed?

Yes, see @code{transient-display-buffer-action} in @ref{Other Options}.

@anchor{Why did some of the key bindings change?}
@appendixsec Why did some of the key bindings change?

You may have noticed that the bindings for some of the common commands
do @strong{not} have the prefix @code{C-x} and that furthermore some of these commands
are grayed out while others are not.  That unfortunately is a bit
confusing if the section of common commands is not shown permanently,
making the following explanation necessary.

The purpose of usually hiding that section but showing it after the
user pressed the respective prefix key is to conserve space and not
overwhelm users with too much noise, while allowing the user to
quickly list common bindings on demand.

That however should not keep us from using the best possible key
bindings.  The bindings that do use a prefix do so to avoid wasting
too many non-prefix bindings, keeping them available for use in
individual transients.  The bindings that do not use a prefix and that
are @strong{not} grayed out are very important bindings that are @strong{always}
available, even when invoking the ``common command key prefix'' or @strong{any
other} transient-specific prefix.  The non-prefix keys that @strong{are} grayed
out however, are not available when any incomplete prefix key sequence
is active.  They do not use the ``common command key prefix'' because it
is likely that users want to invoke them several times in a row and
e.g. @kbd{M-p M-p M-p} is much more convenient than
@kbd{C-x M-p C-x M-p C-x M-p}.

You may also have noticed that the "Set" command is bound to @kbd{C-x s},
while Magit-Popup used to bind @kbd{C-c C-c} instead.  I have seen several
users praise the latter binding (sic), so I did not change it
willy-nilly.  The reason that I changed it is that using different
prefix keys for different common commands, would have made the
temporary display of the common commands even more confusing,
i.e. after pressing @kbd{C-c} all the @kbd{C-x ...} bindings would be grayed out.

Using a single prefix for common commands key means that all other
potential prefix keys can be used for transient-specific commands
@strong{without} the section of common commands also popping up.  @code{C-c} in
particular is a prefix that I want to (and already do) use for Magit, and
also using that for a common command would prevent me from doing so.

(Also see the next question.)

@anchor{Why does @code{q} not quit popups anymore?}
@appendixsec Why does @code{q} not quit popups anymore?

I agree that @kbd{q} is a good binding for commands that quit something.
This includes quitting whatever transient is currently active, but it
also includes quitting whatever it is that some specific transient is
controlling.  The transient @code{magit-blame} for example binds @code{q} to the
command that turns @code{magit-blame-mode} off.

So I had to decide if @kbd{q} should quit the active transient (like
Magit-Popup used to) or whether @kbd{C-g} should do that instead, so
that @kbd{q}
could be bound in individual transient to whatever commands make sense
for them.  Because all other letters are already reserved for use by
individual transients, I have decided to no longer make an exception
for @kbd{q}.

If you want to get @kbd{q}'s old binding back then you can do so.  Doing
that is a bit more complicated than changing a single key binding, so
I have implemented a function, @code{transient-bind-q-to-quit} that makes the
necessary changes.  See its doc string for more information.
