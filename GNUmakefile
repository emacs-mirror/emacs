# This GNUmakefile is for GNU Make.  It is for convenience, so that
# one can run 'make' in an unconfigured source tree.  In such a tree,
# this file causes GNU Make to first create a standard configuration
# with the default options, and then reinvokes itself on the
# newly-built Makefile.  If the source tree is already configured,
# this file defers to the existing Makefile.

# If you are using a non-GNU 'make', or if you want non-default build
# options, or if you want to build in an out-of-source tree, please
# run "configure" by hand.  But run autogen.sh first, if the source
# was checked out directly from the repository.

# If a Makefile already exists, just use it.
