### Commentary:

## Generate info/dir, for systems without install-info.
## Expects to be called from top-level Emacs source directory.

## It only handles the case where info/dir is missing from the
## installation directory.  It does not handle info/dir being present
## but missing some entries.

## Header contains non-printing characters, so this is more
## reliable than using awk.
