This directory tree contains a version of Emacs master branch that
implements a new garbage collector (GC) for Emacs that is based on
Ravenbrook's Memory Pool System (MPS) library.  The new GC is
concurrent, incremental, and generational.

The maintainers ask users to help the Emacs developers stabilize this
branch, so that we can merge it into the Emacs master branch faster.
That means building this branch, running it, and, crucially, reporting
any bugs that you run into to bug-gnu-emacs@gnu.org.  See the BUGS file
for more information.


Building this branch
====================

This branch can be built with and without the new GC (igc).  If you want
to build with igc, you will need to install the MPS library 'libmps'.
How to install the library differs from system to system, see
'Installing libmps' below.

How to build Emacs from a Git checkout is described in the file
INSTALL.REPO.  Everything said there applies to this branch as well.
When you have 'libmps' installed, you can configure Emacs to use it with
the new configure option '--with-mps'.

Use the following configure flags:

  --with-mps=yes	to use the production version of libmps
  --with-mps=debug      to use the debug version of libmps
  --with-mps=no         to not use MPS (or don't use '--with-mps')

In addition, you can run configure with

  --enable-checking=igc_debug

to enable igc-specific assertions.


Installing 'libmps'
===================

GNU/Linux and *BSD
------------------

See "Building MPS yourself" below.

macOS with Homebrew
-------------------

Install 'libmps' from Homebrew with

  brew install libmps

Then add something like this to your environment (e.g., to ~/.zprofile):

  export CFLAGS="$CFLAGS -I$(brew --prefix libmps)/include"
  export LDFLAGS="$LDFLAGS -L$(brew --prefix libmps)/lib"

Note that --with-mps=debug won't work with the Homebrew recipe.
To get a debug build, see "Building MPS yourself" below.

MS-Windows
----------

TBD

Building MPS yourself
---------------------

See the file mps/INSTALL for instructions on how to build MPS.  But in
short:

$ # Change this to an empty directory of your choosing:
$ MPS_ARTIFACTS=/path/to/mps_artifacts
$ git clone https://github.com/Ravenbrook/mps.git
$ cd mps
$ autoconf
$ ./configure --prefix="$MPS_ARTIFACTS"
$ make CC="gcc -Wno-dangling-pointer -Wno-maybe-uninitialized" \
       EXTRA_TARGETS=
$ make install

TODO: Instructions for building the debug version.  For now, see below
for some ideas.

Building MPS yourself (manually)
--------------------------------

If you have problems with the above, you can try this more manual
installation procedure:

$ git clone https://github.com/Ravenbrook/mps.git
$ cd mps/code

$ gcc -O2 -c mps.c
$ ar rvs libmps.a mps.o

Create a new empty directory of your choosing:

$ # Change this to any new empty directory:
$ MPS_ARTIFACTS="/path/to/mps-artifacts"
$ mkdir $MPS_ARTIFACTS

Now copy the header files and libmps.a there:

$ cp mps*.h libmps.a $MPS_ARTIFACTS

To copy a smaller set of headers (at the risk of needing to redo this in
the future), you could do this instead:

$ cp mps.h mpsavm.h mpscamc.h mpscams.h mpscawl.h \
     mpslib.h libmps.a $MPS_ARTIFACTS

Then you can proceed with building Emacs, telling the `configure` script
where the mps header files and libmps.a are:

$ ./configure CPPFLAGS=-I$MPS_ARTIFACTS \
              LDFLAGS=-L$MPS_ARTIFACTS \
              --with-mps=yes <... rest of options ...>

To build the debug version of MPS:

$ gcc -O0 -g -DCONFIG_VAR_COOL -c mps.c -o mps-debug.o
$ ar rvs libmps-debug.a mps-debug.o
$ cp libmps-debug.a ~/mps-artifacts

Then pass --with-mps=debug instead --with-mps=yes to the Emacs configure
script (it is recommended that you build Emacs in debug mode while
debugging MPS problems, see the INSTALL in the root directory of the
Emacs source tree.)

To make it easier to rebuild in the future, you could add this to your
~/.bashrc (or equivalent for other shells):

    export EMACS_MPS_ARTIFACTS="$HOME/mps-artifacts"

And then build by switching in that variable (with the "EMACS_" prefix)
into the commands you find above.


Debugging the MPS build
=======================

On most systems, MPS uses the SIGSEGV POSIX signal or its emulation as
part of its normal operation.  When running Emacs with MPS support in a
debugger such as GDB, it is important to take this into account, because
the debugger might stop when this signal is raised, and make it look
like Emacs segfaulted.

If you use GDB, it's recommended to use the .gdbinit file in the src/
subdirectory, which configures GDB not to stop in this situation.
Starting GDB from the src directory will cause it to automatically load
and read the file, subject to the "auto-load safe-path" setting;
alternatively, you can force GDB to read that file manually, after
starting the debugger:

  (gdb) source /path/to/emacs-igc/src/.gdbinit
