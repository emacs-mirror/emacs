This directory contains files intended to test various aspects of
Emacs's functionality.  Please help add tests!

See the file file-organization.org for the details of the directory
structure and file-naming conventions.

For tests in the manual/ subdirectory, look there for separate README
files, or look for instructions in the test files themselves.

Emacs uses ERT, Emacs Lisp Regression Testing, for testing.  See (info
"(ert)") or https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/ert/
for more information on writing and running tests.

Tests could be tagged by the developer.  In this test directory, the
following tags are recognized:

* :expensive-test
  The test needs a serious amount of time to run.  It is not intended
  to run on a regular basis by users.  Instead, it runs on demand
  only, or during regression tests.

* :nativecomp
  The test runs only if Emacs is configured with Lisp native compiler
  support.

* :unstable
  The test is under development.  It shall run on demand only.

The Makefile sets the environment variable $EMACS_TEST_DIRECTORY,
which points to this directory.  This environment variable does not
exist when the tests are run outside make.  The Makefile supports the
following targets:

* make check
  Run all tests as defined in the directory.  Expensive and unstable
  tests are suppressed.  The result of the tests for <filename>.el is
  stored in <filename>.log.

* make check-maybe
  Like "make check", but run only the tests for files which have
  unresolved prerequisites.

* make check-expensive
  Like "make check", but run also the tests marked as expensive.

* make check-all
  Like "make check", but run all tests.

* make check-<dirname>
  Like "make check", but run only the tests in test/<dirname>/*.el.
  <dirname> is a relative directory path, which has replaced "/" by "-",
  like in "check-src" or "check-lisp-net".

* make <filename>  -or-  make <filename>.log
  Run all tests declared in <filename>.el.  This includes expensive
  tests.  In the former case the output is shown on the terminal, in
  the latter case the output is written to <filename>.log.

<filename> could be either a relative file name like
"lisp/files-tests", or a package name like "files-tests".

ERT offers selectors, which make it possible to filter out which test
cases shall run.  The make variable $(SELECTOR) gives you a simple
mean to use your own selectors.  The ERT manual describes how
selectors are constructed, see (info "(ert)Test Selectors") or
https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/ert/Test-Selectors.html

You could use predefined selectors of the Makefile.  "make <filename>
SELECTOR='$(SELECTOR_DEFAULT)'" runs all tests for <filename>.el
except the tests tagged as expensive or unstable.  Other predefined
selectors are $(SELECTOR_EXPENSIVE) (run all tests except unstable
ones) and $(SELECTOR_ALL) (run all tests).

If your test file contains the tests "test-foo", "test2-foo" and
"test-foo-remote", and you want to run only the former two tests, you
could use a selector regexp (note that the "$" needs to be doubled to
protect against "make" variable expansion):

    make <filename> SELECTOR='"foo$$"'

In case you want to use the symbol name of a test as selector, you can
use it directly:

    make <filename> SELECTOR='test-foo-remote'

Note that although the test files are always compiled (unless they set
no-byte-compile), the source files will be run when expensive or
unstable tests are involved, to give nicer backtraces.  To run the
compiled version of a test use

    make TEST_LOAD_EL=no ...

Some tests might take long time to run.  In order to summarize the
<nn> tests with the longest duration, call

    make SUMMARIZE_TESTS=<nn> ...

The backtrace of failing tests are truncated to the default value of
'ert-batch-backtrace-right-margin'.  To see more of the backtrace, use

    make TEST_BACKTRACE_LINE_LENGTH=<nn> ...

The tests are run in batch mode by default; sometimes it's useful to
get precisely the same environment but run in interactive mode for
debugging.  To do that, use

    make TEST_INTERACTIVE=yes ...

By default, ERT test failure summaries are quite brief in batch
mode--only the names of the failed tests are listed.  If the
$EMACS_TEST_VERBOSE environment variable is set and non-empty, the
failure summaries will also include the data from the failing test.

If the $EMACS_TEST_JUNIT_REPORT environment variable is set to a file
name, a JUnit test report is generated under this name.

Some of the tests require a remote temporary directory
(autorevert-tests.el, dnd-tests.el, eglot-tests.el, filenotify-tests.el,
shadowfile-tests.el and tramp-tests.el).  Per default, a mock-up
connection method is used (this might not be possible when running on
MS Windows).  If you want to test a real remote connection, set
$REMOTE_TEMPORARY_FILE_DIRECTORY to a suitable value in order to
overwrite the default value:

    env REMOTE_TEMPORARY_FILE_DIRECTORY=/ssh:host:/tmp make ...


There are also continuous integration tests on
<https://hydra.nixos.org/jobset/gnu/emacs-trunk> (see
admin/notes/hydra) and <https://emba.gnu.org/emacs/emacs> (see
admin/notes/emba).  Both environments provide an environment variable,
which could be used to determine, whether the tests run in one of
these test environments.

$EMACS_HYDRA_CI indicates the hydra environment, and $EMACS_EMBA_CI
indicates the emba environment, respectively.

If tests on these premises take too long, and it is needed to create a
core dump for further analysis, the environment variable
$EMACS_TEST_TIMEOUT could set a limit (in seconds) when this shall
happen.
