;;; Commentary:

;; The command `cus-test-deps' loads all (!) custom dependencies and
;; reports about load errors.

;;; Code:

(require 'ert)

(defconst custom-test-admin-cus-test
  (expand-file-name "admin/cus-test.el" source-directory))

(declare-function cus-test-deps custom-test-admin-cus-test)
(defvar cus-test-deps-errors)  ; from admin/cus-tests.el

(ert-deftest test-custom-deps ()
  :tags '(:expensive-test)
  (skip-unless (file-readable-p custom-test-admin-cus-test))
  (load custom-test-admin-cus-test)
  (cus-test-deps)
  (should-not cus-test-deps-errors))
