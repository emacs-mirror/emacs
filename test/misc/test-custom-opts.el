(defconst custom-test-admin-cus-test
  (expand-file-name "admin/cus-test.el" source-directory))

(declare-function cus-test-opts custom-test-admin-cus-test)

(ert-deftest check-for-wrong-custom-opts ()
  :tags '(:expensive-test)
  (skip-unless (file-readable-p custom-test-admin-cus-test))
  (load custom-test-admin-cus-test)
  (should (null (cus-test-opts t))))
