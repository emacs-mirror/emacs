;;; Commentary:

;; The command `cus-test-noloads' returns a list of variables which
;; are somewhere declared as custom options, but not loaded by
;; `custom-load-symbol'.

;;; Code:

(require 'ert)

(declare-function cus-test-noloads custom-test-admin-cus-test)
(defvar cus-test-vars-not-cus-loaded)  ; from admin/cus-tests.el

;; FIXME: Multiple failures here.
