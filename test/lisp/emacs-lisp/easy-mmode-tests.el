;;;; Globalized minor modes

;; Globalized minor modes can either enable or decline to enable their
;; minor mode for a given buffer.  That means you can have more than one
;; globalized version of a single minor mode, where they enable it in
;; different buffers.  This combination is legitimate because globalized
;; minor modes don't ever *disable* the minor mode in a buffer, so the
;; only possibilities are that either one or more of them enable the
;; minor mode, or none of them do.
;;
;; We have had problems with a particular case of this with two
;; globalized versions of a minor mode where the buffers in which one
;; globalized mode enables the minor mode are a strict superset of the
;; buffers in which the other globalized mode enables the minor mode:
;; `magit-auto-revert-mode' enables `auto-revert-mode' for all
;; Git-managed files and `vc-auto-revert-mode' enables it for all VCS
;; managed files with any VC backend.  These tests are to assert that
;; this combination still works.
;;
;; As an additional complication, `auto-revert-mode' is marked
;; permanent-local, so we involve that in the test, again to assert that
;; the combination still works.
