This is a test of `faceup', a regression test system for font-lock
keywords. It should use major mode `faceup-test-mode'.

WARNING: The first word on this line should use
`font-lock-warning-face', and a tooltip should be displayed if the
mouse pointer is moved over it.

In this mode "<" and ">" are parentheses, but only when on the same
line without any other "<" and ">" characters between them.
<OK> <NOT <OK> >

NOT OK
