;;; Commentary:

;; Testcover test suite.
;; * All the test cases are in testcover-resources/testcover-cases.el.
;;   See that file for an explanation of the test case format.
;; * `testcover-tests-define-tests', which is run when this file is
;;   loaded, reads testcover-resources/testcover-cases.el and defines
;;   ERT tests for each test case.
