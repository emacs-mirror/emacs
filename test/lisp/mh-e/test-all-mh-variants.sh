# Commentary:

# By default runs all tests; test names or Emacs-style regexps may be
# given on the command line to run just those tests.
#
# Option -d turns on Emacs variable mh-test-utils-debug-mocks, which
# causes the tests to output all interactions with the file system.

# If you want to run the tests for only one MH variant, you don't need
# to use this script, because "make" can do it.  See the commentary at
# the top of ./mh-utils-tests.el for the recipe.
