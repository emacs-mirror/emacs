;;; Commentary:

;; This test suite runs tests that use and depend on MH programs
;; installed on the system.

;; When running such tests, MH-E can use a particular MH variant
;; installed on the system, or it can use the mocks provided here.
;; (Setup is done by the `with-mh-test-env' macro.)

;; By setting environment variable TEST_MH_PATH, you can select which of
;; the installed MH variants to use, or ignore them all and use mocks.
;; See also the script test-all-mh-variants.sh in this directory.

;; 1.  To run these tests against the default MH variant installed on
;;     this system:
;; cd ../.. && make lisp/mh-e/mh-utils-tests

;; 2.  To run these tests against an MH variant installed in a
;;     specific directory, set TEST_MH_PATH, as in this example:
;; cd ../.. && make lisp/mh-e/mh-utils-tests TEST_MH_PATH=/usr/local/nmh/bin

;; 3.  To search for and run these tests against all MH variants
;;     installed on this system:
;; ./test-all-mh-variants.sh

;; Setting the environment variable TEST_MH_DEBUG or the Lisp variable
;; mh-test-utils-debug-mocks logs access to the file system during the test.
