;;; Commentary:

;; Moved here from test/manual/cedet/semantic-tests.el

;;; Code:

(require 'ert)
(require 'semantic/fw)

;;; From semantic-fw:

(ert-deftest semantic-test-data-cache ()
  "Test the data cache."
  (let ((data '(a b c)))
    (with-current-buffer (get-buffer-create " *semantic-test-data-cache*")
      (erase-buffer)
      (insert "The Moose is Loose")
      (goto-char (point-min))
      (semantic-cache-data-to-buffer (current-buffer) (point) (+ (point) 5)
                                     data 'moose 'exit-cache-zone)
      ;; retrieve cached data
      (should (equal (semantic-get-cache-data 'moose) data)))))

;;; fw-tests.el ends here
