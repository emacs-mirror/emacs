;;; Commentary:

;; Tests for stuff in dnd.el that doesn't require a window system.

;; The drag API tests only check the behavior of the simplified drag
;; APIs in dnd.el.  Actual drags are not performed during the
;; automated testing process (make check), but some of the tests can
;; also be run under X.

(require 'dnd)
(require 'cl-lib)
(require 'tramp)
(require 'select)
(require 'ert-x)
