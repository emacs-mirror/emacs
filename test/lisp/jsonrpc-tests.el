;;; Commentary:

;; About "deferred" tests, `jsonrpc--test-client' has a flag that we
;; test in its `jsonrpc-connection-ready-p' API method.  It holds any
;; `jsonrpc-request's and `jsonrpc-async-request's explicitly passed
;; `:deferred'.  After clearing the flag, the held requests are
;; actually sent to the server in the next opportunity (when receiving
;; or sending something to the server).
