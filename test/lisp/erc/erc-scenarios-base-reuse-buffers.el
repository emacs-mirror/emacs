;; This also asserts that `erc-cmd-JOIN' is no longer susceptible to a

;; buffers of the form target/server to be created via
;; `switch-to-buffer' ("phantom" because they would go unused").  This
;; would happen (in place of a JOIN being sent out) when a previously
;; used (parted) target buffer existed and `erc-reuse-buffers' was
;; nil.
;;
;; Note: All the `erc-get-channel-user' calls have to do with the fact
;; that `erc-default-target' relies on the ambiguously defined
;; `erc-default-recipients' (meaning it's overloaded in the sense of
;; being used both for retrieving a target name and checking if a
;; channel has been PARTed).  While not ideal, `erc-get-channel-user'
;; can (also) be used to detect the latter.
