;; You register a new nick in a dedicated query buffer, disconnect,
;; and log back in, but your nick is not granted (maybe you just
;; turned off SASL).  In any case, ERC obtains a backtick'd version.
;; You open a query buffer for NickServ, and ERC gives you the
;; existing one.  And after you identify, all buffers retain their
;; names, although your net ID has changed internally.
;;
;; If ERC would've instead failed (or intentionally refused) to make
;; the association, you would've ended up with a new NickServ buffer
;; named after the new net ID as a suffix (based on the backtick'd
;; nick), for example, NickServ@foonet/tester`.  And the original
;; (disconnected) NickServ buffer would've gotten suffixed with *its*
;; net-ID as well, e.g., NickServ@foonet/tester.  And after
;; identifying, you would've seen ERC merge the two as well as their
;; server buffers.  While this alternate behavior may arguably be a
;; more honest reflection of reality, it's also quite inconvenient.
;; For a clearer example, see the original version of this file
;; introduced by "Add user-oriented test scenarios for ERC".
