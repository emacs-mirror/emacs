;;; Commentary:

;; The utilities here are kept separate from those in `erc-d' so that
;; tests running the server in a subprocess can use them without
;; having to require the main lib.  If migrating outside of test/lisp,
;; there may be no reason to continue this.
;;
;; Another (perhaps misguided) goal here is to avoid having ERC itself
;; as a dependency.
;;
;; FIXME this ^ is no longer the case (ERC is not a dependency)
