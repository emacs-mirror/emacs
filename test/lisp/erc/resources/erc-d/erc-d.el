;;; Commentary:

;; This is a netcat style server for testing ERC.  The "d" in the name
;; stands for "daemon" as well as for "dialog" (as well as for "dumb"
;; because this server isn't very smart).  It either spits out a
;; canned reply when an incoming request matches the expected regexp
;; or signals an error and dies.  The entry point function is
;; `erc-d-run'.
;;
;; Canned scripts, or "dialogs," should be Lisp-Data files containing
;; one or more request/reply forms like this:
;;
;; |  ((mode-chan 1.5 "MODE #chan")          ; request: tag, expr, regex
;; |   (0.1 ":irc.org 324 bob #chan +Cint")  ; reply: delay, content
;; |   (0.0 ":irc.org 329 bob #chan 12345")) ; reply: ...
;;
;; These are referred to as "exchanges."  The first element is a list
;; whose CAR is a descriptive "tag" and whose CDR is an incoming
;; "spec" representing an inbound message from the client.  The rest
;; of the exchange is composed of outgoing specs representing
;; server-to-client messages.  A tag can be any symbol (ideally unique
;; in the dialog), but a leading tilde means the request should be
;; allowed to arrive out of order (within the allotted time).
;;
;; The first element in an incoming spec is a number indicating the
;; maximum number of seconds to wait for a match before raising an
;; error.  The CDR is interpreted as the collective arguments of an
;; `rx' form to be matched against the raw request (stripped of its
;; CRLF line ending).  A "string-start" backslash assertion, "\\`", is
;; prepended to all patterns.
;;
;; Similarly, the leading number in an *outgoing* spec indicates how
;; many seconds to wait before sending the line, which is rendered by
;; concatenating the other members after evaluating each in place.
;; CRLF line endings are appended on the way out and should be absent.
;;
;; Recall that IRC is "asynchronous," meaning some flow intervals
;; don't jibe with lockstep request-reply semantics.  However, for our
;; purposes, grouping things as [input, output1, ..., outputN] makes
;; sense, even though input and output may be completely unrelated.
;;
;; Template interpolation:
;;
;; A rudimentary templating facility is provided for additional
;; flexibility.  However, it's best to keep things simple (even if
;; overly verbose), so others can easily tell what's going on at a
;; glance.  If necessary, consult existing tests for examples (grep
;; for the variables `erc-d-tmpl-vars' and `erc-d-match-handlers').
;;
;; Subprocess or in-process?:
;;
;; Running in-process confers better visibility and easier setup at
;; the cost of additional cleanup and resource wrangling.  With a
;; subprocess, cleanup happens by pulling the plug, but configuration
;; means loading a separate file or passing -eval "(forms...)" during
;; invocation.  In some cases, a subprocess may be the only option,
;; like when trying to avoid `require'ing this file.
;;
;; Dialog objects:
;;
;; For a given exchange, the first argument passed to a request
;; handler is the `erc-d-dialog' object representing the overall
;; conversation with the connecting peer.  It can be used to pass
;; information between handlers during a session.  Some important
;; items are:
;;
;; * name (symbol); name of the current dialog
;;
;; * queue (ring); a backlog of unhandled raw requests, minus CRLF
;; endings.
;;
;; * timers (list of timers); when run, these send messages originally
;; deferred as per the most recently matched exchange's delay info.
;; Normally, all outgoing messages must be sent before another request
;; is considered.  (See `erc-d--send-outgoing' for an escape hatch.)
;;
;; * hunks (iterator of iterators); unconsumed exchanges as read from
;; a Lisp-Data dialog file.  The exchange iterators being dispensed
;; themselves yield portions of member forms as a 2- or 3-part
;; sequence: [tag] spec.  (Here, "hunk" just means "list of raw,
;; unrendered exchange elements")
;;
;; * vars (alist of cons pairs); for sharing state among template
;; functions during the lifetime of an exchange.  Initially populated
;; by `erc-d-tmpl-vars', these KEY/VALUE pairs are expanded in the
;; templates and optionally updated by "exchange handlers" (see
;; `erc-d-match-handlers').  When VALUE is a function, occurrences of
;; KEY in an outgoing spec are replaced with the result of calling
;; VALUE with match data set appropriately.  See
;; `erc-d--render-entries' for details.
;;
;; * exchanges (ring of erc-d-exchange objects); activated hunks
;; allowed to match out of order, plus the current active exchange
;; being yielded from, if any. See `erc-d-exchange'.
;;
;; TODO
;;
;; - Remove un(der)used functionality and simplify API
;; - Maybe migrate d-u and d-i dependencies here

example, a key/value pair like (network . \"oftc\") will cause instances
of the (unquoted) symbol `network' to be replaced with \"oftc\" in the
rendered template string.

This list provides default template bindings common to all dialogs.
Each new client-connection process makes a shallow copy on init, but the
usual precautions apply when mutating member items.  Within the span of
a dialog, updates not applicable to all exchanges should die with their
exchange.  See `erc-d--render-entries' for details.  In the unlikely

  "Act as an iterator producing rendered strings from EXCHANGE hunks.
When an entry's CAR is an arbitrary symbol, yield that back first, and
consider the entry an \"incoming\" entry.  Then, regardless of the
entry's type (incoming or outgoing), yield back the next element, which
should be a number representing either a timeout (incoming) or a
delay (outgoing).  After that, yield a rendered template (outgoing) or a
regular expression (incoming); both should be treated as immutable.

When evaluating a template, bind the keys in the alist stored in the
dialog's `vars' field to its values, but skip any self-quoters, like
:foo.  When an entry is incoming, replace occurrences of a key with its
value, which can be any valid `rx' form (see Info node `(elisp)
Extending Rx').  Do the same when an entry is outgoing, but expect a
value's form to be (anything that evaluates to) something acceptable by
`concat' or, alternatively, a function that returns a string or nil.

Repeat the last two steps for the remaining entries, all of which are
assumed to be outgoing.  That is, continue yielding a timeout/delay and
a rendered string for each entry, and yield nil when exhausted.

Once again, for an incoming entry, the yielded string is a regexp to be
matched against the raw request.  For outgoing, it's the final response,
ready to be sent out (after adding the appropriate line ending).

To help with testing, bindings are not automatically created from
DIALOG's \"vars\" alist when this function is invoked.  But this can be
forced by sending a non-nil YIELD-RESULT into the generator on the
second \"next\" invocation of a given iteration.  This clobbers any
temporary bindings that don't exist in the DIALOG's `vars' alist, such
as those added via `erc-d-exchange-rebind' (unless \"exported\").

As noted earlier, template symbols can be bound to functions.  When
called during rendering, the match data from the current (matched)
request is accessible by calling the function `match-data'.

A function may ask for up to two required args, which are provided as
needed.  When applicable, the first required arg is a `funcall'-able
helper that accepts various keyword-based commands, like :rebind, and a
variable number of args.  See `erc-d-exchange-multi' for details.  When
specified, the second required arg is the current `erc-d-exchange'
object, which has among its members its owning `erc-d-dialog' object.
This should suffice as a safety valve for any corner-case needs.
Non-required args are ignored."

A dialog must be a symbol matching the base name of a dialog file in

(defun erc-d-serve ()
  "Start serving canned dialogs from the command line.
Although not autoloaded, this function is meant to be summoned via the
Emacs -f flag while starting a batch session.  It prints incoming and
outgoing messages to standard out.

The main options are --host HOST and --port PORT, which default to
localhost and auto, respectively.  The args are the dialogs to run.
Unlike with `erc-d-run', dialogs here *must* be files, meaning Lisp-Data
files adhering to the required format.  (These consist of \"specs\"
detailing timing and template info; see commentary for specifics.)

An optional --add-time N option can also be passed to hike up timeouts
by some number of seconds N.  For example, you might run:

  $ emacs -Q -batch -L . \\
  >   -l erc-d.el \\
  >   -f erc-d-serve \\
  >   --host 192.168.124.1 \\
  >   --port 16667 \\
  >   --add-time 10 \\
  >   ./my-dialog.eld

from a Makefile or manually with \\<global-map>\\[compile]. And then in
another terminal, do:

  $ nc -C 192.168.124.1 16667 ; or telnet if your nc doesn't have -C
  > PASS changeme
  ...

Use `erc-d-run' instead to start the server from within Emacs."
