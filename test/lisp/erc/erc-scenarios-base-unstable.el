;; The `erc-networks' library has slowly become a hard dependency of

;; module, which was added in ERC 5.3 (2008) and thereafter loaded by
;; default, only became quasi-required in ERC 5.5 (2022).  Despite
;; this, a basic connection should still always succeed, at least long
;; enough to warn users that their setup is abnormal.  Of course,
;; third-party code intentionally omitting the module will have to
;; override various erc-server-*-functions to avoid operating in a
;; degraded state, which has likely been the case for a while.
