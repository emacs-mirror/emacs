;;; Commentary:

;; Test cases covering URI reference resolution as described in RFC3986,
;; section 5. Reference Resolution and especially the relative resolution
;; rules specified in section 5.2. Relative Resolution.

;; Each test calls `url-expand-file-name', typically with a relative
;; reference URI and a base URI as string and compares the result (Actual)
;; against a manually specified URI (Expected)
