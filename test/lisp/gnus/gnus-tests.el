;;; Commentary:

;; This file should contain nothing but requires for all the Gnus
;; tests that are not standalone.

;;; Code:
;; registry.el is required by gnus-registry.el but this way we're explicit.
(require 'registry)
(require 'gnus-registry)

(provide 'gnus-tests)
;;; gnus-tests.el ends here
