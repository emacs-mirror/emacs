;;; Commentary:

;; Most of these tests use the shebang #!emacs to get `normal-mode' to
;; select `emacs-lisp-mode', as using a file-local mode variable would
;; usually trigger `so-long-file-local-mode-function'.  In cases where
;; we need to `hack-local-variables', we instead set `buffer-file-name'.
;; (We could consistently use the latter, but the mixture of approaches
;; means that we're testing more things.)

;; Running manually:
;;
;; for test in lisp/so-long-tests/*-tests.el; do make ${test%.el}; done \
;; 2>&1 | egrep -v '^(Loading|Source file|make|Changed to so-long-mode)'
;;
;; Which is equivalent to:
;;
;; for test in lisp/so-long-tests/*-tests.el; do \
;; HOME=/nonexistent EMACSLOADPATH= LC_ALL=C EMACS_TEST_DIRECTORY=. \
;; "../src/emacs" --no-init-file --no-site-file --no-site-lisp \
;; -L ":." -l ert -l "$test" --batch --eval \
;; '(ert-run-tests-batch-and-exit (quote (not (tag :unstable))))'; \
;; done 2>&1 | egrep -v '^(Loading|Source file|Changed to so-long-mode)'
