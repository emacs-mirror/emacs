  "Check to make sure we successfully ignore trailing -- made by
'git format-patch'. This is bug #9597"

  ;; I made a test repo, put some files in it, made arbitrary changes
  ;; and invoked 'git format-patch' to get a patch out of it.  The
  ;; patch and the before and after versions of the files appear here.
  ;; The test simply tries to apply the patch.  The patch contains
  ;; trailing --, which confused diff-mode previously
