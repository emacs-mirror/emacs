;;; Commentary:

;; Some of the tests require access to a remote host files.  Since
;; this could be problematic, a mock-up connection method "mock" is
;; used.  Emulating a remote connection, it simply calls "sh -i".
;; Tramp's file name handlers still run, so this test is sufficient
;; except for connection establishing.

;; If you want to test a real Tramp connection, set
;; $REMOTE_TEMPORARY_FILE_DIRECTORY to a suitable value in order to
;; overwrite the default value.  If you want to skip tests accessing a
;; remote host, set this environment variable to "/dev/null" or
;; whatever is appropriate on your system.

;; A whole test run can be performed calling the command `file-notify-test-all'.

;;; Code:

(require 'ert)
(require 'ert-x)
(require 'filenotify)
(require 'tramp)

;; There is no default value on w32 systems, which could work out of the box.

;; TODO:

;; * kqueue does not send all expected `deleted' events.  Maybe due to
;;   the missing directory monitor.
;; * For w32notify, no `deleted' and `stopped' events arrive when a
;;   directory is removed.
;; * For cygwin and w32notify, no `attribute-changed' events arrive.
;;   They send `changed' events instead.
;; * cygwin does not send all expected `changed' and `deleted' events.
;;   Probably due to timing issues.
