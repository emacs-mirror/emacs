;;; Commentary:

;; Some of the tests require access to a remote host files.  Since
;; this could be problematic, a mock-up connection method "mock" is
;; used.  Emulating a remote connection, it simply calls "sh -i".
;; Tramp's file name handlers still run, so this test is sufficient
;; except for connection establishing.

;; If you want to test a real Tramp connection, set
;; $REMOTE_TEMPORARY_FILE_DIRECTORY to a suitable value in order to
;; overwrite the default value.  If you want to skip tests accessing a
;; remote host, set this environment variable to "/dev/null" or
;; whatever is appropriate on your system.

;; For the remote file-notify library, Tramp checks for the existence of
;; a respective command.  The first command found is used.  In order to
;; use a dedicated one, the environment variable
;; $REMOTE_FILE_NOTIFY_LIBRARY shall be set, possible values are
;; "inotifywait", "gio", and "smb-notify".

;; Local file-notify libraries are auto-detected during Emacs
;; configuration.  This can be changed with a respective configuration
;; argument, like
;;
;;   --with-file-notification=inotify
;;   --with-file-notification=kqueue
;;   --with-file-notification=gfile
;;   --with-file-notification=w32

;; A whole test run can be performed calling the command `file-notify-test-all'.
