    ;; well as which arguments were passed to the hooks.

    ;; "x" into the test case's buffer.

    ;; `replace': replace the first occurrence of the given string in
    ;; the test case's buffer with "x".  The test will fail if the
    ;; string is not found.

    ;; `expected-calls': a description of the expected buffer
    ;; modification hooks.  See
    ;; `overlay-tests-get-recorded-modification-hooks' for the format.
