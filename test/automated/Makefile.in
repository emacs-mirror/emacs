### Commentary:

## Some targets:
## check: re-run all tests, writing to .log files.
## check-maybe: run all tests whose .log file needs updating
## filename.log: run tests from filename.el(c) if .log file needs updating
## filename: re-run tests from filename.el(c), with no logging

### Code:

srcdir = @srcdir@
VPATH = $(srcdir)

# We never change directory before running Emacs, so a relative file
# name is fine, and makes life easier.  If we need to change
# directory, we can use emacs --chdir.

# Command line flags for Emacs.
# Apparently MSYS bash would convert "-L :" to "-L ;" anyway,
# but we might as well be explicit.

## We need to use $loadfile because:
## i) -L :$srcdir -l basename does not work, because we have files whose
## basename duplicates a file in lisp/ (eg eshell.el).
## ii) Although -l basename will automatically load .el or .elc,
## -l ./basename treats basename as a literal file (it would be nice
## to change this; bug#17848 - if that gets done, this can be simplified).
##
## Beware: it approximates `no-byte-compile', so watch out for false-positives!
